SCP-7951-1 and SCP-7951-2 together.
**Special Containment Procedures:** Researcher Paul Jones must remain aware of possible SCP-7951 manifestations. For the preservation of normalcy, Jones is to observe extra vigilance regarding romantic occasions, family dinners, and moderate social gatherings of 3-7 people.
**Description:** SCP-7951 is the designation for the spontaneous physical manifestation of two coffee mugs within the personal home of Researcher Paul Jones.
SCP-7951-1 is a nondescript ceramic mug invariably filled with a black tea beverage at or below 23 degrees Celsius. Subjects who perceive SCP-7951-1 believe that the liquid inside is "not how they like their tea" and upon tasting the beverage will note that it is "too cold" in addition to a series of other subjective qualitative notes. The exception to this is Researcher Paul Jones, who says that the liquid inside is "exactly how [he likes] it."
SCP-7951-2 is empty.
**Discovery:** SCP-7951 was discovered in the home of Researcher Paul Jones shortly after the finalization of inheritance proceedings on 10/15/2023. When questioned, Jones stated, "My room's still how I left it."
