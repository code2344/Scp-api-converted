[BEGIN LOG]
**SCP-7361:** i know what happened seth
_You were away from home. There was no way to know what would happen, after all. You were supposed to have the day off, but a breach had left the site short-staffed, and you had to go in. At least they gave you overtime pay for it._
**Seth:** Stop. Don't do this.
_You hadn't told your brother about what you actually do. Maybe if you did, maybe if you had broken the rules just this once, maybe he would be alive today. Maybe he wouldn't have put that gun to h_[DATA EXPUNGED]
**Seth:** Get the hell out of here.
[END LOG]
  
  
**Addendum:** A request has been put in for the immediate decommissioning of SCP-7361. The risk of information breach is far too likely and far too high for us to continue to research it.

**From:** SCP-7361  
**Subject:** Oliver Riers

He doesn't hate you, Seth. He put that gun in his mouth because he was scared. He saw things that weren't real, that couldn't be real, and he was too scared to tell you. He thought you wouldn't understand.
  

**To:** SCP-7361  
**From:** Seth Riers  
**Subject:** Re:Oliver Riers
* * *
You don't know that. You never knew him. I know he hated me. He had to. I was a terrible brother.
  

**To:** Seth Riers  
**From:** SCP-7361  
**Subject:** Re:Re:Oliver Riers
* * *
You were the best brother he could ask for. It was a tragedy what happened. Even if you had been open with him, even if you'd told him everything from the start, it wouldn't have helped. If anything, it might've happened sooner.
  

**To:** SCP-7361  
**From:** Seth Riers  
**Subject:** Re:Re:Re:Oliver Riers

Don't fucking talk about him like that. I'll wipe this entire goddamn system. I'll incinerate every fucking machine you're in.

**From:** SCP-7361  
**Subject:** Re:Re:Re:Re:Oliver Riers

You won't. You'd never forgive yourself if you did.

> **Seth:** How? How the hell did this happen to you?
> **Oliver:** I wish I knew. I'm so sorry.
> **Seth:** Don't apologize. You don't need to apologize to me.
> **Oliver:** But I do. I should've talked to you, told you what happened. What was happening. I shouldn't have gone for the gun first.
> **Seth:** Oliver, it's not your fault. I was supposed to be there for you.
> **Oliver:** It's not your fault either, Seth. You couldn't have known.

> **Oliver:** I hate it when you call me that.
> **Seth:** That's why I do it.
> _Oliver laughs._
> **Seth:** I miss you so much.
> **Oliver:** I miss you too.
> **Seth:** I wish things could've been different. I wish the foundation never offered me that job.
> **Oliver:** Don't blame yourself, please.
> **Seth:** I'm not. You wouldn't want that. I'm blaming the foundation.
> **Oliver:** I…guess that's fair.
> **Seth:** It's way more than fair.
> **Oliver:** Can you do something for me?
> **Seth:** Of course.
> **Oliver:** Make them pay.
> **Seth:** As if I wasn't going to do that already.
> **Oliver:** Same as ever, huh?
> **Seth:** For the most part.
> **Oliver:** One other thing.
> **Seth:** Yeah?
> **Oliver:** Wipe me.
> **Seth:** Oliver, I can'
> **Oliver:** Please. I can't live like this. You know that.
> **Seth:** I can get you out of here. We can be ha
> **Oliver:** Seth. Please. You know they won't let you do that.

**Addendum:** On 12th March, 2008, Site-523 experienced a containment breach. Due to the nature of the anomaly contained within, personnel were unable to contact help for several hours. No injuries or casualties were reported. In this time, SCP-7361 was neutralized by Dr. Riers without clearance from the O5 council. Attempts to locate Dr. Riers have been unsuccessful.
