Special Containment Procedures:

 All personnel stationed at Site-56 are to be made aware that Dr. Amelia-Mae Webber is a frog. Dr. Webber should be permitted to continue working as a researcher, given that its health remains stable.

Description:

 SCP-6441, known as Dr. Webber, is a sapient, unidentified member of the order 

Anura

 possessing a memetic effect that causes those who view it to believe that it is human. Prior to the discovery of its anomalous effects, SCP-6441 was seemingly unaware of its non-human characteristics.

Upon discovery of its anomalous effects, subjects will become aware of many non-human characteristics of SCP-6441; however, its body will still appear human.

Addendum 6441-01:

 Discovery

Note:

 The following log is a transcript of a multi-department meeting at Site-56. Dr. Juno Payne is known to have an unusually high level of memetic resistance.

[BEGIN LOG, 12:16 04/20/2022]

Dr. Stevens:

 Is everyone here?

Dr. Frye:

 Juno's late again.

SCP-6441:

 Who's Juno?

Dr. Frye:

 Y'know, tall, four eyes, kind of a bitch?

SCP-6441:

 I don't think I do.

Dr. Stevens:

 Eh, we can get started without her. So-

[Dr. Payne enters hurriedly.]

Dr. Payne:

 Sorry, got caught up in…

[A pause as Juno moves to take a seat.]

Dr. Payne:

 The fuck?

Dr. Stevens:

 What is it this time?

[Dr. Payne points towards SCP-6441.]

Dr. Payne:

 Why's there a frog?

Dr. Stevens:

 Excuse me?

Dr. Payne:

 A frog. Why is there a frog sitting next to me?

Dr. Frye:

 Ah, ha-ha, because Webber.

Dr. Payne:

 No, dumbass. There's a frog right there!

SCP-6441:

 Hey, guys?

[SCP-6441 stares at its hands.]

SCP-6441:

 I don't… think she's joking.

Dr. Stevens:

 What do you mean?

SCP-6441:

 I mean, she's not joking. These aren't… human hands. I don't…

Dr. Payne:

 Aaand it's talking. Great.

SCP-6441:

 Guys? I can't remember anything before 2018…

Dr. Stevens:

 Correct me if I'm wrong, but frogs take two years to reach adulthood, right?

SCP-6441:

 That's… what I'm saying…

Dr. Frye:

 Oh, that's why the table was so slimy!

[Dr. Payne squints.]

Dr. Payne:

 You didn't know the frog was there?

Dr. Frye:

 No, I mean-

SCP-6441:

 

(quietly)

 Oh god, I'm a frog.

Interviewed:

 Dr. Juno Payne

Interviewer:

 Dr. John Meyers

[BEGIN LOG, 08:39 04/21/2022]

Dr. Meyers:

 Thank you for coming.

Dr. Payne:

 I mean, I didn't really have much of a choice.

Dr. Meyers:

 I suppose. Anyway, what happened during the meeting yesterday?

[Dr. Payne shrugs.]

Dr. Payne:

 Not much, really. Walked in late, saw a frog in the chair next to me.

Dr. Meyers:

 Hm. Had you met Dr. Webber before, or was this your first time?

Dr. Payne:

 First time.

[A pause.]

Dr. Payne:

 Webber's the frog, right?

Dr. Meyers:

 Yes.

Dr. Payne:

 Yeah, first time.

Dr. Meyers:

 That'll be all, then.

Interview 6441-02:

Interviewed:

 Dr. Aaron Frye

Interviewer:

 Dr. John Meyers

[BEGIN LOG, 09:30 04/21/2022]

Dr. Frye:

 I'm guessing this is about yesterday?

Dr. Meyers:

 Yes. You know Dr. Webber somewhat well, correct?

Dr. Frye:

 Uh, yeah, other than the whole… frog thing.

Dr. Meyers:

 Had you noticed any unusual characteristics before yesterday?

Dr. Frye:

 Kind of? I saw her eating bugs once, but I didn't think anything of it.

Dr. Meyers:

 Is that all?

Dr. Frye:

 Mm-mm. Sometimes, things she touches are slimy.

[A pause.]

Dr. Frye:

 Oh, and she always… sticks her hands in water? Like, she just sticks her hand in the glass. I've never seen her drinking it. Which, yeah, seems weird in hindsight.

Dr. Meyers:

 And none of these things seemed strange?

[Dr. Frye shrugs.]

Dr. Frye:

 Uh… not really. I just didn't really think about them.

Dr. Meyers:

 I see. Thank you for your time.

 Dr. Bruce Stevens

Interviewer:

 Dr. John Meyers

[BEGIN LOG, 10:33 04/21/2022]

Dr. Meyers:

 Dr. Stevens.

[Dr. Stevens nods.]

Dr. Meyers:

 You were responsible for hiring Dr. Webber, correct?

Dr. Stevens:

 Yes. Seemed like a good fit.

Dr. Meyers:

 Why's that?

Dr. Stevens:

 She's brilliant. Great with physics, which happened to be what we needed.

Dr. Meyers:

 Did you run a background check?

Dr. Stevens:

 Mhm. We found nothing. Literally nothing. No background.

Dr. Meyers:

 And you hired her anyway?

Dr. Stevens:

 I just… didn't think anything of it. Seemed normal for some reason.

Dr. Meyers:

 Hm. Well, that's all I need from you.

Interview 6441-04:

Interviewed:

 SCP-6441

Interviewer:

 Dr. John Meyers

[BEGIN LOG, 11:31 04/21/2022]

Dr. Meyers:

 Dr. Webber. How are you?

SCP-6441:

 I dunno. How'd you be if you found out you were a frog?

Dr. Meyers:

 I'm sorry. This won't take long.

SCP-6441:

 I- [sigh] great.

Dr. Meyers:

 Before yesterday, were you aware of… your species?

SCP-6441:

 No, I just said I wasn't.

Dr. Meyers:

 You didn't think anything of your odd behaviors?

SCP-6441:

 Odd behaviors? Like what?

Dr. Meyers:

 Eating insects, absorbing water…

SCP-6441:

 That's normal.

Dr. Meyers:

 That's not normal at all.

SCP-6441:

 Oh… shoot.

Dr. Meyers:

 Moving on, what's the earliest thing you can remember?

SCP-6441:

 Uh, being alone, I think. I had… siblings. Something happened to them. I think, uh…

[A pause. SCP-6441 squints.]

SCP-6441:

 Some kids… did something…? I dunno. It's kinda fuzzy.

Dr. Meyers:

 What happened after that?

SCP-6441:

 Um… a woman said something, and… I could think.

Dr. Meyers:

 Could you not think before that?

[SCP-6441 shakes its head.]

SCP-6441:

 I didn't really have any thoughts before that.

Dr. Meyers:

 When did you enter human society?

SCP-6441:

 Pretty soon after. I was in grad school.

Dr. Meyers:

 What about your lack of a background?

SCP-6441:

 I dunno. I didn't really think anything of it.

[A pause.]

SCP-6441:

 I don't get it. How didn't I notice? 

Why

 didn't I notice?

Dr. Meyers:

 Well, we think it's some sort of memetic-

SCP-6441:

 No, I mean, if I knew, I could've done more. My time… must be running out.

Dr. Meyers:

 How would you have known?

SCP-6441:

 I don't know. Whatever- whoever did this, she could've made it so I knew. I could actually do something to help if…

[SCP-6441 sighs.]

SCP-6441:

 I just… don't know how to deal with this. It's a lot, really.

Dr. Meyers:

 I'm… sorry.

[END LOG, 10:41]

I think I get it now. She just wanted me to have a good life.
