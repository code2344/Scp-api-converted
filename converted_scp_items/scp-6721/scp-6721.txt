 SCP-6721 has been detained at Treatment Area-21. Two armed guards must be stationed outside its cell at all times. Access to the subject for interview purposes is forbidden except by express written permission from the Director. Subject is extremely combatative and dangerous; escape is likely. Subject is to be monitored at all times for suicide attempts, which must be prevented. In the event of containment breach, however, use of deadly force is authorized in preference to exposing personnel to the subject.

.

Khonsu-class anomalies require immediate research, as prompt neutralization is expected.

Addendum 6721-1, Discovery:

 SCP-6721 was discovered at Area-21 on 01/03/2023, spreading an infectious infohazard to active personnel. Earlier acts of sabotage have been retroactively attributed to the subject. An abridged transcript of the final altercation is appended below.

<Log begins.>

<SCP-6721 is standing with its back to an elevator door, pointing a standard issue firearm at Junior Researcher Catherine Wilt and her escort of security personnel, approximately twenty feet away.>

SCP-6721:

 [COGNITOHAZARD EXPUNGED].

Wilt:

 You don't mean that.

SCP-6721:

 [COGNITOHAZARD EXPUNGED]!

<SCP-6721 looks directly into the security camera.>

SCP-6721:

 [COGNITOHAZARD EXPUNGED]!

Wilt:

 You can't spread your lies to me. I'm immune, and so are these men and women. Just give up.

SCP-6721:

 [COGNITOHAZARD EXPUNGED].

Wilt:

 No, you're not. You've done all the damage you're going to do, here. You'll never get the chance to—

<SCP-6721 fires its weapon into the floor tiles in front of Wilt.>

SCP-6721:

 [COGNITOHAZARD EXPUNGED]!

Wilt:

 Fine. Take the elevator when it comes, and get out of here. Nobody's going to stop you, because we're not what you think we are. Not at all.

<SCP-6721 narrows its eyes at Wilt, then steps away from the elevator door.>

Wilt:

 What are you doing?

<SCP-6721 flees down a side passage as the elevator doors open to reveal four more armed guards.>

Wilt:

 There's nowhere to run!

<SCP-6721 eludes pursuit for approximately seven minutes, before turning a corner and confronting Dr. Kendra Oliver.>

SCP-6721:

 [COGNITOHAZARD EXPUNGED]?

Dr. Oliver:

 That's right. You remember me! You 

trust

 me. We've been friends for twenty years! Back at 43, remember?

<SCP-6721 backs away, confused, as the pursuing agents close the distance.>

Dr. Oliver:

 You know I wouldn't steer you wrong. Put the gun down.

<SCP-6721 raises the gun, and fires. Dr. Oliver is struck in the leg, and falls to the floor as SCP-6721 resumes its flight.

<Dr. Oliver swings out with her uninjured leg, and SCP-6721 trips. It strikes its chin on the floor as the agents take positions around it.>

<Wilt arrives at the scene, and kicks SCP-6721 in the head. It ceases communication.>

Wilt:

 Get up, Kendra.

<Wilt turns to the agents.>

Wilt:

 Take the subject into custody, then have Chief Ulman run a SCiPnet scan. If anyone else knew this was coming, we need to know about it 

now.

 I want an information security review and probable time to failure ASAP.

Addendum 6721-2, Interrogation:

 The following interrogation was conducted five hours after detainment, once the subject's mental and physical assessment by Chief Medical Officer Dr. Anthony Culp was complete.

SCP-6721 Intake Interview

Date:

 01/03/2023

Officer of Record:

 Dr. Julia Kijek (Director, Area-21)

<Log begins.>

<SCP-6721 and Director Kijek are seated at a table in the former's temporary cell.>

Director Kijek:

 State your name, please, for the record.

SCP-6721:

 I… don't know.

Director Kijek:

 This will go easier for you if you cooperate.

SCP-6721:

 I 

am

 cooperating. I don't… remember my name. I don't know who I am.

Director Kijek:

 Do you know why you're here?

SCP-6721:

 No.

Director Kijek:

 Yes, you do.

<Silence on recording.>

Director Kijek:

 You're here to infiltrate us.

SCP-6721:

 …yes.

Director Kijek:

 Who sent you?

SCP-6721:

 I don't—

Director Kijek:

 You 

do.

 Concentrate. Who sent you?

SCP-6721:

 …the 

giftschreiber.

.

GoI-5054, a society of cryptomancers hostile to Foundation interests.

Director Kijek:

 There you go. And what were you sent here to do?

SCP-6721:

 I…

<SCP-6721 shakes its head.>

SCP-6721:

 …kill you. Kill 

all

 of you. I was sent here to kill everyone. That's what they told me.

Director Kijek:

 Can you remember any details? Specific persons involved? The reasons for this attack? Anything you haven't already told me?

SCP-6721:

 No. There's… there's nothing else.

Director Kijek:

 Let the record show that the subject claims to possess no useful knowledge.

SCP-6721:

 Wait!

Director Kijek:

 Give me a shout if you think of anything, SCP-6721. But please do it quickly.

<Log ends.>

Subsequent to this interview, Director Kijek ordered Dr. Culp to conduct a detailed pharmopsychological workup for SCP-6721. Dr. Culp confirmed that the subject possessed no additional information, and evidenced no medical intervention which could explain its loss of memory. He advised Director Kijek that in his professional opinion, the subject would at no point become a valuable intelligence asset. Security Chief Renata Ulman therefore recommended that the subject be terminated at once.

CONTAINMENT BREACH AAF-1-2022-3, MEDICAL REPORT

Culp, Dr. Anthony (Chief Medical Officer)

12/15/2022

Updated 01/03/2023

On December 14 2022, counterchronological material being processed in Acroamatic Abatement Facility AAF-1 approached critical levels of recondicity.

.

Recondite material cannot be contained within Euclidean geometry.

 Safeguards prevented a full-scale breach scenario, but Director Kijek ordered that all staff report for medical assessment within one day of the event to determine whether any cases of harmful exposure could be found. On December 15 I personally examined every member of staff at Area-21 at my clinic, and determined that no such exposure occurred. However, routine physical workups revealed discrepancies in the biology of two individuals, who were determined to have been exposed to a rare dormant strain of 

SCP-6425

, requiring immediate quarantine.

On January 3 2023, after a lengthy interrogation of captured insurgent SCP-6721, which I oversaw in my capacity as CMO, Director Kijek determined that it was responsible both for releasing the pathogen and precipitating the containment breach. Under my advisement, the Director has therefore ordered Area-21 locked down until further notice.

Case updates will be promptly made available, and I am available to discuss the matter at any time via the SCiPnet messaging system.

She is able, via intense concentration and thaumaturgical stimulus, to observe energy vortices surrounding living subjects. These vortices correspond to vital elements of their personhood and disposition; after two decades of research, Dr. Astrauskas is able to judge the implications of each aura with precision accuracy.

The auras Dr. Astrauskas has identified are as follows:

Mood: a colour gradation between red and violet flowing from the crown of the head to the upper legs, mapping reliably to sixteen distinct emotional states;

Health: a series of discrete emissions from each organ or system, ranging from deep grey to bright white, indicating their relative strength and the presence or absence of sickness or disease;

Intent: a glow in the eye sockets corresponding to the honesty of a subject's statements or their disposition towards the target of their attention;

Identity: a specific and highly detailed fluctuation in a colour which does not map to the known light spectrum, vibrating in unique patterns which allow for the positive or negative identification of individuals the auramancer has already encountered despite disguises, memetic intervention, or behavioural cues.

The extent to which Dr. Astrauskas is capable of perceiving each aura is defined by the state of her other senses. The mood aura produces distinct tastes; the health aura has an olfactory component; the intent aura is audible; the identity aura is tactile, and can be confirmed beyond any shadow of doubt through direct physical contact. When these senses are dulled or disabled, their respective auras are dimmed or made invisible.

Dr. Astrauskas was trained in thaumaturgy at Site-43, and held tenure at Area-21 for many years. In 2003, her auramancy was instrumental in the thwarting of an 

attempted containment breach

 by hostile operatives. She has been involved in multiple research and containment projects since — often in overseas collaboration with her longtime friend and colleague Dr. Udo Okorie, Chief of Applied Occultism at Site-43.

Current Research:

 Dr. Astrauskas is advancing a long-term Level 5 Classified collaborative project with Dr. Lillian Lillihammer; she is presently offsite on a related research sabbatical.

SCP-6721 instance impersonating Junior Researcher Catherine Wilt.

Special Containment Procedures:

 A schedule of all Foundation facilities organized by projected vulnerability to SCP-6721 incursion will be prepared by the Emergent Threat Tactical Response Authority. Auramantic readings of all employees at each facility in descending order of urgency will be carried out as soon as is feasible.

Description:

 SCP-6721 is a group of entities of unknown number who are capable of assuming the identities of extant human individuals, to the point where neither medical science nor most forms of anomalous identity confirmation can detect the irregularity. The effect is at least partially memetic; while a complete bodily transformation is possible, SCP-6721 instances have demonstrated the capacity to convince other individuals in their immediate proximity that they possess identities which diverge substantially from their physical appearance.

Addendum 6721-1, Discovery:

 SCP-6721 was discovered at Area-21 on 01/03/2023 by Foundation thaumaturge Dr. Rozálie Astrauskas. Dr. Astrauskas was on a research sabbatical to various European facilities, seeking consultations for a classified project related to her auramantic capabilities. On entering Area-21, she quickly discovered that the following individuals in the facility's command structure were in fact impersonators:

Director Julia Kijek;

Chief of Security Renata Ulman;

Chief Medical Officer Dr. Anthony Culp;

Senior Researcher Dr. Kendra Oliver;

Junior Researcher Catherine Wilt.

She was able to relay this discovery to two colleagues, Dr. Benjamin Salazar and Agent Heinrich Jacobi, before the SCP-6721 instances orchestrated her capture via Area personnel unaware of their true identities. Dr. Salazar and Agent Jacobi were subsequently neutralized via unknown means. As a containment breach alarm was set during Dr. Astrauskas' flight from security personnel, in order to maintain the illusion of Area-21's compliance with Foundation protocol and deflect outside scrutiny, a tentative SCP file was created describing Dr. Astrauskas as an enemy mole for GoI-5054 (the 

giftschreiber

) and curating the details of her capture to support this contention. Dr. Astrauskas was subjected to memetic reconditioning by Dr. Culp in order to generate a false 'confession' that she had entered Area-21 as a saboteur, which was then appended to her SCP file as an interrogation transcript. Stalling for time to ensure that Dr. Astrauskas had not communicated her suspicions offsite, Area-21 was immediately locked down on the pretence of "ensuring information security and the containment of a potentially lethal pathogen."

Dr. Udo Okorie of 

Site-43

 had already filed a missing persons report on Dr. Astrauskas when she failed to respond to SCiPnet messages after leaving Site-91; as the elapsed time was low and Dr. Astrauskas was on a research sabbatical, this report was not given a high priority. Engaging multiple other staff members to bolster her security clearance level, Dr. Okorie correctly guessed at her friend's destination and remotely accessed A21NET on 01/04/2023. After examining multiple files relating to the unpublished SCP-6721 database entry and identifying multiple discrepancies in the narrative as presented, she alerted the Germanophone Branch and MTF Nu-7 ("Hammer Down") that Area-21 was compromised. While Nu-7 was immediately mobilized, MTF DE-𝔏 ("Die Inquisition") was able to reach the Area within eleven minutes, and after covert infiltration engaged the interlopers.

The SCP-6721 instances impersonating Director Kijek and Junior Researcher Wilt evaded capture and escaped the Area, though wounded. The instance impersonating Chief Ulman committed suicide via cyanide capsule. After barricading themselves in the medical clinic, the instances impersonating Dr. Culp and Dr. Oliver used the medical waste disposal tunnel to enter the Large Solids Liquefaction Chamber in Acroamatic Abatement Facility AAF-1. They then liquefied themselves.

Dr. Astrauskas was released from containment. Memetic deprogramming was successful in restoring her cognition unimpaired, and she was remanded to the medical wing for treatment and interrogation. A transcript is appended below.

Debriefing:

 Dr. Rozálie Astrauskas, Site-91

Date:

 01/04/2023

Officer of Record:

 Acting Director Dr. Njeri Kamau, Area-21

<Log begins.>

<Dr. Astrauskas is lying in a hospital bed. Acting Director Kamau is sitting next to her on a plastic chair.>

Acting Director Kamau:

 I realize you must be very tired, so we will be brief. How did you figure it out?

Dr. Astrauskas:

 I'm an auramancer. I can read, among other things, identity auras. I worked at Area-21 for years; I know most of the people here.

<Dr. Astrauskas suddenly begins to weep.>

Acting Director Kamau:

 You've been through a lot. I understand.

Dr. Astrauskas:

 No, it's not… never… never mind. Ah… I know most of the people here. I… I could tell that… I saw what I expected to see. But I met your boss, Kijek, at an AAG conference a few years back, and Oliver too of course — everyone in AcroAbate knows Oliver. I could tell as soon as I saw them that something was wrong.

Acting Director Kamau:

 With your auramancy?

Dr. Astrauskas:

 Yes, though I couldn't… tell you specifically why, I'm afraid.

Acting Director Kamau:

 I see. So, once you had your suspicions, you contacted a few of your friends?

Dr. Astrauskas:

 Yes. What happened to them? Heinrich and Ben?

Acting Director Kamau:

 They're marked as deceased in the personnel roster. We don't know how. Presumably the insurgents killed them.

<Dr. Astrauskas sighs.>

Dr. Astrauskas:

 And they would have killed me, too, once they knew I hadn't told anyone else, if not for… hmm.

Acting Director Kamau:

 Yes?

Dr. Astrauskas:

 They must have slipped up, right? Who figured that out?

Acting Director Kamau:

 A friend of yours.

Dr. Astrauskas:

 Udo Okorie.

Acting Director Kamau:

 How did you know?

<Dr. Astrauskas smiles.>

Dr. Astrauskas:

 Can I talk to her?

Acting Director Kamau:

 Of course. She's still at 43, because she kept digging while Hammer Down and Die Inquisition were 

en route

, but your SCiPnet messaging permissions have been reinstated.

Dr. Astrauskas:

 Hammer Down was coming?

Acting Director Kamau:

 That's right. They still are, in fact; they'll need to refuel here for the flight home. Dr. Okorie didn't know how badly compromised the Area was, and with the lockdown she assumed the worst.

Dr. Astrauskas:

 I see.

Acting Director Kamau:

 Is there anything else you need to tell me? Did you detect any other insurgents?

Dr. Astrauskas:

 No. No, I think you got them all. Except the ones that got away, I hear.

Acting Director Kamau:

 We'll catch them. I suspect your auramancy will be in high demand in the next few months. That research project you were working on is going to be badly delayed, I'm afraid.

Dr. Astrauskas:

 Mmm.

Acting Director Kamau:

 What was it, if I may ask?

Dr. Astrauskas:

 It's classified, sorry. Call ETTRA and ask, if you're feeling lucky.

Acting Director Kamau:

 I'll pass. Alright, you're going to be held here for observation for twenty-four hours, then released. Quarantine procedure says nobody in or out of this room during that period, but your tablet is on the table there if you want to contact your friend.

Dr. Astrauskas:

 I very much do.

CONTAINMENT BREACH AAF-1-2022-3, MEDICAL REPORT

Culp, Dr. Anthony (Chief Medical Officer)

12/15/2022

Updated 01/03/2023

On December 14 2022, counterchronological material being processed in Acroamatic Abatement Facility AAF-1 approached critical levels of recondicity.

.

Recondite material cannot be contained within Euclidean geometry.

 Safeguards prevented a full-scale breach scenario, but Director Kijek ordered that all staff report for medical assessment within one day of the event to determine whether any cases of harmful exposure could be found.

 

On December 15 I personally examined every member of staff at Area-21 at my clinic, and determined that no such exposure occurred.

 

However, routine physical workups revealed discrepancies in the biology of two individuals, who were determined to have been exposed to a rare dormant strain of SCP-6425, requiring immediate quarantine.

On January 3 2023, after a lengthy interrogation of captured insurgent SCP-6721, which I oversaw in my capacity as CMO, Director Kijek determined that it was responsible both for releasing the pathogen and precipitating the containment breach. Under my advisement, the Director has therefore ordered Area-21 locked down until further notice.

Case updates will be promptly made available, and I am available to discuss the matter at any time via the SCiPnet messaging system.

Provisional security clearance 6721-5 accepted. Access granted. Fetching file.

SCP-6721.

Special Containment Procedures:

 SCP-6721 is an SCP Foundation senior researcher with Security Clearance Level 4 credentials. No restrictions on her person are required. Directives issued by SCP-6721 are backed by the authority of the Emergent Threat Tactical Response Authority.

Description:

 SCP-6721 is Dr. Rozálie Astrauskas, a Level II registered thaumaturge with a speciality in auramancy. Through experimentation with synaesthesia in collaboration with memeticist Dr. Lillian Lillihammer, Dr. Astrauskas has discovered an ability unknown to the present state of anomalous science. By 'crossing the wires' of her senses of smell and touch, and the related auras of 'Health' and 'Identity', she is able to visualize a fifth aura tentatively identified as "Origin." Brief experimentation with extradimensional biological entities transferred from Site-DE6 suggests that this aura pertains to a subject's relationship to baseline reality; individuals from alternate timelines or alternate universes 'read' differently in subtle but recognizable patterns.

Addendum 6721-1, Discovery:

 On 01/03/2023, Dr. Astrauskas demonstrated this new talent by identifying the entire working population of Treatment Area-21 as being of extradimensional origin. Attempts to silence and terminate her after this discovery were thwarted by a combination of her own efforts and those of Dr. Udo Okorie of Site-43, via remote terminal. On 01/04/2023, MTF Nu-7 ("Hammer Down") reclaimed Area-21 by terminating one hundred and twelve interlopers acting in the guise of SCP Foundation employees. The facility's original staff is presumed deceased, their remains subjected to acroamatic abatement processes by their replacements and liquefied in December of 2022.

Analysis of the insurgent cadavers is ongoing. Tentative identification suggests that they represent a formerly unattested sect of GoI-5054 (the 

giftschreiber

), cryptomantic cultists engaged in surreptitious warfare with the SCP Foundation. Their ability to defeat auramantic detection (as it was understood before Dr. Astrauskas developed her new capabilities) may originate from outside of baseline reality, as they do.

Two additional members of staff were terminated by the interlopers after contact with Dr. Astrauskas; review of their personal effects suggests they may have been covertly associated with GoI-6382 (the 

schriftsteller,

) rivals of GoI-5054. Their presumed cryptomantic capabilities would explain why they were not neutralized and replaced until the insurgents were forced to move quickly to avoid exposure.

In recognition of their long service, the extraordinary performances outlined above, and their utility for persecuting the aforementioned conflict with GoI-5054 in the future, both Drs. Astrauskas and Okorie were promoted to Security Clearance Level 4 on 01/05/2023. Dr. Astrauskas has been granted one mandatory week's leave to recuperate before her new duties begin: conducting a schedule of random, unannounced examinations of all Foundation facilities to uncover any further insurgencies, adjunct to 

Operation FIREBREAK

Hello Security Clearance Level 4 Dr. Udo Okorie

Me

Hello Security Clearance Level 4 Dr. Rozalie Astrauskas!

Goofball

You missed the accent on my first name.

Me

Maybe it's a secret distress signal.

Goofball

Aw, are you in distress? Got the "saved the world again" blues have we?

Me

Hey, you saved the world too. You in distress?

Goofball

Kind of? Got a week's leave before reassignment and there's a high probability that I'm spending it in this god damn tomb.

Goofball

Some of these people were my friends.

Me

I know. I don't want to minimize that. But you're not out of friends yet, Roz.

Goofball

Oh yeah, my Canadian girl friends. That's a big help.

Me

How long did it take you to decide whether to put that space in "girl friends"?

Me

Yeah, I wouldn't answer either.

Me

Anyway, who says we're in Canada?

Goofball

What?

Me

Be at the exit in an hour, if you please.

Goofball

Udo Okorie.

Goofball

You're not IN AUSTRIA.

Goofball

Me

I mean, not for long.

Me

Del and I got the week off too. Know what else we got?

Three tickets to Aruba, and you're our third.

Me

Stop crying and text me back you big suck.

Goofball

Fine, but I get to be

Goofball

Adding "also some of those meme maniacs are apparently from another universe" to your dossier has got to be redeemable for an upgrade.

Me

You can negotiate on the plane with Del. She's been itching for a fight for weeks.

Me

Oh, Roz?

Goofball

Yeah?

Me

When Oliver was pretending to be me. I've watched the footage now; you don't squint at her.

Goofball

Right, I didn't.

Me

You always squint when you're reading auras.

Goofball

Yup.

Me

You knew it wasn't me? Without reading the aura?

Goofball

Of course I did, doofus.

Goofball

Magic or no magic, you always know your friends.
