**Item #:** SCP-5029
**Object Class:** Keter
![girl.png](https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-5029/girl.png)
SCP-5029-1/SCP-5029's icon.
**Special Containment Procedures:** Foundation Web Crawler Delta-088 ("HELLO-FRIEND") is to search the web for all mentions of SCP-5029 and download them to a secure hard drive. Upon discovery, all references to SCP-5029 are to be censored. Due to its nature, complete containment of SCP-5029 is not possible at this time.
All devices that were affected by SCP-5029 before Foundation intervention are to be taken into Foundation custody and stored in a safe item storage locker on hall TV-5 of Site-90. The internet servers of Site-90 have been rerouted to prevent SCP-5029 from infecting certain devices and prevent loss of important data.
Devices for the specific purpose of SCP-5029 testing have been set up in a standard technological containment cell on hall CV-17. These devices are not to be removed or used for any purpose outside of experimentation with SCP-5029 unless approved by personnel of 5029/3 clearance.
**Update as of 04/04/2017:** Additional antivirus software is to remain in place to keep SCP-5029 contained within its intended servers. See Addendum-3 for further detail.
**Description:** SCP-5029 is a computer virus that presents itself as a computer application under the name 'Art.png'. SCP-5029 is capable of self-downloading onto devices. SCP-5029 cannot be downloaded from any application stores, and will not appear if searched. SCP-5029 appears unfinished, with many of the application's features remaining unnamed and unfinalized.
SCP-5029-1 refers to a sapient entity within SCP-5029 known as 'girl.png'. SCP-5029-1 will often interact with the features of its application, and will also use the application's features to communicate directly with the subject. In most cases, SCP-5029-1 will begin with the words 'Hello person! do yoo like my art aplicashin?' Responses vary based on how the subject answers it.
![png%20art%20program%20example.png](https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-5029/png%20art%20program%20example.png)  

SCP-5029-1 communicating through SCP-5029.
SCP-5029-1 is believed to be able to view subjects through the screen of the affected device but is unable to hear them. Subjects use SCP-5029 to communicate with SCP-5029-1. Once an SCP-5029-1 instance meets one person, all other SCP-5029-1 instances will retain that information.
Once opened, SCP-5029 cannot be closed until an interaction with SCP-5029-1 is made. After closure, all files and applications on the affected device will revert to an unfinished state. Instances of files and applications being deleted completely have also been noted. Any attempts to restore the damaged data will result in the device shutting down. The device will then reopen after approximately five minutes of being shut off. After restarting, SCP-5029 will be the only accessible feature.
**Addendum-1-Discovery:** SCP-5029 first came to the Foundation's attention when word of a computer virus that can download itself onto devices through unknown means began to spread. By the time of Foundation intervention, SCP-5029 had affected approximately 4,191 devices. Research into ways to undo the damage caused by SCP-5029 is still ongoing.

**SCP-5029-1:** I have lots of answers : D Let me show you how to use aplicashin : )
**Researcher Cherri:** Okay, you can do that.
**Closing statement:** SCP-5029-1 went over the features of SCP-5029 with researcher Cherri for about three minutes, then closed SCP-5029.

**Closing statement:** SCP-5029 closed approximately five seconds after SCP-5029-1's last response.
**Addendum-3-Incident log:**

On 04/04/2017, SCP-5029 began to access servers outside of its intended testing range. Researchers assigned to SCP-5029 were tasked with installing an antivirus software made to combat SCP-5029's anomalous effects. Upon initialization of the antivirus software, the following message was found on one of the SCP-5029 infected devices.
What is this = (
I thawt I was helping D :
I promise I'm not trying to hurt yoo
I'm just trying to help more peeple
SCP-5029 was successfully contained within its intended servers. Additional antiviral software is to remain in place to keep SCP-5029 contained as of 04/04/2017.
**Update as of 04/07/2017:** Researcher Cherri started up his personal laptop, only to discover an SCP-5029 instance downloaded. Unlike other instances of SCP-5029, no other data on the device was damaged. SCP-5029 opened on its own, presenting the following document.
Hey! =D
Sorry about that : / I found out how to help!
Im not a virus now not on this device anyway
Now to do it for every device : D
Researcher Cherri noted that he had installed the antivirus software created by the Foundation. The project to perfect this software and distribute it to all devices at Site-90 is currently ongoing.
