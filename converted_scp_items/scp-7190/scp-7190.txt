Sample of SCP-7190 taken at scene of discovery.

Item #:

 SCP-7190

Object Class:

 Safe

Special Containment Procedures:

 SCP-7190 is stored in a walk-in freezer unit at Site-77. Due to SCP-7190 being in limited supply, researchers wishing to utilize the anomaly must get approval for at least two personnel of Level 3 clearance.

Description:

 SCP-7190 refers to a collection of sushi of varying types and styles. Other than its immunity to spoilage, it is physically non-anomalous.

Subjects that consume SCP-7190 consistently report them to taste highly sweet and tangy, but otherwise palatable, even to individuals who heavily dislike seafood. Analysis shows each instance to contain a wide variety of vitamins

1

 and does not activate allergens of those allergic to shellfish. Documentation, witness testimonies, and thorough experimentation reveals that long term consumption of SCP-7190 will exhibit many beneficial side effects including, but not limited to:

Improved mood;

Improved hair growth;

Weight loss;

Enhanced sexual function;

Moderate growth and enhancement in the mammary gland (in biological females only);

Curing Tourettes and other speech-related disorders;

Curing throat-based cancers and diseases.

Through rigorous testing, it was confirmed SCP-7190 is safe for human consumption, as previous test subjects did not exhibit any ill effects or aliments at any point post-digestion.

Addendum-01, Discovery:

 SCP-7190 was unintentionally discovered through surveillance of the Silverlin family, a known client of 

Marshal Carter & Dark

. Chad Silverlin, the youngest member of the family, made a post on the social networking service 

TikTok

 before it was self-deleted. In the post Chad was enthusiastically describing his experience at Poseidon's Ocean Club

2

, making mention of a 'secret menu' and consuming a plate of SCP-7190.

This initially didn't warrant attention until it was learned other high priority MC&D clients had also frequented the same restaurant, prompting MTF Lambda-14 (“One Star Reviewers”) to raid the establishment after business hours. SCP-7190 and ingredients commonly utilized in anomalous cuisine were found in a hidden compartment in the walk-in freezer. Multiple SCP-7190 instances was confiscated and delivered to Site-77.

After noting SCP-7190's properties, Dr. Manoj drafted a project proposal regarding the object, citing its massive potential the anomaly could bring. Lambda-14 was authorized to collect more SCP-7190 instances following Dr. Manoj's findings.

You military types just can't help being rude and brash all the time, huh? But yes, my team and I have made some substantial discoveries:

Our tests failed to pick up any gustatorial cognitohazards or lingering thaumaturgic influences, meaning it's not being 'enhanced' by artificial means;

SCP-7190 is also natural… for the most part. Most of the ingredients are standard for the dish with the exception of the meat used. Which brings me to my next point;

We as of now, can't identify the meat present in the anomaly. I'm fairly confident it's fish-based but determining the exact species came up with inconclusive results. What's confirmed is that the taste/side effects are directly inherent to the meat itself.

I requested some help from the Cryptozoology Division. I would do the work myself but sadly I'm not a genetic specialist. But the higher ups are definitely pleased with the progress. That's what matters.

 Re: SCP-7190 Findings

Not surprised. I know it's too early to call but I bet you $100 it's those Ambrose 'chefs'. Everyone loves food, and magic can be fun. But combining the two? Sick, risky and perverted. I swear this crap is dripping into the Veil too. You heard those scientists that made meatballs of 

literal

 mammoth meat? Who even comes up with that? Degenerates with too much free time, but I digress.

So they finally approved your side project? Now that's surprising. I know it has some benefits but still.

Some? It can cure cancer! One specific kind of cancer granted but that's not something to gloss over. This is not just another means of cutting food costs like that 

infinite pizza box

 or that 

magical spaghetti pot.

 There's real medical implications here.

Think of it. It can only heal the throat but who knows if that can't extend to the rest of the body if we handle it properly. I'm not saying we should forgo our diet entirely on SCP-7190, albeit that'll actually work. I'm saying that there's potential here that we cannot ignore. I got the greenlight for a reason, Hal.

So what did you get in your end?

Don't remind me. I still don't understand how that got off the ground.

Just had a chat with the manager. She tried playing dumb but it worked well as you expect. Even then she still tried to weasel her way out, claiming 'she was just following orders'. Several of the staff were in on it too. In short, we caught them red-handed.

Addendum-02, Pursuit of Suppliers:

 Although Poseidon's Ocean Club staff were knowledgeable in para-cooking, it was apparent their training was outsourced, and acquired their ingredients from a third party. Captain Bailey authorized the staff to be amnestized of their memory of the raid. The establishment was allowed to conduct its business under the covert surveillance of Lambda-14. This was done not only to identify patrons ordering from the 'secret menu', but to also identify the supplier.

One week later, a nondescript van arrived at the establishment before business hours, delivering boxes of supplies before driving off. Over a period of two days, Lambda-14 remotely tracked the vehicle to ████ ██████, a private stockyard on the coast of ████████, Florida. The shipyard appeared to be operating beyond its official business hours with vans entering and exiting the property at scheduled intervals.

Lambda-14 cut off phone lines then cordoned off the area, quickly subduing and taking control of ████ ██████ with relative ease. Large quantities of SCP-7190 were held at the property alongside unrelated anomalous substances. Undocumented migrant workers and armed mercenaries were captured at the scene with the most prominent being Ivan Frady, the property's owner. Frady refused to cooperate until Captain Bailey took charge of the interrogation.

Frady:

 They claimed their passports were legitimate! I swear I had no idea—

Captain Bailey:

 Mr. Frady, stop wasting my time.

Frady:

 This is l-ludicrous. What am I being charged with?

Captain Bailey:

 Smuggling, conspiracy and violations so grievous it'll make OSHA faint… so far.

Frady:

 So far?! No, no no! You got the wrong idea h-here, pal. I just handle logistics, I'm not—

Captain Bailey:

 Frady… you're in charge. Stop embarrassing yourself—

Frady:

 I'm a pure logistics man, I-I don't handle the cargo! I've just been following standard protocol—

[Captain Bailey massages the bridge of his nose.]

Captain Bailey:

 [Muttering] Every single. Goddamn. Time.

Frady:

 This whole sham you're running is illegal I tell you! I want my lawyer—

[Captain Bailey violently scoots his chair backward, Frady ceases his rambling. Captain Bailey brings a finger to his lip.]

Captain Bailey:

 Shhh…

[Captain Bailey grabs a manila folder from the table and walks around to behind's Frady's seat. Captain Bailey opens the file, sliding out five enlarged photographs on the table.]

Frady:

 What is—

Captain Bailey:

 Shh… Autumn Lagro, Jesse Smith, Naomi Binks, Marco White and Marcus Bowser. Ring a bell, Ivan?

Frady:

 I… No. Never seen these people in my life.

Captain Bailey:

 For good reasons. Now flip the pictures.

Frady:

 Why do—

[Captain Bailey's hands tense around Frady's shoulders, causing the latter to flinch. Captain Bailey brings their mouth to Frady's left ear.]

Captain Bailey:

 Ivan. Flip. The. Pictures.

[Frady shivers immensely, nods and overturns all the photographs; different images are printed on the other side. Frady silently gasps as Captain Bailey gives him a shoulder rub with one hand as he points with the other.]

Captain Bailey:

 Beaten to death outside her daughter's wedding, found inside the trunk of his car with a Colombian necktie, sniped at a motel, the White family disappeared after their house mysteriously burned down, and as for Bowser… hmph, let's say he wasn't going to have kids anytime soon.

[Frady stares at Captain Bailey in horror. The latter shakes his head.]

Captain Bailey:

 Nope. We just stumbled upon the aftermath. And do you know what they all have in common?

Frady:

 [Deep Breathing].

Captain Bailey:

 They had secrets, a neat 

business

 on the side; working with the wrong people, getting up close and personal with things that shouldn't exist. But who cares about the laws of science and when you can make those sweet, sweet Benjamin's. I imagine that goes double for a secret Ambrose Restaurants contractor.

[Captain Bailey places multiple signed documents on the table. Frady curses under his breath. Captain Bailey grips his shoulder tighter.]

Captain Bailey:

 Were you expecting a quick bailout? Sorry to disappoint you, Ivan but that's not how it works. This is a lifetime occupation — no sick days or retirements. To put it bluntly, you're a small fish, working for bigger fish in a pond you can't even imagine. These guys don't tolerate shenanigans, especially when it becomes 

inconvenient

. Even if you don't spill the beans they're going to assume you did… and 

act

 accordingly.

[Frady begins exhibiting signs of a panic attack.]

Frady:

 T-They're a restaurant chain!

Captain Bailey:

 That's connected to a lot of nasty people. I get it, this is a big change, but you need to understand something. Life as you know it is practically already over, Ivan. It's only a matter of time. But if you want to get a good ending after all this, then I suggest you stop playing dumb and start acting smart.

[Captain Bailey walks to the side of the table and stares intensely at Frady. Frady hyperventilates.]

Captain Bailey:

 Ivan. Spill it. This is your last chance.

Frady:

 …And if I talk… I'll get protection?

Captain Bailey:

 Most likely, but you need to impress me first. Let's focus on the sushi you've been stocking and supplying. How's it made?

Frady:

 I don't know.

Captain Bailey:

 

Ivan—

Frady:

 No, really! I don't know! I meant what I said before, I do logistics not production! My job is to organize and coordinate distributions across the country, then count the profits I obtained from those restaurants.

Captain Bailey:

 Restaurants? You mean other than Ambrose?

Frady:

 Well technically they're not all officially restaurants…

Captain Bailey:

 That doesn't make sense. Why would Ambrose allow their products to be served outside their chains? That's money down the drain.

Frady:

 No, they still serve it at their locations. it's just… I've heard they're working out a… special promotion with a… erm… 

major organization

. This organization produces the supplies while Ambrose takes care of the rest. The only reason why this promotion isn't exclusive is because that's part of the contract. These locations are selected out beforehand and I handle a lot of the shipments so everyone becomes happy. This promotion is kind of a big deal.

Captain Bailey:

 And this promotion entails…?

Frady:

 I don't have much details, but I know it's scheduled sometime around May 26, 2023.

Captain Bailey:

 Uh-huh. Why?

Frady:

 They've never said… can I go into witness protection now?

Captain Bailey:

 What did you say the name of this major organization was?

Frady:

 I-I never said.

Captain Bailey:

 Well now's the time.

Frady:

 Look. I-I-I really think I'll feel more comfortable to continue if I got that protection first—

[Captain Bailey slides a photograph of Frady on top of the other photographs. Captain taps silently onto the pile as he stares at Frady, tilting his head.]

[Frady quivers.]

[END LOG]

Addendum-04, Progress:

 According to Frady's testimony, MC&D was Ambrose's primary collaborator and sole supplier of SCP-7190 related materials. Frady provided more documents to prove his statement and most of the mercenaries captured were identified to have definite connections to the organization as well. As determined in Frady's settlement for the Foundation's protection, he was required to expose all known depot locations, request an emergency supply of SCP-7190 from his employers, and allow the Foundation to covertly gain autonomy of the smuggling network to avert suspicion.

Two days later, a submarine emerged from the docking section of the stockyard. Several individuals exited the vessel to be intercepted and arrested by MTF Lambda-14 and Mu-3 (“Highest Bidders”).

3

 This led to the Foundation learning of UE-111789's location.

▷ CLOSE FILE ◁

UE-111789

HISTORY:

 Following the Foundation's failure to interrogate any meaningful information from the operatives, the submarine was searched. Aside from the specific supplies ordered by Ivan Frady, a world map was recovered alongside coordinates to a specific destination in the Atlantic Ocean. This area was explored by Foundation submersibles and designated UE-111789.

LOCATION:

 UE-111789 is a section of seabed located in the Atlantic Ocean; ██°██′██″N ██°██′██″W. A series of man-made structures comprised of bedrock, coral, basalt and scrap metal was found at the scene. Most of these structures were heavily damaged or completely destroyed; Only UE-111789-1 was semi-intact.

UE-111789-1 is a structure located in the middle of UE-111789. It consists of a dozen tall spiraling towers connected by multiple archways. Radiocarbon dating determined it was constructed in the 13th century and is theorized to be a castle as indicated by its medieval architecture. Although a throne room, dungeon room and treasury

4

 was present, it was absent of stairs, ladders and bridges.

Attempts to discern further details of UE-111789 are incredibly difficult due to the large-scale destruction of the ruins.

ARTIFACTS RECOVERED:

Seashells with indecipherable markings scratched on the surface;

Spears constructed from scrap metal and bedrock;

Remnants of a large masculine statue with a beard;

Steel Harpoons;

Torn pieces of netting;

Shrapnel from a torpedo missile;

Bone fragments inconsistent with known aquatic creatures native to those depths.

Eventually, Lambda-14 and Mu-3 was given the order to shut down MC&D's and Ambrose joint network: all known eateries exposed throughout the operation had their SCP-7190's confiscated and all individuals aware of the deal was amnestized or detained. Despite having great success in shutting down the network, production of SCP-7190 still remains in circulation.

 RE: Update

1. 

Temporary

-joint operation.

Our job was to find the delivery points and acquire the sushi and other goodies they had. We upheld our duty, the Bidders still need to uphold theirs. Since Ambrose is backing off Mu-3's leading the charge. We're not completely out of the picture but I don't see us becoming more than a background role.

2. Did you even read the file at all?

The place was near-blown to bits! If there was a magic bullet it's long gone by now. The guys have been squabbling about with their theories all day. It could be a kingdom that magically sunk into Davy Jones's backyard, an alien civilization or MC&D's personal underwater sea world. Pointless conjectures. All that's certain is that it ain't natural and we weren't the first to visit.

The best part is that the castle may not be even relevant to the case! That map had other spots written down on it too but it ended up finding rocks or just plain nothing. It doesn't say on the file but one of those crates on that submarine was filled with treasure (gold, coins, pearls you know the gist). Worst case scenario? The sub might've come back from an unrelated mission and they were called in at the last minute to fill out Frady. It was an emergency restocking, remember? I would hate to think we accidentally wasted needless time and resources on a hunch.

Ugh.

So yeah the operation's foggy but that's life. Was your endeavor just as disappointing as mine?

Addedunm-04, Overhaul:

 Two weeks in the aftermath of the network's dissolution, the Foundation received an anonymous tip who claimed to be a former MC&D member, providing directions to a nondescript fishery operating in the Okinawa region of Japan. Mu-3 and Lambnda-14 were deployed to investigate the address.

Attached below are the results of the deployment.

Foreword:

 All video evidence is taken directly from Captain Bailey's mounted camera.

[BEGIN LOG]

[The camera view is murky and barely visible until Captain Bailey climbs out of the water. He is wearing a scuba suit and carries a water-proofed satchel. Additional MTF members leave the ocean onto the dock. They unzip their satchels and pull out their firearms. Captain Bailey removes the oxygen mask.]

Captain Bailey:

 [Towards Radio.] We're at the infiltration spot. Any activity?

Commander:

 No one has exited the building yet. Alpha team spotted one of the window's lights turning on briefly but nothing more. What do you see on your end?

[Captain Bailey turns his head to the right. All the docks are empty save for one: a speed boat with its engine humming.]

Captain Bailey:

 There's only one boat here. I can see it from and it looks like there's only… two, no four seats max.

Captain Bailey:

 Understood. Proceed with caution. Alpha team will convene with you inside. Over.

Captain Bailey:

 Loud and clear, Command. Over. Alright ladies, you know the drill. Watching your finger on the trigger. The last thing we want is anyone to get excited.

Lambda-14|Samson:

 Stealth on a house made of popsicle sticks? Overkill much?

Captain Bailey:

 'The cornered rat will fight back.' These rich assholes don't take losing very kindly. I won't be surprised if they wired this place to blow at a hair's breadth…

[Lambnda-14 physically tenses up. Captain Bailey.]

Captain Bailey:

 Hyperbolically speaking. There's no way they'll blow this place this close to a population center.

Lambda-14|Yonda:

 Can we get inside already? I'm freezing my ass out here.

Captain Bailey:

 Right then. Ladies' first.

[Lambda-14 silently traverses the docks and approaches the fishery. They find the emergency exit but it is locked. Lambda-14|Yonda kneels and picklocks the door. It opens — all operatives enter inside and turn on their night goggles. They are situated inside a room with conveyor belts; several corridors are visible at the end of the room.]

Lambda-14|Sullivan:

 [Whisper] Still clear… where to?

Captain Bailey:

 We need to spit up — cover more ground efficiently as possible. Don't drag your feet—

[Shouting followed by gunshots echo from the right-most corridor. By the sound of the gunshots a shotgun and machine guns are being used. Lambda-14 are startled.]

Lambda-14|Samson:

 That soon?!

Captain Bailey:

 Bidder's got lucky yet again? Let's give them a helping hand— go go! I said don't drag your feet!

[Lambda-14 rush into the corridor, they take several turns until reaching a larger hallway. Two armed men are engaging in a firefight with Mu-3 operatives. the latter taking cover behind the wall corner's. Lambda-14 meets them behind. The two men turn around shouting in Japanese before being gunned down by Captain Bailey. The corridor becomes silent.]

Captain Bailey:

 [Heavy Panting.] …Man… that was… [More Panting] anticlimactic. Care to explain?

[Captain Bailey lowers his machine gun. Four bodies litter the hallway, bleeding across the floor. Mu-3 begins to leave cover and reconvene with Lambda-14.]

Mu-3|Captain Maxwell:

 Don't look at us! Everything was fine and dandy until these two dimwits tried to ambush us! Then another two tried to get clever and… you know the rest.

Captain Bailey:

 Shit.

Mu-3|Captain Maxwell:

 But! But, we've searched a lot of the building on our end. Command says outside is the same. I think that's all of them?

Lambda-14|Yonda:

 Really? It can't be that easy. Isn't this where they make the sushi? This is the crown of their network.

Mu-3|Marrick:

 Nah, more like 

was

. Like our captain said, this place is practically cleared out. Not much on the beds, not much in the kitchen either. These are literally the only hostiles we encountered. This is too big for just four people.

Captain Bailey:

 …Heh… right on the money, kid. Those greedy pigs must have caught wind we were coming. Empty kitchens and bedrooms. These aren't the real perps, or at least the ones the matter. They're the clean-up crew. Tying up loose ends. Someone update Command.

Lambda-14|Sullivian:

 Ah damn, so we're too late then? What were they 

cleaning

 up?

Captain Bailey:

 …Where exactly did they ambush you from?

Lambda-14|Samson:

 Over here Cap'. Mind the foam!

[Samson calls from a doorway to the right. A hissing sound is heard, prompting the MTF's to enter the room. The room consists of tiled walls, ceiling and floor with a small area section off and depressed lower in the ground with a drain and retractable shower head installed. Samson has turned on the shower head, spraying water into a smoking trash can.]

Lambda-14|Yonda:

 Sam?! Stop! What are you—

Captain Bailey:

 Hold on Yonda. Was that on fire earlier?

Lambda-14|Samson:

 Bet your ass, Cap'! [Turns off shower head] That's a bunch of paper here. I guess their paper shredder went out of commission?

Mu-3|Captain Maxwell:

 So they 

were

 cleaning evidence… what do you see inside? Is the evidence still intact, son?

Lambda-14|Samson:

 I'm looking, I'm looking! It's… very messy here. Seems like some food and other trash is mixed in too

5

 … wait! I see a bit of paper that's kind of dry. A note… there's something written on it.

Lambda-14|Yonda:

 And?

Lambda-14|Samson:

 I… I can't make heads or tales of it. It's like an entirely different language.

[Captain Bailey takes and scans the letter; it is written in cursive English. Captain Bailey rolls their eyes and enunciates clearly.]

Captain Bailey:

 "Dear…" Can't read this part. "The promotion for May has been scrapped. According to public sources, the Disney remake's a flop. We will carry forth on a different…" The rest is burnt off.

Mu-3|Albert:

 Remake? What remake?

Captain Bailey

 For a promotion on… May 26… hm?

[Captain Bailey examines the drain more closely. Jewelry and a broken trident lay inside. Captain Bailey reaches in and pulls out a makeshift necklace consisting of rocks and a clam shell.]

Captain Bailey:

 …No… what?

[Captain Maxwell spots a freezer door on the opposite wall. He signals the present MTF members and opens the door. It is dark inside. They are immediately assaulted by a noxious smell. Captain Bailey gags but turns on his flashlight and enters. The rest of the MTF follow his example.]

[They are inside a walk-in freezer. Wooden crates and metallic instruments are laid haphazardly on the floor. Captain Bailey peers inside a crate without a lid; rows of meat and nori sealed in air-tight packages. Captain Bailey shines his light over several overturned gas canisters.]

Captain Bailey:

 It's not cold in here… were they trying to burn the entire building down—

[Captain Bailey freezes. In front of him are multiple large fish carcasses hung from the ceiling by meat hooks. The tail is left relatively unharmed while the upper-half is completely absent of skin; the head and limbs are missing, leaving only the ribcage. The floor is stained with blood.]

Lambda-14|Samson:

 Jesus, they were cutting up tuna in here?

Captain Bailey:

 …That's not tuna. The tail's too scaly and the ribcage is not right. It almost looks… like a monkey.

Lambda-14|Samson:

 A monkey? How on earth did you come with that idea? Cap'? Captain. Captain! Where ya going?

[Captain Bailey leaves the freezer and returns with the stringed clam necklace. Captain Bailey hangs the necklace from his finger below the carcasses' ribcage.]

Captain Bailey:

 No… no…

[Captain Bailey spots a portable incinerator in the room. He quickly walks to it and turns it off. He then takes a nearby fire extinguisher and puts out the fire inside. He freezes. Human bones and hair are visible inside.]

Captain Bailey:

 Oh… oh… no—

[Captain Bailey slips backwards and falls on his back. Two MTF members come to his aid and lift him into a sitting position. Captain Bailey shines his flashlight on the object he slipped on. He gasps. A disembodied feminine hand lays on the floor. Manipulating his flashlight, it is revealed that the floor is covered sporadically in pieces of flesh. A soft cough emanates from the corner. Captain Bailey directs his flashlight, readying his firearm.]

[The light illuminates a large fish tank. Inside the tank is an entity consisting of the top half of a human female and the bottom half of a fish tail-like appendage. The water in the tank is half empty, frozen and just beginning to thaw. The entity is pale, its eyes are rolled up, and is breathing shallowly. It is missing its right forearm.]

[Several MTF members begin to gag, exclaim curse words or vomit. Captain Bailey quickly eyes the hanging fish tails, the crates, and finally the entity before tensing up. Captain Bailey is heaving, struggling excessively not to vomit as he looks away. Captain Bailey pauses for ten seconds.]

Captain Bailey:

 [Prolonged Pause] Jesus Christ!
