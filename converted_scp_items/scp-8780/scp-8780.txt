MEETING 8870-D

DATE:

 03/05/2025

LOCATION:

 [REDACTED]

FOREWORD:

 Meeting of personnel in GREY MATTER Division. Led by Dr. Hakari Mimko.

[BEGIN RECORDING]

 

<The members of the GREY MATTER Division sit at a conference table. Senior Technician Dohn Cavollo and Dr. Laura Schneider sit next to each other, utterly silent.>

<The last member and lead, Dr. Hakari Mimko, sits at the head of the table. She sits in a wheelchair, looking out onto the scenery.>

<The trees outside are leaveless, morning dew still dripping from some branches.>

<After a while, Dr. Mimko sighs, turns the wheelchair to face the others, and folds her arms on the table.>

 

MIMKO:

 Glad you could come. I’m sure you’re already aware.

 

<A long silence. Dr. Mimko retrieves files from under her chair and deposits them onto the table. The files are detailed files on 

Dr. Alto Clef

.>

 

MIMKO:

 O5-11 

was

 

SCP-8870

. Agent Duvall suspected me, 

rest his soul

, and when O5-11 saw our little struggle, he tried to swat both flies in one go.

MIMKO:

 Then he killed himself. Whether voluntary or not, the coroner’s suspect that O5-11 saw his own reflection in the screen he was overwatching us from, and subsequently killed himself.

 

<Silence. The others shift uncomfortably in their seats.>

 

SCHNEIDER:

 So the case is done?

MIMKO:

 They’re searching for possible accomplices. But our involvement with the anomaly is long done.

CAVOLLO:

 I can’t believe 11 was 8870. Why?

MIMKO:

 Well, 

(clears throat)

 I suspect that he saw the division as an opportunity to take down both the Foundation and the Coalition to gain custody of his 

daughter

. This seems to be the most likely case at this moment.

SCHNEIDER:

 So the division’s done?

MIMKO:

 

(pauses)

 I’m afraid so.

CAVOLLO:

 Now what? We’re unemployed now?

MIMKO:

 You’ll receive your transfer notices in due time.

 

<Silence.>

 

SCHNEIDER:

 And what about you?

MIMKO:

 What about me?

CAVOLLO:

 In your little project proposal, you said you were doing this for your siste—

MIMKO:

 That is not relevant to the discussion at hand, Mr. Cavollo. 

(looks at Schneider)

 The same goes for you, Dr. Schneider.

 

<They look at each other with a stern expression for quite more time. Eventually, Cavollo and Schneider leave without a word or without turning back.>

<Once the others have left, tears begin streaming from Dr. Mimko’s eyes, which she silently wipes away. She sniffles. She puts her head in her hands and begins sobbing uncontrollably.>

 

MIMKO:

 

(sobs) I’m sorry, Tomo. I’m sorry.

 

<She remains like this for quite a while.>

SCP-8780 appeared on 04/07/2025. Further information is in the following appendix.

 

APPENDIX [8780-002]

 

INCIDENT 8780-α

DATE:

 04/07/2025

LOCATION:

 Oberhausen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany

FOREWORD:

 On the above mentioned date, SCP-8780 appeared within the Westfield Centro shopping mall, completely naked. Local authorities were dispatched to the scene to apprehend the subject, but called in the Foundation when the subject began emitting a faint orange glow from within its chest.

Evacuation procedures on the location were enacted. A detachment of the Foundation’s 

German branch

 was sent in to handle the threat; Mobile Task Force Delta-2 (”Dachshunde”).

The transcript has been translated from its original German.

[BEGIN RECORDING]

 

<Members of MTF Delta-2 converge around SCP-8780’s location. They remain positioned at various vantage points to be in direct shooting range of the subject, hidden from view.>

<Captain of Delta-2, Henning Waggner, methodically approaches SCP-8780, unarmed. The subject notices and snaps to look at him.>

 

8780:

 Oh— oh, my God.

WAGGNER:

 

(calm)

 Relax, man. What’s going on?

8780:

 I— I— I— 

(hyperventilates)

 

<An orange glow begins to be emitted from the interior of the subject’s chest. Its skin turns translucent; indistinct cuboid objects can be observed ’swimming’ inside.>

<The subject winces, screaming loudly, clutching their chest tightly.>

<After some time, the glow dissipates. The subject gasps for air.>

 

WAGGNER:

 Woah! Take it slow. Deep breaths in and out.

8780:

 

(sobs)

 Help me, please… Help me!

WAGGNER:

 I am. I can help you. Come with me, I’ve got friends who can fix t—

 

<The glow returns, shining at a greater luminescence this time. The subject falls to his feet collapsing onto the floor.>

 

8780:

 

(strains)

 Tell Anna… t—tell her that I’m sorry…

 

<The glow only greatens in luminescence by the second. A rise in surrounding temperature is being recorded by Captain Waggner’s equipment.>

 

8780:

 I’m sorry…

 

<Rises in both luminescence and temperature do not cease.>

<Waggner motions for Müller to take the shot. Müller, situated at the rooftop, takes the shot. The bullet bounces back on the subject’s skin, leaving no mark.>

 

8780:

 

(gasps) Tell her I’m s—

 

<Footage abruptly cuts here. Last frame is that of a large fireball being emitted from SCP-8780’s person.>

 

[END RECORDING]

The Westfield Centro shopping mall was engulfed in a large explosion, completely destroying the structure and the surrounding area in a kilometer radius.

Due to the enacted evacuation procedures, total casualty count was minimal, with a majority of the casualties being the 4 members of MTF Delta-2 and SCP-8780 itself.

TERROR BEFALLS GERMANY

ANOMALY DESTROYS GIANT MALL

Oberhausen - North Rhine-Westphalia -

 TERROR! Sprawling city Oberhausen’s greatest shopping mall was torn apart by the largest explosion to hit Germany, ever since the second WORLD WAR. People are left in utter fear, as they look onto a crater of where their favorite shopping and hang-out place formerly stood.

 

Rumors are circulating that this act of DEATH & DESTRUCTION was a deliberate terrorist attack. With the perpetrator identified as an African-American, restrictions on immigrant laws have yet again become a heated topic in the 

Bundestag

. ”We have said it again and again. We cannot let […] foreigners into our beloved country!” voices Tino Chrupalla, representative of the 

Alternative für Deutschland

 political party.

 

Lead of investigations, Director Karl Reinhardt of the SCP Foundation, has been cleared to conduct an interview on a later

RECORDING 8780-001

DATE:

LOCATION:

 Mainz, Rhineland-Palatinate

FOREWORD:

 The following is the meeting of Karl Reinhardt, director of the Foundation’s German branch, with news outlet ZDF after Incident 8780-α.

[BEGIN RECORDING]

 

<Skip to 2 minutes, 42 seconds.>

<Director Reinhardt and a reporter sit in two chairs, facing each other. Director Reinhardt has his legs crossed over each other and his hands folded.>

 

REPORTER:

 … which brings us to the most heated question.

REINHARDT:

 Yup.

REPORTER:

 What happened there in Oberhausen? And most importantly, was it a terrorist, as many people have claimed?

REINHARDT:

 Okay, so, first of all, what happened in Oberhausen was an explosive anomaly that leveled the entire mall. As to whether the person was a terrorist, investigations into this are uncertain as of right now—

REPORTER:

 But you are the lead of investigations, right?

REINHARDT:

 … yes?

REPORTER:

 Then why haven’t your people figured it out yet? For all the citizens know, this might happen again in another shopping mall. Maybe even in the heads of senate in Berlin!

REINHARDT:

 Well, the Foundation is doing the best it can to identify the origins of the subject and protect the citizens—

REPORTER:

 You call a giant explosion that left a one kilometer crater protection?

REINHARDT:

 Of course not—

REPORTER:

 How is the public supposed to feel safe when you call 

this

 protection?

TRANSFER REQUEST

DATE:

SUBJECT:

 Request of Transfer to SCP-8780

SUBMITTED BY:

 Dr. Hakari Mimko

 

Dear O5-Council,

I’d hereby like to request the transfer of my current menial records archivist assignment to lead researcher of investigations into SCP-8780.

With my expertise leading a division and my indirect ’detainment’ of such a dangerous threat to the Foundation as SCP-8870, I think I’d be more than capable of handling these investigations.

I know that my past actions have not been honest, and I’d sincerely apologize for my dishonesty. I do hope you forgive me and that we can set aside the past to venture into the future.

MEETING 8780-A

DATE:

LOCATION:

 [REDACTED]

[BEGIN RECORDING]

 

<Dr. Mimko opens the door to her office. The interior is dark. She turns the lights on.>

<The office’s interior is small, almost claustrophobic. It is furnished with only the most necessary of objects; a chair, desk, bed, bookshelf and potted plant.>

<Next to the framed image of Tomo Mimko on the desk rests a pamphlet. She examines it closer; it is a notice of her successful transfer.>

<Dr. Mimko sighs, pressing the pamphlet against her chest. A slow clapping emanates from a corner of the office. Mimko tenses up immediately, shooting her head to the source of the sound.>

 

O5-13:

 

(slow claps)

 Bravado, Dr. Mimko! Bravo!

 

<O5-13 approaches Mimko from the corner of the room. Dr. Mimko remains wary.>

 

MIMKO:

 Sophia Light…

O5-13:

 

(gestures to herself)

 In the flesh.

MIMKO:

 What are you doing here?

O5-13:

 

(smiles)

 Can’t a supervisor congratulate their dear colleague to their transfer?

 

<O5-13 sits down beside Mimko on the desk. Mimko inhales greatly.>

 

MIMKO:

 Is there anything I could do for you?

O5-13:

 Oh, don’t be like that! Relax! I may be an Overseer 

and

 your supervisor in the 8780 investigations, but I’m still human!

 

<O5-13 smiles. Dr. Mimko attempts to smile back.>

 

O5-13:

 Oh, I wanted to say sorry.

MIMKO:

 

(silence)

O5-13:

 For what happened to Duvall. And Clef.

 

<Mimko tenses up.>

 

O5-13:

 No one could’ve seen that coming. You know, Clef and me go all the way back to the 

Omega-7

 days.

MIMKO:

 … really?

O5-13:

 Yep! Treated 

Iris

 like she were his own daughter! With all the restrictions keeping him from his 

real

 one.

 

<Silence. O5-13 and Dr. Mimko stare each other deep in the eyes.>

 

O5-13:

 

(sighs)

 It’s a shame that a daughter has to grow up without her father. You wanna know what the last thing he said to me was?

MIMKO:

 

(silence)

O5-13:

 Nothing. Well, not literally ’nothing’, but, nothing. He called me the day he committed suicide, or saw his own reflection, or whatever, and didn’t say a word. At first I thought the connection went dead, but, no, I could clearly hear his gasps for air, as he impacted the terminal and collapsed onto the floor. Probably in the processes of bleeding out to death.

O5-13:

 One must wonder… why? Why call me? Why call 

me

? What was the reason?

 

<O5-13 turns to look at Dr. Mimko. Dr. Mimko does not falter in her stance, looking back at her.>

 

MIMKO:

 One must wonder.

 

<O5-13 smiles.>

 

O5-13:

 Well, I came to say hi, so, hi. I expect great things from you.

 

<O5-13 pats Dr. Mimko on the shoulder, before opening the door and closing it behind her.>

<Once it is closed, Dr. Mimko lets out a long exhale. She clutches the pamphlet tightly.>

LOCATION:

 [CLASSIFIED PER ETHICS COMMITTEE]

INTERVIEWER:

 Dr. Hakari Mimko

INTERVIEWED:

 Anna Hetting

FOREWORD:

 Analysis of the footage of Incident 8780-α identified SCP-8780 as Mr. Benjamin Hetting. Derived from statements by the subject, Anna Hetting, the wife, was located. An interview was arranged shortly afterward.

The interview has been translated from its original German.

[BEGIN RECORDING]

 

<Dr. Mimko arrives at Anna Hetting’s residence. She inspects the area, before exiting the car and approaching the front door.>

<She is walking with crutches, nearly falling over on multiple occasions.>

<As she arrives at the front door, a figure is seen staring at Dr. Mimko, before walking by the curtains. Before she can ring the doorbell, the door is opened from the inside. Anna Hetting is on the other side.>

<She does not look Dr. Mimko in the eyes.>

 

MIMKO:

 Mrs. Hetting?

HETTING:

 Foundation, right? 

(sniffles)

MIMKO:

 Dr. Mimko. I’d like to ask you a few questions about your husband, then I’ll be gone.

HETTING:

 

(silence)

MIMKO:

 May I come in?

 

<Hetting remains completely silent, staring at the floor. She moves inside, to which Dr. Mimko also goes inside.>

<The interior of the house is small, but well-furbished and cozy. Hetting sits down at a chair, stiffly. Dr. Mimko sits down opposite her.>

 

MIMKO:

 

(looks around)

 Very nice decorations you have here.

HETTING:

 

(pauses)

 Thanks.

MIMKO:

 And the furnitu—

HETTING:

 P—please. Please…

 

<She looks Dr. Mimko directly in the eyes. Tears begin to well up. Dr. Mimko clears her throat, straightens her posture and moves on.>

 

MIMKO:

 When was the last time you saw your husband?

HETTING:

 About… two weeks ago.

MIMKO:

 Where?

HETTING:

 H—he went out with Jupiter — our dog — for a late night’s stroll.

MIMKO:

 Do you know what route he took?

HETTING:

 N—no.

MIMKO:

 And you reported his disappearance to the police?

HETTING:

 I did. I did. They couldn’t find him, didn’t know where h—he went. Until… 

(pauses)

MIMKO:

 Did he seem strange to you before his disappearance?

HETTING:

 Strange? 

(chuckles weakly)

 No. Not at all. I mean, he was strange, but not strange

r

 than usual, no.

 

<Dr. Mimko inscribes the information on a notepad. Hetting fiddles around with her fingers.>

<Dr. Mimko finishes her notes.>

 

MIMKO:

 That’d be all, Mrs. Hetting. Thank you for your time.

 

<Hetting does not respond. Dr. Mimko stands up to leave.>

 

MIMKO:

 And, Mrs. Hetting, I am sorry for your los—

HETTING:

 

(raises hand)

 Please… j—just leave…

 

<Hetting begins to silently tear up. Dr. Mimko nods, turns away and exits the residence.>

AUTOPSY REPORT #8780

DATE:

 04/15/2025

LOCATION:

 Mortuary, Site-DE-54

FOREWORD:

 A sweep of the former site of the Westfield Centro mall was performed, whereupon remains of SCP-8780 were recovered. Remains were sent in for autopsy, where the coroner subsequently contacted the SCP-8780 investigations lead.

[BEGIN RECORDING]

 

<Dr. Mimko enters the mortuary. The giant door heaves shut behind her, as she turns her eyes forward. On a table, Coroner Gustav Jörgen operates on the remains of SCP-8780.>

<He is holding an operation tool in one hand, and in the other a ham-chicken sandwich. Upon noticing Dr. Mimko, he hurriedly puts his sandwich aside, nearly choking.>

 

JÖRGEN:

 

(full mouth)

 Mhm— Doc Mimko! I thought the meet— 

(coughs loudly)

 I thought the meeting was supposed to be at six?

MIMKO:

 Change of schedule. What did you find?

JÖRGEN:

 Of course, of course! Come here!

 

<Jörgen gestures for Mimko to come over.>

<What remains of SCP-8780 are patches of loose skin, flesh and bone fragments, with most of them being severely charred. Of note is the presence of four metallic cuboid objects of various sizes. Mimko eyes the objects extensively.>

 

MIMKO:

 What are these?

JÖRGEN:

 

(gulps down sandwich)

 What, those? Let me show you!

 

<Coroner Jörgen hurries over TLA Model #3465,

1

 and prepares it. A low hum, increasing in frequency, becomes audible.>

 

JÖRGEN:

 This’ll blow your mind! By the way, I’d just step away a few meters. Just saying.

 

<The TLA finishes charging up and shoots a projectile at one of the cuboid objects. Dr. Mimko shields her eyes. Once the TLA decharges again, she looks back onto the cube.>

<The cube emits a faint blue glow, which eventually dissipates. Temperature recording equipment does not indicate a change in temperature. Jörgen grins widely.>

 

JÖRGEN:

 You know what that is?

MIMKO:

 

(under breath)

 Beryllium bronze.

JÖRGEN:

 Exactly!

MIMKO:

 But, why?

JÖRGEN:

 The bronze is used to enhance magical spells and abilities; whatever happened to this guy, magicks were definitely involved.

MIMKO:

 Any leads to where the bronze might’ve come from?

JÖRGEN:

 Sadly not, though it’s suspected to have originated in Germany. 

MC&D

 controls all shipping of anomalous materials. With us covering their butts for their 2023 scandal, I doubt they’d be willing to break that partnership.

 

<Jörgen retrieves another ham-chicken sandwich from a nearby tray.>

 

JÖRGEN:

 I am so excited! 

(takes bite)

 Sorry, I eat a lot when I’m excited. And when I’m performing autopsies. I actually think it’s a coping mechanism.

MIMKO:

 But where would there be beryllium bronze deposits? And who would… 

(trails off)

 

<Dr. Mimko quickly turns around and exits the mortuary.>

 

JÖRGEN:

 

(full mouth)

 You can thank me later! I guess. 

(takes bite)

APPENDIX [8780-008]

 

INTERVIEW 8780.02

DATE:

 04/17/2025

LOCATION:

 [CLASSIFIED PER ETHICS COMMITTEE]

FOREWORD:

 Due to the presence of anomalous material beryllium bronze within SCP-8780, contact was established with an individual knowledgable on the topic.

[BEGIN RECORDING]

 

<Dr. Mimko arrives via helicopter to the site. The area is a farm, with a barn and a small house next to it. An indistinct figure is seen watching the helicopter from the front porch.>

View taken from body-cam.

<The helicopter lands. Mimko exits the craft. The figure slowly approaches.>

<As the figure approaches, all plant-life in its vicinity begins to wither and quickly die out. Dr. Mimko stops a few meters away from the figure.>

 

MIMKO:

 

(holds out hand)

 The biblical 

Cain

, I presume?

 

<SCP-073 does not shake Mimko’s hand. She lowers her arm.>

 

073:

 Did he break out?

MIMKO:

 No worries, Mr. Cain. Your brother’s still sleeping tight 200 meters below sea level.

073:

 

(pauses)

 Then you have come to take me?

MIMKO:

 

(chuckles)

 I can assure you, there is nothing to worry about.

 

<SCP-073 approaches Dr. Mimko. Security escorts at the helicopter raise their weapons, before lowering them again.>

 

MIMKO:

 I’m just here to ask a few questions about your limbs. Specifically the material that they’re made out of.

 

<SCP-073 looks down at its arms and legs.>

 

073:

 What of them?

MIMKO:

 You’ve given us detailed information about beryllium bronze deposits all over the world; we’re wondering if you know of more, yet unmentioned deposits in Germany.

073:

 And help you create engines of war and slaughter? No, thank you.

 

<SCP-073 turns away.>

 

MIMKO:

 

(shouts)

 Your cooperation would be helpful!

 

<SCP-073 stops dead in its tracks. It turns back to look at Mimko.>

 

073:

 Did you know terrorist attacks rose when the Veil broke? When the public first gazed into the darkness?

MIMKO:

 Yes.

073:

 Do you know… why?

MIMKO:

 A rise in raids on Foundation installations occurred worldwide. They grabbed whatever they could get their hands on and turn them into weapons.

073:

 No— yes. But that’s not what I meant.

 

<Silence.>

 

073:

 When people first found out about me, they rejoiced. I was happy… but then man did what it could do best. 

Kill.

073:

 They killed in the name of their religion. In the name of 

me

. Thousands of innocents died. Why? Because I restored a little faith in the world.

 

<Silence.>

 

073:

 That’s why I 

cannot

 help you. You pride yourselves of being the shining light in the darkness, but all you are are scared little men and women, who’d do anything to prove that you aren’t. I’m sorry.

 

<SCP-073 walks back to its house.>

 

MIMKO:

 … there was an explosion. At a mall.

 

<SCP-073 stops. He looks at Dr. Mimko.>

 

MIMKO:

 Only 5 people died, but still. We don’t know who caused it, or if it will happen again. For all we know, it won’t. For all we know, it might strike at an airport next — we do not know.

MIMKO:

 That’s why we — 

I

 — need your help. For innocents’ lives. I… had a sister once. Tomo was her name. She died. An innocent’s life flushed down the drain. I don’t want it to happen again. 

For anybody.

 

<There is a slight tremor in SCP-073’s expression, in its stance. Dr. Mimko looks at SCP-073 intently.>

 

073:

 [COORDINATES REDACTED]. There. Another deposit of beryllium bronze, untouched by anybody. Until now.

MIMKO:

 Thank you, Cain.

 

<SCP-073 remains silent.>

<After a few seconds, Dr. Mimko returns to and boards the helicopter. The helicopter takes off. SCP-073 looks on at the craft.>

<As the craft leaves the area, SCP-073 can be seen tending to some sheep in the distance.>

MISSION LOG 8780-α

DATE:

 04/22/2025

LOCATION:

 [REDACTED]

FOREWORD:

 With the coordinates given by SCP-073, an MTF detachment of the German branch was dispatched to the location; Mobile Task Force Lambda-9 (”Nacktmulle”).

The members are λ9-1 | CAP, λ9-2 | KUN, λ9-3 | WOLF; Dr. Hakari Mimko is stationed at the command center.

[BEGIN RECORDING]

 

<MTF λ-9 arrives at an abandoned manufacturing plant. The sky is cloudy, with various crows cackling in the distance. They approach the large gate into the interior.>

<Inside, they turn their head-mounted flashlights on. They begin carefully surveying the area.>

Shot from λ-9 team.

 

MIMKO:

 Contact me at the earliest sign of anything suspicious.

λ9-1 | CAP:

 Got it.

λ9-2 | KUN:

 Yep.

λ9-3 | WOLF:

 Aye, aye.

 

<The team proceeds further into the complex. What little of the outside light shone in, it is gone now.>

 

λ9-3 | WOLF:

 Found a hatch!

 

<MTF λ-9 converges around a floor-mounted hatch. It is severely rusted and wide open. A hallway is being dimly illuminated down there.>

 

λ9-2 | KUN:

 I see a light down there…

λ9-1 | CAP:

 Command, permission to venture down?

MIMKO:

 Permission given. Proceed with caution.

 

<The team ventures down into the hatch.>

<They arrive in a narrow hallway. The walls are heavily withered, with equally as rusted pipes aligning the walls. There is a overhead lightbulb dimly illuminating the area around it. Faint dripping can be heard.>

<The team continues down more corridors. On multiple occasions, they stumble upon doors with newly attached plaques on the frame, the words indescribable. These doors are locked.>

<λ-9 arrives at an open door, which they enter.>

<The room appears to be some sort of security station, with old monitors stacked up against a wall. There is a table and knocked-over swivel chair at the far end of it. Various documents litter the table and the area surrounding it.>

<λ9-1 | CAP inspects these documents.>

 

λ9-1 | CAP:

 

(reads)

 ’… vitals appear to be stable…’, ’… 2 kilograms of beryllium bronze…’, ’SC-07534/844/9870…’ Command, we got any group that uses this classification scheme?

λ9-2 | KUN:

 That’s the 

Insurgency

.

 

<The members of λ-9 begin to pay close attention to their surroundings.>

 

λ9-3 | WOLF:

 Fucking hell…

MIMKO:

 Captain, scan these documents. Then get out ASAP.

λ9-1 | CAP:

 Already on it.

 

<λ9-1 | CAP scans all documents as quickly as he can. He stumbles upon one document,

 [COGNITOHAZARD EXPUNGED]

.>

<He is silent for a while. The others become confused and come to his side.>

 

λ9-3 | WOLF:

 Thomas! You okay…

λ9-2 | KUN:

 Holy shit…

λ9-1 | CAP:

 You seeing this, Command?

MIMKO:

 Affirmative. Transmitted data has already been archived.

λ9-2 | KUN:

 That can’t be—

λ9-3 | WOLF:

 You hear somethi—

 

<A figure steps into view, standing at the door. The figure is a young boy, heavily bruised and malnourished.

2

>

<λ-9 keep distance from the boy.>

 

λ9-2 | KUN:

 

(calm)

 Hey, young boy. Can we help you?

BOY:

 

(sobs) M—meine Mama…

λ9-2 | KUN:

 

(shushes) Du möchtest deine Mama wiedersehen? Wir können dir helfe—

 

<A faint orange glow is being emitted by the boy. He clutches his chest tightly.>

 

λ9-1 | CAP:

 Kun…

λ9-2 | KUN:

 

Du möchtest doch deine Mama wiedersehen, oder?

BOY:

 

(nods)

λ9-2 | KUN:

 

Dann lass uns vorbei. Dann können wir—

 

<The orange glow increases in luminosity. The boy screams in pain.>

<A large fireball is being emitted by the boy. Footage cuts out.>

 

[END RECORDING]

The entire underground portion of the area collapsed in on itself within a hundred meter radius. Above ground portions of the manufacturing plant collapsed into the resultant sinkhole.

Total amount of casualties were 4. The data transmitted by MTF λ-9 Captain Thomas Meier was received by Command without issue.

<Dr. Mimko is sorting through some files related to the case.>

<Suddenly, the office door swings open. O5-13 stampedes inside, documents in hand. Mimko does not stop her ministrations.>

<O5-13 stops right in front of her desk.>

 

O5-13:

 What is this?

MIMKO:

 What is what?

 

<O5-13 deposits the documents on the desk.>

 

O5-13:

 Why are there redacted portions in the mission log I can’t see?

MIMKO:

 Cognitohazards. You know the gist.

O5-13:

 

Bullshit.

MIMKO:

 It’s true.

 

<O5-13 pounds her fist on the desk. She leans in her face so much, they are almost touching.>

 

O5-13:

 If it were up to me, you’d be long gone. Holed up in a room, lying in a ditch somewhere. I 

know

 what you did, Dr. Mimko. I know it.

 

<They stare at each other for quite a while.>

 

MIMKO:

 I think it’s time you’ve gotten some fresh air.

 

<She scoffs, before moving toward the door. She stops at the door.>

 

O5-13:

 Clef wasn’t the greatest person, far from it. But at least he had a 

heart

.

 

<O5-13 exits the room. Dr. Mimko looks on aimlessly, before sorting through files again.>

APPENDIX [8780-011]

 

PROPOSAL

DATE:

 04/26/2025

SUBJECT:

 Open Position

SUBMITTED BY:

 Dr. Hakari Mimko

 

Dearest Council,

I’d hereby like to announce that the culprit behind the terrorist attack of SCP-8780 has been put under rightful justice. Without the Foundation’s intervention, potentially hundreds of people could’ve died under these living weapons. That is what we do — secure, contain, protect.

But there are many people out there who think otherwise. People that see us as ’evil’ and ’unethical’. And although that might be true to an outside observer, they are unable to realize the gravity of the decisions we have to make on a daily basis. For colleagues, friends and family.

Yet these people still prevail, trying to take down our precious fortress that has stood against incomprehensible foes for decades. And if these people are not dealt with, our walls 

will

 crumble.

The solution: The re-founding of my GREY MATTER Division. To filter out any hateful remarks toward us, and drip-feed the public media that shines us in a positive light.

I would also propose myself for the open spot of O5-13, after Sophia Light’s recent outing. I’d like to think that I could handle the stresses that come with the duty as an Overseer; I hope you think this, too.

I hope you take these words to heart, Overseers.

- Dr. Hakari Mimko

Secure. Contain. Protect.

I know what Light meant to you, One. But we cannot let emotions control our decisions. As Mimko said, we do the difficult decisions, so that others don’t have to. Because there is no one else.

Whether you agree with it or not, it is the right thing to do. Vote for Mimko, One.
