SCP-2444 manifestation event in [REDACTED].

Item #:

 SCP-2444

Object Class:

 Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:

 Foundation analytics bot I/O-VID will scan social media postings, local advertisements and cellular communications for terms associated with SCP-2444. Upon confirming a manifestation, plainclothes operatives with Mobile Task Force Psi-7 ("Home Improvement") will deploy to interview vendors, recover instances of SCP-2444-1, amnesticize witnesses, and maintain perimeter security until the anomaly dematerializes. If SCP-2444 collapses into extradimensional space, MTF Psi-7 will sever its link to mainline reality by demolishing the host structure.

Instances of SCP-2444-1 will be transferred to Reliquary Site-76 for research and storage in the Low-Risk Inanimate Objects Warehouses. Full containment and analysis of SCP-2444-2 is not possible at this time.

Description:

 SCP-2444 is a recurring physical manifestation which links mainline reality with extradimensional space. While active, SCP-2444 resembles an indoor flea market stocked with anomalous merchandise (designated instances of SCP-2444-1) and populated by vendors (SCP-2444-2). SCP-2444 manifests approximately 2-7 times per year, appearing within abandoned residential and commercial structures across the continental United States and Canada.

 of the manifestation will dream about SCP-2444 before it appears in physical space. These dreams always involve exploring SCP-2444 in search of a specific object with sentimental value. If they locate that item, the dreamer may become physically entangled with the object, or dream about transforming into merchandise. Though only a small number of individuals will experience this phenomenon, it will strongly predispose them towards visiting SCP-2444 and encouraging others to do the same.

Individuals within the bounds of SCP-2444 experience an altered state of consciousness, similar to hypnagogic cognition.

2

 Characteristic traits include impaired memory, diminished focus, and limited situational awareness. As a result, most witnesses are unlikely to recognize environmental shifts or local divergences from mainline reality until they exit SCP-2444's area of effect.

Instances of SCP-2444-1 resemble objects commonly found in secondhand markets, such as clothing, books, electronics, kitchenware, furniture, art and memorabilia. However, all items are extradimensional in origin, as evidenced by significant deviations from logical norms. In most cases, cursory attempts have been made to conceal these anomalies, but unconventional traits remain obvious: for example, SCP-2444-1-18 is a denim jacket with all tags removed, three sleeves, 24-bit colors, and a patch that reads "Bij Gim".

While the anomaly is active, instances of SCP-2444-2 will engage passing shoppers in conversation, advertise their wares, and conduct transactions via cash or barter.

3

 Instances are unwilling to talk about themselves at length, and will dematerialize upon exiting the host structure. As a result, it is unclear whether SCP-2444-2 are extradimensional entities or local constructs. Foundation personnel approaching these individuals should exercise caution.

Discovery:

 SCP-2444 became known to the Foundation during an unrelated field operation in 1999, when multiple MTF agents reported shared dreams of an anomalous market and tracked its location using physical landmarks. Since then, Site-76 researchers have confirmed evidence of manifestations dating back to the early 1960s.

The following passage has always been displayed as a hanging banner over SCP-2444's entrance:

take what you need when youre done do not throw away

pleas divide youre things among youre friends

where worthy of being loved to
