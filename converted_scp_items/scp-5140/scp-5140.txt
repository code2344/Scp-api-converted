F.A.Q.

{$doesthisfixthebug}

Mt. Everest.

Special Containment Procedures:

 Due to the exorbitant cost and difficulty in safely extracting SCP-5140 instances from Mt. Everest, MTF-Delta-14 "Winter Wonderland" will periodically ascend Everest to bury any SCP-5140 instances in the snow. Campaigns are underway to tighten restrictions for climbing permits for Mt. Everest on both the Nepalese and Tibetan sides.

Description:

 SCP-5140 refers to a number of frozen corpses scattered across Mt. Everest, located in the Himalayas of Tibet. The number of SCP-5140 instances is unclear, but accepted to be over 100 and below 200 at the time of writing. SCP-5140 instances are ectoentropic; when physically exposed to heat of any form, including body heat, they will absorb it without raising their temperature, which rests at approximately 10°C (50°F). This process usually renders physical contact with SCP-5140 instances fatal. If an individual dies as a result of contact with SCP-5140 instances, their corpse will become another SCP-5140 instance.

HOLD STEADY

A rescue detachment of MTF Delta-14 arrived at Charlie Smith's GPS tracker an hour and thirty-six minutes later. They sighted no unburied SCP-5140 instances on their approach. Smith's body was discovered, lacking the signs typical of a SCP-5140 instance. Autopsy indicates he died from exposure and suffocation due to inadequate oxygen intake. Further investigation indicated his oxygen intake valve was damaged during the ascent to the summit. Bodies of Arnold Hillary and Patrick Edmund were discovered higher up Everest. Hillary died from exposure, while Edmund was found to be an SCP-5140 instance.

It is currently believed that Smith's inadequate oxygen led to him hallucinating SCP-5140 instances blocking their path and destroying their campsite. Hillary's foot was found wedged into a rockfall, likely the source of his immobility.

This incident has been taken into account and supply manifests for future expeditions adjusting accordingly.

EVENT REPORT

Scanner image of Mt. Everest. Brighter zones indicate increased SCP-5140 density.

LOCATION:

 Mt. Everest, Nepal

STATUS:

 Concluded

TIME:

 01:49 PM (local time) April 25 2024

DISRUPTION CLASS:

 Keneq

EVENT SUMMARY:

 Increased global temperatures have resulted in significant thawing of ice sheets and snow drifts on Everest. Such thawing caused a large avalanche at 11:49 local time which moved a large amount of snow off the summit. Lower depth of snow allowed scanning planes to identify significant amount of SCP-5140 instances below the snow. Further excavation revealed SCP-5140 instances form a significant portion of Everest itself.

Currently, it is estimated 45% of Mt. Everest's mass is formed by corpses.
