CLASSIFIED

Item #: SCP-5609

Object Class: Keter

A component of the satellite array surrounding SCP-5609

Special Containment Procedures:

 An array of Foundation-owned satellites surround SCP-5609 at all times, and are programmed to constantly project a selectively antimemetic field around the object to prevent its viewing by civilians. Unmanned research probe SCPS 

Spearhead

 has been landed on SCP-5609, and is currently being used to collect its tissue samples and take vital readings. Any changes in the orbital pattern of SCP-5609 are to be monitored, and circumvented via movement of the satellite array.

Description:

 SCP-5609 is a massive (230 km in diameter), bioluminescent, spherical organism, currently in orbit 30,000 km above the earth's surface. SCP-5609 constantly emits yellow light, and upon cursory observation resembles a small moon.

Close-up inspection of SCP-5609 has shown it to possess features similar to those of some beetle larvae, such as a small, discolored head with two compound eyes and two short mandibles; two visible legs protruding from underneath its head; and soft, segmented skin.

Addendum: Recovered Data

The following is a list of data pertaining to SCP-5609, collected by SCPS 

Spearhead.

SCP-5609 moves periodically; however, such motion consists of not much more than momentary twitching of its legs and mandibles.

SCP-5609 lacks the ability to steer and propel its body through space. Its orbit is entirely passive.

The metabolism of SCP-5609 is hypothesized to be up to 3,000 times slower than that of any terrestrial insect.

The presence of spiracles

 on the body of SCP-5609 indicate that it is not biologically suited for survival in a vacuum.

A section of skin on the back of SCP-5609 protrudes from the organism, as if being pulled.

Addendum: Incident Log

On March 22, 2021, SCP-5609 disappeared, along with SCPS 

Spearhead

. The anomaly was reclassified as Neutralized after an extensive search of the area of outer space surrounding Earth found no trace of it.

One month later, SCPS 

Spearhead

 re-appeared in high Earth orbit and immediately fell through the atmosphere. Despite sustaining heavy damage upon crash-landing, the following audio log remained intact.

(Heavy static is audible, but dissipates after 7 seconds. Upon its dissipation, two voices are heard.)

Unknown-1:

 Hoooooo-eeee! Now 

this

 one's bound to be a doozy.

Unknown-2:

 Can't believe they bit. Oh, we'll sure be eatin' well tonight!

(After a few moments, the voices become louder. The recording distorts slightly as a result.)

Unknown-2:

 Hey, Willie? Uh… you gotta see this.

Unknown-1:

 What the- awwwww, c'mon, not this 

again.

Unknown-2:

 What is it?

Unknown-1:

 Oh, just another one of those shiny bugs. Toss it back in.

Unknown-2:

 Could I keep it? It looks pretty cool.

Unknown-1:

 

(Audibly sighs)

 You can't 

eat

 cool, Amos.

Unknown-2:

 All right, all right, 

fine.

 

(The sound of rushing air is heard, followed by a loud splash. The voices begin to fade.)

Unknown-1:

 …gotta cast out by the moon next time. I heard tell the folks there're a bunch more gullible.

(Static becomes audible. The recording ends.)

The area surrounding the moon is currently being monitored for signs of SCP-5609 re-emergence.
