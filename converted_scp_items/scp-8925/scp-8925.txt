Item #:

 SCP-8925

Object Class:

 Safe

Special Containment Procedures:

 SCP-8925 is kept within meeting room 1-23-109 of Site-40, where it was discovered. Junior Researcher

 Sylvan Harrington is not to be disturbed while filling out SCP-8925. Containment and long-term study of SCP-8925 is currently ensured by Jr. Rsr. Harrington's inability to free themselves of its effect; this state has been largely self-maintaining.

Description:

 SCP-8925 is a copy of a Foundation employee introduction form printed as part of an August 2005 recruitment drive. It is physically indistinguishable from any other reproduction of its template.

 

SCP-8925 induces a poorly understood memetic compulsion in those who view it/attempt to fill it out

, preventing the subject from directing their attention away from the task of completing it. Attempting to disrupt this effect has been entirely unsuccessful, though deemed undesirable. It is currently theorized that completion of the form would nullify its effects, although what constitutes "completion" is uncertain.
