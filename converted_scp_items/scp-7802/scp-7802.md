**Standard Control Procedures:** The following ceremonial containment programs are to be executed on SCP-7802-A continuously.
**Code:** Dawn

After all the candles burned completely, an individual with basic knowledge and skills of thaumaturgy is to be asked to enter the ring, carrying sterling silver accessories weight no less than 2 grams, then touch the easternmost candle with their forehead and move at a low speed to connect all the candles into a complete circle by wax. The procedure is to be conducted once a day.
**Note:** Decrease the possibility of containment failure; decrease the external spectral contamination.
**Code:** Burned
**Description:** When the full moon is visible, no less than 2 kilograms of paper occultic texts are to be burnt up outdoors until the smoke covers all the peep windows of the underground parts of the containment facility. Meanwhile, 82 different unopened letters are to be thrown into the flame and be left until the flame is completely extinguished. The remaining unburnt letters are to be recycled and archived. The procedure is to be conducted at least once every three months.
**Note:** Decrease the possibility of containment failure; increase the stability of reality.
**Code:** Idol
**Description:** A wooden 1.5m tall St Andrew’s Cross is to be placed in the center hall in the containment facility. The same processes are to be done for Coptic Cross, Celtic Cross, St Anthony’s Cross, and Jerusalem Cross respectively. A 0.5m tall ceramic statue of Jupiter is to be placed before each cross, and the same for statues of Juno, Mars, Mercury, and Minerva, respectively. Five personnel who do not know about Abrahamic religions and Ancient Roman culture are to be asked to lift the crosses from the rear, and hit the statues until they are completely smashed into pieces. The powder remains are to be poured into local soil after being mixed with pure water. The procedure is to be conducted at 2:00 AM on Jan 1st of every year.

A human individual named T███████ X████[1](javascript:;) is asked to cross the arch and spread no less than 5 grams of his blood[2](javascript:;) on the ground under the arch. During the next 13 years, the arch is to be made sure to collapse because of thunderstrike. If the arch doesn't collapse after the thunderstrike or it collapses because of other reasons, the ceremony and the year counting are to be restarted. The procedure is to be conducted once every 13 years.
**Note:** Decrease the possibility of containment failure; increase the stability of time.
**Code:** Nike
**Description:** A designated personnel is asked to crush down a 4-leaf variant of _Trifolium pratense_ and drink it with water. After drinking, the personnel will wear a wreath made of _Laurus nobilis_ , and throw a coin[3](javascript:;) on the open ground. If the upward side of the coin after it lands is the female portrait with a spear, throw Spade-shaped Coin, Ban-liang Coin and Wu-zhu Coin[4](javascript:;) into the core area of the containment facility, one of each; if the upward side is the female portrait with wings, then end the ceremony.
**Note:** Decrease the possibility of containment failure.
**Code:** Eternal

The procedure is to be conducted once every [REDACTED].
**Note:** Greatly decrease the possibility of containment failure.
**Description:** SCP-7802-A is an abandoned research facility, which was reused by the Foundation on 15 July 1987 to build up the containment of SCP-7802. SCP-7802-A locates in a nameless valley, and it is believed that the building has existed for at least ██████ years. The surface of it has been masked as a normal local building, and the only way to recognize it is a metal airtight door that leads to the underground structure, with a placard that reads "Anomalous Religious Expressions Department" embedded on it.
**Addendum:** Some of the ceremonial containment programs were abandoned.
**Code:** Uso

We will try our best to contain it.

**Addendum:**
To the latecomers：
The first time when I was transferred to SCP-7802, I didn't understand the purpose of these ceremonies at all. I didn't know why we stuck to repeating these ceremonies with a vague effect, containing an anomaly with a vague description. These ceremonies are also so gentle that they are not like those typical ARED-managed ceremonies I have handled, with surprisingly almost no blood and sacrifice can be seen. I asked the principal at that time, and his answer was only one sentence: We don't have enough manpower to consume.
But every ceremony and the corresponding pattern has its own _meaning_ , and I didn't know this until later. The ceremonies have a close relationship with other contained projects, but the truth is more than that. We are using these ceremonies to build a virtual _religious performance_ , decrease the possibility that the anomaly escapes being contained, and pray that luck is on our side. We only know that in any case, 7802's failure in containment should be avoided, but we are unable to do so. Among countless reality iterations, we are alive now just because we are lucky enough.
