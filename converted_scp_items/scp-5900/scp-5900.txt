F.A.Q.

{$doesthisfixthebug}

Service availability during SCP-5900.

Special Containment Procedures:

 RAISA's Surveillance Division is determining the cause of SCP-5900 (ticket #E4K07U2) and creating technical countermeasures to reduce the severity of a similar event in the future (ticket #30VNI4F). The SCP-5900 Containment Director is assigning technicians to replace all damaged components and investigate suspect auxiliaries.

The Department of Internal Security has opened an investigation. [DATA REDACTED 5/INTSEC]

Description:

 SCP-5900 was an outage of PANOPTICON, lasting for five days from 2022/05/19 12:15 to 2022/05/24 21:20 UTC. During this time, surveillance satellites, Site-07 communications, intelligence processing, and IntSCPFN file sync were inoperable. The full extent and nature of the anomaly are presently unknown.

Addendum 5900.1

PANOPTICON PROJECT BRIEF

▶OPEN ADDENDUM◀

▷CLOSE◁

Project #:

 RAISA-31409

Authorized By:

 Overseer Council

PANOPTICON refers to a number of interconnected technological and paratechnological constructs, which collectively enable global oversight.

The Atreus Satellite Array is a Foundation-launched fleet of modular satellites, with orbits configured to ensure full coverage of the Earth at all times. Each satellite has a surveillance installation (see 4/PANOPTICON/HDW04 for schematics), including X-ray antennas and Kant receivers. They also have several hardpoints for weapons and reality anchor attachments, set at the direction of the Department of Applied Force.

Relay installed at the base of a streetlamp

Additionally, the Department of Applied Influence's Field Monitoring Division is responsible for the installation and maintenance of over ██ million input devices, including SEP-shielded cameras, microphones, links into existing civilian and government surveillance systems, thaumaturgic particle detectors, and Kant counters.

All gathered surveillance information is processed at Site-07, located in the Norton Bay off the coast of Alaska. Due to its secure location and increasing role in 

Foundation archival operations

, it was established as the headquarters of RAISA in 1970. Fifteen years later, the DEEPWELL backup system entered service there as well.

Protected Site-07

Records are loaded into an anomalous RDBMS (relational database management system) and indexed accordingly. SKYEYE.aic continuously queries this database to look for correlations or abnormalities which may indicate potential extranormal events, objects, or activity by groups of interest.

On 19██/12/12 a thaumaturgic ritual was performed at the direction of the Overseer Council, resulting in metaphysical anchoring constructs being embedded within areas of the infosphere associated with the Foundation, normalcy, and knowledge.

As information is duplicated throughout all PANOPTICON nodes with at least three parallel processing sites each, an extended outage is extremely improbable. Combined with the anchoring constructs, the calculated probability of an outage is less than 1 in 10

24

.

All components of the metaphysical anchoring system were found to be active during SCP-5900.

jtaylor

 kicked 

raisa-bot

.

<lgonzales>

 I'll look and see what's wrong with the bot

<jjohnson>

 uh why is the site locking down? is there a drill?

<tscott>

 wtf

<tscott>

 the python webcrawlers are actually broken

<jjohnson>

 no way

Lost external network access. Switching ROMP to site-only.

<rhill>

 yeah I can't connect to the panopticon spy nodes. something's up

raisa-bot

 has joined.

<raisa-bot>

 COMMAND.aic broadcast: Extensive outage in effect. RAISA command has been notified.

<lgonzales>

 fuck.

Excerpt: Day 1, 6:41 AM

<jtaylor>

 all right, so here's how management has decided to set this up

<jtaylor>

 team A will look through the broken services

<jtaylor>

 team B goes through all our deploys

<jtaylor>

 team C looks at the metabed anchor system

<jtaylor>

 classifications are still in force, so please report any unintentional contact with level-4/5 intel

<jjohnson>

 sounds good, I'll take filesync

<tscott>

 

jtaylor

: isn't there a provisional scp for this incident?

<jtaylor>

 uh yes, there should be. I don't see it though

<jjohnson>

 the local database was in the middle of a sync and got corrupted

<jjohnson>

 command.aic wasn't able to save the provisional skip anywhere

<jtaylor>

 can we just roll it back?

<jjohnson>

 yeah, give me a moment

jjohnson

 uploaded file: 

scp-report-1560142360.ftml ⬇

<tscott>

 wow, why was it given "scp-5900"?

<lgonzales>

 i guess we've never had a slot-assign outage before lol

<rhill>

 okay, so we can see all the satellites above us, but just can't connect for some reason

<jjohnson>

 we can connect directly, right?

<rhill>

 yes. big pain in the arse though

<rhill>

 actually jim has a script to help with that. lemme see

<jtaylor>

 the technicians just finished inspecting the shortwave radio antennas. doesn't look like there's any damage

<tscott>

 that's good at least

<jtaylor>

 so we're pretty sure it's a software or configuration problem

<rhill>

 hey all, I was able to connect to satellite atreus-48. status normal, no connections to other sites

<rhill>

 no extraterrestrial abnormalities

<jtaylor>

 upload the report here?

<rhill>

 sure, give me a sec

<rhill>

 the ground data is loading really slow, but nothing weird so far

<tscott>

 why do we care about surface readings? don't we just want connection logs?

<lgonzales>

 we don't know if this is a k-class

<tscott>

 oh

Excerpt: Day 2, 4:38 PM

<lgonzales>

 man this thaumaturgy link code is really hard to understand

<rhill>

 I know it's old, but it's not *that* bad, is it?

<lgonzales>

 oh it's fine, I just forgot how hard it is to wrap your head around this stuff lol

<jjohnson>

 you went to ICSUT, right? did you take that paratemporal networking class?

<lgonzales>

 

jjohnson

 indeed. consuming packets before you've sent them was the hardest part for me

<jtaylor>

 how are the satellite systems looking? the links have been operable for hours but the system still can't do the handshake

<rhill>

 I'm really not sure. I've been running local experiments and they work fine, but once we plug into the real system it fails

<rhill>

 maybe something wrong with our thaumic keys?

<jtaylor>

 hmm. will be hard to make new ones though, given the lack of communications here

<lgonzales>

 this is interesting

<lgonzales>

 so metabed has several conceptual hooks for protecting our systems, right

<lgonzales>

 all of them are "latched on" so to speak, but a few aren't "transferring"?

<lgonzales>

 the model is weird, if you know about alpha-lambda loops you know what I'm talking about

<jjohnson>

 what how? there aren't many declassified docs but

<jjohnson>

 that is only possible if the originator decides to decouple iirc

<jjohnson>

 which I *highly* doubt the O5s would do

<lgonzales>

 I know, it's bizarre

<rhill>

 maybe a third party tried to take it from us?

<lgonzales>

 nah, it would require way too much energy

<lgonzales>

 though I think looking at swapping out conceptual targets is a possibility. 

jtaylor

 can you get me access to the 5/metabed ritual info?

<jtaylor>

 I'll see what I can do

Excerpt: Day 5, 1:08 PM

<jtaylor>

 The administrative liaison is saying you can formulate a new thaumic unit, but it can't be overlapping with the originals

<lgonzales>

 wtf? my plan doesn't, it attaches to uniq-418ef and uniq-0a341

<lgonzales>

 tell them to just give me the full fucking plans and they can amnesticize me after

<jtaylor>

 I've already told you that isn't going to happen

<lgonzales>

 this is such bullshit

<jjohnson>

 fundamental rituals are always safeguarded the most

<lgonzales>

 

jjohnson

 I didn't ask you

<lgonzales>

 sorry, that was uncalled for

<rhill>

 I think we can at least restore the satellite connections with conceptual positioning

<rhill>

 those plans would be helpful there at least

<lgonzales>

 to be honest, I don't even believe the documentation. it claims they attach to "the concept of knowledge"

<lgonzales>

 but I doubt it. that's too fundamental, they probably just got some "sending data" side-stream. way easier to do

<lgonzales>

 and it would explain why it being interrupted fucked all our comms

<rhill>

 is it interrupted?

<lgonzales>

 what else could it be? it's not broken or the system would've repaired and it's not detached since I just checked

<jtaylor>

 

lgonzales

: some good news. maria jones is stepping in and giving us access to the ritual plans

<jtaylor>

 don't burn me here, we better get something substantial from this

<lgonzales>

 oh thank god

jtaylor

 uploaded file: 

[DATA REDACTED 5/PANOPTICON] ⬇

<jjohnson>

 holy shit, look at that

<lgonzales>

 god damn they weren't lying

<lgonzales>

 we can fix this now. 

rhill

 you have that great ritual autoexecutor tool, right?

<rhill>

 it's standard now, renamed to "thaumexec"

<lgonzales>

 excellent

<lgonzales>

 so let's reconfigure on the main anchor points, with the proposed backups

<lgonzales>

 just started it

<tscott>

 uh guys, the monitor is saying the network has abnormally high input?

<raisa-bot>

 Monitor: communications is UP

<tscott>

 wait

<tscott>

 the system is working again?

RECOVERY UPDATE

▶OPEN ADDENDUM◀

▷CLOSE◁

Critical services began recovering at 2022/05/24 21:09 UTC, after which the PANOPTICON metaphysical anchoring system automatically recalibrated itself. An inspection discovered an unusual HTML payload in one of the anchor's logs. A screenshot has been attached below:

The origin and meaning of this notice is unclear. Investigation is ongoing.
