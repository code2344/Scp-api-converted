Foundation operatives covertly embedded within various branches of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) across the United States are to remain informed of any indications of recent containment breaches.

 Embedded agents are to destroy discovered IRS documents relating to security breaches after IRS internal processing, and all non-Foundation personnel exposed to the contents of such documents are to undergo amnesticization.

2

In case of an SCP-7084 outbreak, several foundation-operated AIs are to create files for SCP-7084 to infect, to prevent the destruction of other, important files.

//DATA¬†CORRUPTED//

Description:

SCP-7084 refers to an anomalous phenomenon involving the manifestation of tax papers after events that result in notable expenditure of Foundation resources, primarily containment breaches. The papers materialize within the affected organization's financial department or relevant administrative area.

SCP-7084 will typically appear within 24 hours following a breach. The manifestation process of SCP-7084 is spontaneous and occurs regardless of the physical location or time of the breach.

3

 The papers resemble standard tax documents, including forms, schedules, and annual statements.

Upon examination, the contents of SCP-7084 appear to be genuine tax-related documents associated with individuals directly affected by the breach.

The personal details and financial information contained within SCP-7084 are always current and accurately reflect the tax obligations and liabilities of the individuals involved. This includes income statements, deductions, and tax liabilities.

In the event that SCP-7084 is not filed and submitted following a breach, internal Foundation files will begin to slowly be replaced with instances of SCP-7084, with preference given to files related to taxes, the IRS, SCP-7084 itself, and financial accounts.

Part II: Nature of Breach:

Indicate the nature of the containment breach in question. Select the appropriate option from the following.

[ ] Physical

[ ] Temporal

[ ] Digital

[ ] SCP-682

[ ] Religious

[ ] Thaumaturgical

[ ] Conceptual

[ ] Paranormal

[ ] Other (Please Specify:

//DATA¬†CORRUPTED//

Discovery:

SCP-7084 was initially discovered following the breach of 

ùê¢5790

,

4

 with all information regarding ùê¢5790 being purged. While searching for information regarding ùê¢5790, several records were found related to ùê¢5790 in the IRS archives. Further research lead to thousands of papers about the SCP Foundation and containment breaches.

Records indicate that prior to its discovery, personnel have consistently disregarded the anomalous nature of SCP-7084 documents, which have been filed without question since the establishment of the Foundation, unbeknownst to the administration. Since its discovery, SCP-7084 has posed an Amida-Class Disruption to the inner workings of the Foundation.

After several years of researching the history of the IRS, many documents related to the SCP Foundation have been uncovered, including the identities of the O5 Council and the Administrator. For more information, please refer to "Further Research".

Part III: Statement of Explanation:

Please explain the breach and its impact on financial systems, including any relevant dates, parties involved, and an estimated loss of personnel. Attach additional sheets if necessary.

Further¬†Research:

On 9/14/2025, the Foundation started an investigation into the past of the Internal Revenue Service. Through anomalous means, the Foundation has discovered that the existence of the IRS predates the existence of humanity. IRS records include information regarding every known and unknown group of interest.

Upon further examination, instances of groups with the identical goal to the IRS have appeared within all civilizations and groups across reality, with the concept of "taxes" having a notable imprint within the noosphere.

Further research into the nature of the IRS is an ongoing priority.

Part VI: Declaration:

Under penalties of perjury, I declare that I have examined this amended return, including accompanying schedules and statements, and to the best of my knowledge and belief, it is true, correct, and complete.

Date:

There are only two guarantees in life:

 

 

Death, and taxes.

 

 

And the O5s have avoided death for way too long.

Part VII: Instructions for Submission:

Upon completion, submit this amended tax return to the International Revenue Service, accompanied by any necessary supporting documentation relating to the breach and its impact. Please retain a copy for your records. And stop sticking your nose where it doesn't belong.

. Contact your RAISA representative to get in contact with embedded agents.

2

. Endeminis class anomalies influence common Foundation practice, and as such must be managed rather than contained, as containment is not possible.

3

. Temporal loops and pocket dimensions are also affected.
