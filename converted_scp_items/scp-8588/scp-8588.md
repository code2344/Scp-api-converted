SCP-8588.
**Item #:** SCP-8588
**Object Class:** Safe
**Special Containment Procedures:** The area surrounding SCP-8588 is to be enclosed with 2-meter-tall chain-link fence, marked with standard signage prohibiting trespassing. Remotely monitored security cameras have been placed on the surrounding property and within SCP-8588 itself. Following the events of Addendum 8588.2, the ladder leading to SCP-8588's entryway has been removed.
**Description:** SCP-8588 is a wooden treehouse located in Llewellyn, Pennsylvania. The structure itself has proven impervious to damage from weather conditions, wildlife, and fires. Despite being constructed from untreated pine and lacking any known protective finish, SCP-8588 has shown no signs of rot, mold, or structural degradation since its discovery in 2007.
When entered by three or more children between the ages of 6 and 10, SCP-8588's inner space shifts into a meeting chamber furnished with beanbag chairs, an assortment of plush animals, and a collection of coolers and cabinets containing juice boxes and other foodstuffs. The source of these items and the cause leading them to appear inside of SCP-8588 are unknown. Any persons outside of this specified age range who enter SCP-8588 are unable to cause this shift, even when accompanied by those who meet the criteria, with only one recorded exception.[1](javascript:;)
Children who enter SCP-8588 under these conditions are informally integrated into a legislature referred to as "The Council" by the children themselves. This process does not appear to involve any formal initiation ritual or external prompting, other than granting themselves a preferred name.[2](javascript:;) Participants refer to themselves as "councilmembers" and assume roles[3](javascript:;) and responsibilities. Councilmembers also exhibit mild behavioral changes such as increased cooperation and elevated vocabulary beyond developmental expectations.
Any meeting within SCP-8588 typically results in the councilmembers deciding on one or more "rules" to put into motion. This process usually involves a member suggesting a rule and having the others discuss and vote on it. After a rule is agreed upon, it assumes the status of an enforceable law within a 3 kilometer radius of SCP-8588. Individuals within the radius behave as though the rule is a legitimate ordinance, despite no changes to genuine local, state, or federal legalities. These effects generally last no more than two weeks.
**Addendum 8588.1:** Examples of Rules
Below are excerpts from a notebook documenting rules implemented by councilmembers, taken from a Llewellyn citizen who recalled spending time as a "Rule Recorder" within SCP-8588 during their childhood.
Rule # | Title | Description | Effect  
---|---|---|---  
001 | No More Bedtime | Proposed by councilwoman Ashley the Wise at the start of the first recorded meeting. Passed unanimously. | All clocks within the affected area froze at 8:00 PM for three consecutive nights before resuming at 8:00 AM. The sun did not set during this time.  
003 | Everyone Has To Share | Prompted by a dispute over juice box flavor distribution. Passed unanimously after a mediation between the two members in dispute. | Individuals in the area exhibited a compulsion to share personal belongings upon request, including phones, pets, and half-eaten snacks. The effect wore off after 48 hours.  
009 | Wednesday Is Costume Day | Suggested by councilman Cool Zach. Opposition was voiced by Derek the Ghost, but rule was passed 5-1. | Local schools and workplaces reported every individual wearing a costume that Wednesday. No one appeared to find this unusual. Effect did not occur any succeeding week.  
015 | You Have To Say Sorry If You're Mean | Introduced by councilwoman Big T, citing recent incidents of animosity. Rule passed 6-2. | Individuals performing an action perceived as rude or impolite uncontrollably apologized immediately after doing so, regardless of intent or awareness behind the action. Effect wore off after 5 days.  
020 | No More School On Monday | Submitted by councilman Jimmy the Smart. Passed unanimously. | For 2 weeks, local school districts remained closed for the weekend on Mondays.  
022 | Summer Forever | Presented by councilman Light Shadow. Rule vetoed 5-6 after a passionate speech by Marcus the Strong about his love for autumn. | None. Presumably would have extended the duration of summer weather conditions within the affected area.  
030 | All Animals Are Friends | Recommended by councilman Gregory the Great. Fiercely debated over, as many councilmembers noted their fear of animals such as bears, but rule passed 7-6 after councilwoman Awesome Jess insisted her stuffed animal's vote was legitimate. | Caused temporary pacification and increased friendliness in local wildlife for over 8 days. Multiple deer, bears, and coyotes were found calmly entering residential areas and interacting with the populace. No persons appeared to show fear or anger towards any wildlife during this time.  
**Addendum 8588.2:** Containment Breach
On 01/28/2010, a group of five adolescents, later identified as students of the local high school, scaled the fence containing SCP-8588 and entered it. Despite being over the age limit required to activate SCP-8588's meeting chamber, security footage showed that the interior shift occurred regardless. The following is an excerpt from the recovered footage.
_(Sound of fence rattling followed by creaking wood and laughter.)_
**Voice 1:** Damn, that was shorter than I remembered.
**Voice 2:** Yeah, well, you were shorter back then. Everything was taller.
**Voice 3:** Yo, hurry up, it's freezing out here!
**Voice 1:** Yeah, yeah.
_(The adolescents are observed entering the interior of SCP-8588.)_
**Voice 4:** Wow.. takes me back!
**Voice 1:** Wait.. do you feel that?
_(A low ambient hum is heard. The room suddenly shifts into SCP-8588's meeting chamber.)_
**Voice 5:** Woah!
**Voice 3:** Jesus! I forgot about that.
**Voice 4:** Oh my god! Look! It's Mister Raff!
_(The fourth teenager grabs a stuffed animal resembling a giraffe while the first looks inside a cooler.)_
**Voice 5:** How'd this even work out? Remember when we had to kick out Jess's brother 'cause he was too old?
**Voice 4:** Yeah, haha, he got mad about it. Hmm, I don't kn-
**Voice 1:** Hey look, they still have the juice boxes! Yo, Jamie, want one?
**Voice 2:** Sure. Do they still have the chips?
_(The first teenager looks inside a nearby cabinet.)_
**Voice 1:** Haha, yeah! Which ones do y'all want?
**Voices 2, 3, and 4:** Doritos!
**Voice 5:** Uh, let me get the Lays.
_(The rest of the group glare at the fifth teenager.)_
**Voice 3:** Get a load of Danny the Different over here.
_(They all laugh. The first teenager hands out bags of chips and juice boxes as the group settles into beanbags.)_
**Voice 4:** You know, I used to be the Head of Snacks.
**Voice 5:** Nuh-uh, that was me.
**Voice 4:** Yuh-huh, it became me after we impeached you for hoarding all the juice. Clear violation of rule three.
**Voice 1:** Ouh, look at all of these papers.. hey, I think you wrote this one, Talia.
_(The first passes the sheet of paper to the third.)_
**Voice 3:** Huh.. "if you knock over a plushie, you have to say sorry".. yeah, that was definitely me.
**Voice 5:** Man, I forgot how serious we were about this stuff.
**Voice 1:** You were the one who started that "war on raisins".
**Voice 5:** And I stand by that! Still hate those shriveled things.
_(They laugh again. There is a pause as they stop to consume their snacks.)_
**Voice 4:** We should make another rule! For old time's sake and all that.
**Voice 2:** Ah, but what would it be?
**Voice 5:** How about no math after 3 PM?
**Voice 1:** That one's not even new. That was rule 12.
**Voice 3:** Yeah, I think you made that one after you cried over fractions in Miss Angley's.
**Voice 5:** I did _not_ cry. I was.. I was just stressed!
**Voice 4:** What about.. no taxes?
**Voice 3:** We already don't have those.
**Voice 4:** Yeah, but this way, we won't have them ever.
**Voice 1:** I want a rule that says Danny can't pick Lays.
**Voice 5:** What?! This is an outrage!
**Voice 2:** We could say.. we all get one more juice box. I'm still kinda thirsty.
**Voice 1:** I can get behind that.
_(The rest of the group murmurs in agreement.)_
**Voice 1:** Welp, all in favor, say aye!
**All:** Aye!
**Voice 2:** Hey, Sam, write it down! Just like we used to.
_(The first teenager scribbles the rule on a sheet of paper while reading aloud.)_
**Voice 1:** Rule one hundred.. everyone.. gets.. one.. more.. juice box.
**Voice 3:** Is it actually the hundredth?
**Voice 1:** Think so.
**Voice 5:** Who cares? I'm getting my juice.
The group of adolescents were observed leaving SCP-8588 two hours after entering. After their exit, every citizen of Llewellyn found themselves suddenly holding an unopened juice box.[4](javascript:;) Following this containment breach, the ladder leading to SCP-8588's entryway was removed. Research into why the anomalous effect of SCP-8588 occurred despite the group's adolescence and why its previous range of influence became extended is ongoing.
