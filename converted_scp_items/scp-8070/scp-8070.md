**Special Containment Procedures:** Any alterations involving SCP-8070, whether of objects or personnel, must be promptly reported upon discovery. Retrieval efforts for the original subject are warranted only for items of significant value, provided that the broken instance can be traced back to its former location.
Certain landfills and mass graves suspected of hosting SCP-8070 are continuously monitored. Destruction methods such as incineration, smashing, and demolition are recommended for waste and cadaver processing. Locations for such activities should be chosen with caution to avoid proximity to residential areas and areas of human congregation, particularly undisclosed Foundation facilities with a high density of personnel.
Rooms containing personnel or materials should maintain minimal lighting and ventilation levels, especially during nighttime. While the effectiveness of reality stabilizers against SCP-8070 remains unproven, they are deployed within certain ranges as a precautionary measure.
**Description:** SCP-8070 is a recurring phenomenon primarily affecting objects and entities in enclosed spaces with poor lighting conditions within human residences. Its manifestation is sporadic but tends to occur more frequently near landfill sites, dumpster collections, garbage recycling stations, and poorly maintained sewage pipes.
Objects influenced by SCP-8070 undergo alterations in appearance while maintaining consistent net weight and basic chemical composition. All observed instances of SCP-8070 involve sudden changes such as rotting, decay, staining by unknown contaminants (typically wet soil and human excretions), and occasionally disintegration or shattering.
SCP-8070 is currently hypothesized to be a form of reality distortion affecting the inner structure of objects while adhering to the law of mass conservation. As such, reality-stabilizing technologies are employed in attempts to neutralize SCP-8070 within testable ranges.

**Addendum 1:** Incident Reports
**Time:** 09:47 AM, Sep 29, 2023.
**Place:** Food storage house of a local grocery store.
**Description:** 25 kg of packaged food was discovered altered to resemble spent food packages, emitting a strong odor of rotten meat. While shop owners initially suspected burglary, subsequent investigation revealed no recognition of the altered packages as goods in their possession. Chemical analysis failed to identify traces of human cells or genetic fingerprints.
The affected garbage was subsequently removed, and no further instances of SCP-8070 occurred after the installation of cameras equipped with lamps inside the storage facility.
**Time:** 08:23 AM, Oct 19, 2023.
**Place:** Facility kitchen of Site-██.
**Description:** All canned food and raw materials with opaque packaging were transformed into an indiscernible, foul-smelling sludge within their original containers. Staff discovered the altered contents after heating and cooking the food, revealing a thick reddish-yellow sludge instead of the expected food items. Analysis of the sample revealed small chicken bone fragments, along with other food scraps, human hairs, phlegm, and decomposed tissue pieces too degraded for identification.
**Time:** 07:04 AM, Nov 8, 2023.
**Place:** Gymnasium in a middle school situated on the former site of a landfill [REDACTED].
**Description:** Metal equipment within the gymnasium vanished and was replaced by wreckage from various machinery, including bent rebars, broken lathes, and rusted pieces likely from scrapped cars. Subsequent investigation confirmed the materials as buried waste from [REDACTED], an automobile assembly factory formerly affiliated with the Foundation. Following the incident, the contaminated equipment was removed, and replacement equipment was donated to the school by Foundation personnel under the guise of charitable giving.
**Time:** 10:45 PM, Dec 22, 2023.
**Place:** A public restroom near the aboveground portion of Site-██.
**Description:** Two civilians exiting the restroom observed a viscous liquid with foul-smelling solid content flowing from the faucet. The liquid resembled sewage mixed with feces, blood, vomit, and wet paper splinters. Subsequent investigation revealed a clogged water pipe, which was promptly repaired. The restroom was later demolished due to disuse, with no further instances of municipal water system contamination reported.
**Time:** 01:33 AM, Dec 25, 2023.
**Place:** Countryside residence of [REDACTED], a two-story civilian house.
**Description:** The family's six-year-old daughter was reported missing, while had been asleep in her bedroom without a window. Upon inspection, her mother found an unidentified young human cadaver with partially dismembered limbs, moderate decomposition, and covered in dried mud and insects lying in the daughter's place. Police confirmed the identity of the corpse as a five-year-old boy who died in a car accident one month prior and was buried nearby without cremation.
Foundation investigators, accompanied by police, excavated the burial site, revealing the victim's body buried 1.8 meters underground in a crooked position. The victim appeared to have died from suffocation and dehydration.
**Time:** 12:01 AM, Jan 1, 2024.
**Place:** Emergency shelter on the basement floor of Site-███.
**Description:** During a routine inspection, the nuke-defense structure with an airtight gate was found displaced, forming a deformed structure within the office building above it, resulting in significant structural damage. While no casualties were reported, reality anchors were subsequently deployed throughout the site to preserve spatial consistency within the underground complex.
Continuous artificial lighting was mandated for nearby subterranean facilities in response to the incident.
