_Acentronura tentaculata_. This species did not exist prior to an SCP-4800 occurrence in 2001.
**Item #:** SCP-4800
**Object Class:** Parauniversal
**Containment Class:** Keter
**Special Containment Procedures:** The process of SCP-4800 is not to be interfered with in any way. No effort is to be undertaken to explore instances of SCP-4800-A or communicate with them. Scranton Reality Anchors and other devices built to extract reality levels from alternate timelines are to be programmed to avoid targeting SCP-4800-A instances. These procedures have been unanimously agreed on by all instances of the SCP Foundation in the Multiversal Foundation Alliance.
In the event that a current timeline is subject to SCP-4800, all documents containing information pertinent to world history are to be migrated to a DEEPWELL server. No measures are to be undertaken to halt or reverse SCP-4800.
Efforts to contact Timeline E-2a0e8a129b are to continue.
**Description:** SCP-4800 is a presently unclear factor, force, or phenomenon responsible for the merging of parallel timelines. The exact cause of SCP-4800 is uncertain; however, it is hypothesized that [DATA REDACTED 5/MULTIU – SEE ADDENDUM 03]
Due to its nature, the inner process of SCP-4800 is difficult to observe. However, SCP-4800 can be observed from the outside, and proceeds as follows:
  * The affected timelines (collectively SCP-4800-A, individually SCP-4800-A1 and SCP-4800-A2) will become inaccessible, and matter will not be able to enter or exit SCP-4800-A through multiversal channels. Photons are still able to be transmitted, allowing for temporary inter-universal communication.
  * The sky on Earth will become black, and all visible stars will disappear. This is believed to be due to SCP-4800 fundamentally altering the properties of light to introduce resistance in vacuums. In addition, medium-to-long range data transmission becomes impossible for reasons that are presently uncertain. This effect has been observed on all planets during SCP-4800, and will last from two hours to five years before transitioning to the next phase.
  * At this point, communication between SCP-4800-A and other timelines becomes impossible. SCP-4800-A2 will slowly dissolve, shrinking until all of its mass has disappeared. This process has been known to take several decades to complete.
  * SCP-4800-A1 will reopen.

After SCP-4800, the resulting timeline will have elements of both instances of SCP-4800-A's histories. Events that the two timelines have in common will remain intact and not repeat[1](javascript:;); however, individual elements[2](javascript:;) will be included in the resulting timeline. No evidence of SCP-4800-related phenomena have been preserved; it is believed that SCP-4800 reverses the timeline to the beginning of the phenomena[3](javascript:;).
SCP-4800 will generally target timelines with less than [43°](/scp-3022) of difference. No other common factors have been discovered in SCP-4800's choice of target universe. The current timeline has been the subject of several SCP-4800 events, which have been catalogued in Addendum 02. It is estimated that over 3000 timelines in the LTG[4](javascript:;) are currently undergoing SCP-4800.
![meeting.jpg](https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-4800/meeting.jpg)
Meeting of representatives of the Multiversal Foundation Alliance to decide upon a consensus definition of SCP-4800. Sensitive information expunged.
**Addendum 01:** Discovery
SCP-4800 was first discovered after the Foundation was contacted by SCPF-7a5f7b[5](javascript:;) in early 1986. SCPF-7a5f7b had been observing our timeline's history, and shared information that proved that several new events were present that had not existed before 1986. It was also shared that our universe had been inaccessible to them for 23 years, and that these events began to exist after this period.
However, SCP-4800 was first observed by the Foundation after the development of DEEPWELL servers[6](javascript:;) in 1990. At this time, documents related to consensus world history were stored on DEEPWELL servers. Comparison between documents stored on DEEPWELL Server #987 and current consensus world history by AI construct ERIS.AIC revealed that several events had occurred that did not align with the past timeline. This, combined with evidence provided by SCPF-7a5f7b, led to the direct observation of E-5b0b3a and E-904ff2, two alternate timelines that were inaccessible for reasons unknown at the time. After the dissolution of E-904ff2 and the history modifications made to E-5b0b3a, SCP-4800 was classified.
**Addendum 02:** List of Known Occurrences of SCP-4800 in our timeline
Mainline Date | Description | Involved SCPs (if any)  
---|---|---  
1986 | Internal modifications to human evolution were made, resulting in increased susceptibility to image complexes and fractals for use as cognitohazards and memetic objects. | N/A  
1987 | Invention of the transistor in 1947, greatly advancing computation technology by several decades. | N/A  
1989 | The birth of Researcher Scranton and the invention of the Scranton Reality Anchor, Kant Counter, and other associated reality-alteration equipment. | N/A  
1992 | Creation of a North Asian civilization known as "the Daevite Empire". In addition, this also introduced several anomalous artifacts associated with the Daevites. | [SCP-140](/scp-140), [SCP-2140](/scp-2140), [SCP-3140](/scp-3140)  
1994 | Increased presence of a previously dead religion known as the "Church of the Broken God", as well as signs of its influence on modern religion. | [SCP-475](/scp-475), [SCP-882](/scp-882), [SCP-1139](/scp-1139)  
1995 | A rearrangement in the structure of the Foundation to include more focus on research, as well as the introduction of the "Thaumiel" object class. | N/A  
1996 | Increased use of technology developed by Robert Scranton. | N/A  
1997 | The origins of the Foundation are moved backwards from the early twentieth century to the seventeenth century, creating more Foundation influence on a global scale. | [SCP-2000](/scp-2000)  
2001 | Expansion of a Daevite cult known as Sarkicism into a global religion, as well as fallout from a past "Sarkic War". SCP-2000 is activated to reverse this damage; however, the presence of Sarkic cults and their conflict with the Church of the Broken God remain. | [SCP-2075](/scp-2075), [SCP-2406](/scp-2406), [SCP-2480](/scp-2480)  
2004 | Civilian discovery of faster-than-light technology after investigation of a crashed UFO. As per [Document 001-OMEGA](/wjs-proposal), information is disseminated stating that this technology is a hoax, and evidence of the technology is destroyed. | [SCP-3200](/scp-3200)  
2006 | Prolonging of the Cold War between the USSR and the USA after Joseph Stalin's death to 1990, as well as an increase in its intensity. | [SCP-2498](/scp-2498), [SCP-2664](/scp-2664)

**Addendum 03:** The SCP Foundation from universe E-909eaa has shared the following document with the Multi-U department. According to E-909eaa, the following document was encoded in a transmission that was sent from our timeline during an SCP-4800 event. It is unknown how this transmission managed to escape SCP-4800.
Footnotes
[1](javascript:;). For example, the formation of Earth or the evolution of _Homo sapiens_.
[2](javascript:;). Such as certain events or decisions.
[3](javascript:;). As a result, SCP-4800-affected timelines will lag behind other timelines. Due to the rate of SCP-4800 occurrence, this time difference will eventually equalize.
[4](javascript:;). Local Timeline Group
[5](javascript:;). Designation for an alternate timeline's version of the Foundation. SCPF-7a5f7b developed multiverse transversal technology earlier than the baseline Foundation, and was instrumental in accelerating the baseline Foundation's technology to allow for multiversal travel.
[6](javascript:;). DEEPWELL servers are specialized data storage servers that are able to preserve information across shifts in reality. They function by encoding their information on a two-dimensional object isolated into both of the temporal dimensions, rather than using hard-drives in the three spatial dimensions. A limitation of this is that DEEPWELL servers are unable to preserve limitations across temporal shifts; due to this, DEEPWELL servers can retain information about history prior to SCP-4800, but not events after SCP-4800 has begun.
