Thorley is in the kitchen washing dishes. Meanwhile, in the living room, Thorley is sitting on Thorley, who is sitting on their futon, watching Goncharov on their TV. Thorley is lying down next to them with their eyes closed.

Goncharov:

 "And one for the table!"

Thorley cheers. Thorley blows a raspberry on the back of their neck. Thorley giggles. Next to them, Thorley rolls over.

Thorley finishes washing the dishes and enters the living room.

Thorley notices Thorley sleeping and notifies Thorley and Thorley by indicating Thorley and making a shushing motion.

Thorley lowers the television volume.

Thorley grimaces, seeming to be experiencing a nightmare.

Thorley:

 

mumbling

 No more… no more bagels… no…

Thorley begins running their fingers through Thorley's hair.

Thorley's expression softens. They move closer to Thorley, rubbing their face against them and making a soft exhale noise before becoming stationary again.

Thorley quietly giggles. Thorley covers their mouth. Thorley walks over with a blanket and drapes it over Thorley, before sitting down in front of the futon to watch Goncharov. Thorley tussles their hair.

Thorley exits their bathroom wearing only a white towel.

As they enter their bedroom they see Thorley struggling to remove their bra.

Thorley seems embarrassed and tries to exit stealthily, knocking into a dresser.

Thorley turns around in the middle of undressing and sees Thorley. Thorley's face turns beet red.

Thorley:

 I'm so sorry! I thought this was my room! I'll uh, I'll leave.

Thorley:

 No, no it's okay! I get confused all the time! For all I know this might be your room, because…

Thorley and Thorley in unison:

 Because they all look alike.

Thorley nods.

Thorley:

 Because they're the same room.

Thorley nods

Thorley:

 Yep.

Thorley:

 Yep .

Thorley:

 I wonder why that is.

Thorley:

 I dunno.

Thorley silently stares at Thorley.

Thorley silently stares back.

Thorley:

 So, uh. What do we do here?

Thorley shrugs

Thorley:

 I dunno. I guess we could… share the bed?

Thorley grimaces and adjusts their towel.

Thorley:

 Or I could sleep on the couch that's fine too!

Thorley grabs Thorley's hand. Both hands are clammy.

Thorley:

 No, no, you're right, we should just split the bed. It'll be fine, haha!

Thorley:

 Oh good, because there's only the one couch.

Thorley:

 Yeah, except for the other one.

Thorley:

 Yeah.

Thorley begins to rummage in the closet for an outfit to change in to. Thorley continues to struggle with their bra. They turn back towards Thorley

Thorley:

 Hey. Um. This is embarrassing, but would you, uh, mind unhooking me?

Thorley turns around wearing a pikachu onesie, and looks shocked

Thorley:

 Um..

Thorley:

 It's nothing you haven't seen before!

Thorley:

 I guess? I. Just… turn around.

Thorley turns around. Thorley begins to undo the 

bra strap

The bra falls away.

Thorley turns around to reveal 

nothing.

Thorley:

 I sleep naked.

Silence is heard on the recording.

Thorley:

 Oh. I'm not sure what I sleep in or if I even sleep but this is all that was in the closet.

Thorley:

 It looks good on you.

Thorley:

 Thank you.

Thorley approaches.

Thorley:

 No, thank 

you

 for your help.

Thorley:

 With 

disposing of the body

?

Thorley:

 N— Oh was that you??

Thorley:

 

nodding

 I was the body, yeah.

Thorley makes an O face.

Thorley:

 That makes sense!

Thorley:

 Right?

Thorley nods.

Thorley nods.

Thorley suddenly kisses Thorley on the mouth.

Thorley jerks back.

Thorley:

 Wha—

Thorley seems embarassed.

Thorley:

 Oh. I'm sorry… I thought we were having a moment…

Thorley:

 No, no, I was having a moment. I just wasn't expecting that.

Thorley:

 Well, 

when at Site-43

Thorley:

 Ohhhhh, 

Canada
