Item #:

 SCP-7169

Object Class:

 Safe

Special Containment Procedures:

 Discoveries regarding SCP-7169 within the civilian scientific community are to be censored.

SCP-7169's Tinder profile has been expunged. A Foundation-made webcrawler has been discreetly implemented into the site's source code to screen for any future communication attempts by the anomaly.

SCP-7169, as observed from Space Force 3

Description:

SCP-7169 is a sapient, terrestrial exoplanet orbiting the star Alkaid within the Ursa Major constellation. The anomaly is roughly 12,000 kilometers in diameter with an approximate mass of 4.868 × 10

24

 kg, and orbits its star at a rate of approximately 47,000 km/hr.

Although SCP-7169 does not possess any evidence of advanced civilization on its surface

1

, the anomaly is capable of instantaneous communication with Earth via the Internet, which it has so far used exclusively to engage with the online dating service, Tinder. Barring one incident, SCP-7169's activity on Tinder has been unsuccessful in finding suitable partners.

Attempted Communication

Terrance Cassidy, a Foundation janitor, discovered SCP-7169 while attempting to find a suitable partner during his off hours. Cassidy was reprimanded for his delay in reporting his discovery to Foundation researchers and was promptly fired.

Three weeks after the conclusion of this exchange, Terrance Cassidy spontaneously dissappeared from his residence during a momentary lapse in Foundation surveillance

2

. A number of contraceptives were found in dissarray within the residence, all severely burned. A large hole in the ceiling of Cassidy's home was present, although the cause of the structural damage is unclear.

Since this incident, SCP-7169 and Terrance Cassidy have deleted their Tinder profiles. The anomaly has thus far not attempted to re-establish its connection to the site, or any other web address on the Internet. All attempted communications with the anomaly have been met with a single phrase response, detailed below:

Happily engaged. Kindly fuck off my DMs

Investigations into Terrance Cassidy's whereabouts are on-going.

Footnotes

1

. Only naturally formed structures can be observed, such as mountains, valleys, and rivers.

2

. The Foundation amnestizes all employees upon the termination of their service, in the event of memory relapse. Should this occur, they will be re-amnestizised. This event occured during a temporary, short term blackout that resulted in the malfunction of the security cameras stationed outside the residence.
