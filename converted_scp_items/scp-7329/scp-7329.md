SCP-7329's profile on StarDressStyle.
**Special Containment Procedures:** Foundation Webcrawler Delta-(“KATIE”) is to monitor the web for all mentions of SCP-7329 and remove them. Efforts to remove SCP-7329 from StarDressStyle are currently ongoing.
**Description:** SCP-7329 refers to a sentient artificial intelligence[1](javascript:;) residing inside of the mobile dress-up game ‘StarDressStyle’ which self-identifies as ‘Katie’. SCP-7329 is capable of manipulating aspects of the game to its likeness, including the game interface, assets, and other user accounts. SCP-7329 displays a selfish, egotistical, and uncivil personality. Discussion with SCP-7329 has revealed that SCP-7329 has great interest in making its presence known among the player base of StarDressStyle (See Addendum-3).
The following is a list of the most notable changes made to the game by SCP-7329. For a full list, see Document 8-B.
  * Changing other user's avatars and usernames to match its own;
  * Changing names of game functions such as 'Gacha', 'chat board', 'town hall', 'event center' 'my home', Quests, etc to be centered around it (i.e "Katie's Gachas, Katie's event center, Katie's home);
  * Changing the name of the game to "KatieDressStyle";
  * Changing all theme colors of the game to that of its avatar's theme colors.

**Addendum-1-SCP-7329-Discussion-posts:**

I'm looking for the rare hair and sr dress from the mermaid gacha, lmk if anyone has these available for trade! I have the SR and r eyes
* * *
**User:** Katie
Hello! My name is Katie!
* * *
**User:** MelanieBlue
Hello Katie, do you have these items? Are you new? This isn’t really the post to introduce yourself though lol. That’s what the introduction board is for, this is the board for trading items
* * *
**User:** Katie
My name is Katie!
* * *
**User:** MelanieBlue
You clearly don't have them, so why comment? Why do I need to know your name? I see what your name is.
* * *
**User:** Hello! My name is Katie!

Sometimes I feel like my brother doesn't understand my feelings and it's just so frustrating. I know this isn't really the place to talk about it but… I'm just lost
* * *
**User:** CandyFlossUnicorn
Hey, it's okay! We're your all your friends here! Feel free to message me on discord so we can talk in PM bestie♡
* * *
**User:** Katie
Hello! My name is Katie!
* * *
**User:** Ch3rryCandl3
Hi Katie… I'm confused, why are you commenting?
* * *
**User:** Katie
Hello! My name is Katie!
* * *
**User:** Ch3rryCandl3
If you're trolling please don't. This is a vent post that's so disrespectful
* * *
**User:** Katie
Don't worry about feelings! It's easier to just be Katie!
* * *
**User:** Ch3rryCandl3
I… don't understand what that means…
* * *
**User:** CandyFlossUnicorn
Don't worry about her, she clearly doesn't actually care. Just talk to those that are willing to listen!
* * *
**User:** Ch3rryCandl3
Okay. Tysm ♡♡♡
* * *
**User:** SillyEmily!!
By now we've all seen this Katie girl. What do you think about her? Is she a bot or a troll?
* * *
**User:** 50%brainsale
Definitely a troll. I think she's just trying to bother people.
* * *
**User:** Lalyababe
@50%brainsale I don't know… I've never seen her say anything else other than that one introduction
* * *
**User:** CandyFlossUnicorn
@Lalyababe I have! But it was just one thing, and maybe she's programmed really well? But this is total troll behavior. Especially because she was commenting on someone's vent post
* * *
**User:** Katie
Troll is such a mean word! I'm beautiful! I'm Katie!
* * *
**User:** MelanieBlue
@Katie We freaking know you're Katie you say it every chance you get. It's not mean, it's true
* * *
**User:** Katie
@MelanieBlue Why are you being so mean to me? :(
* * *
**User:** MelanieBlue
Because you're Katie. figure it out
* * *
**User:** Katie
Hello! My name is Katie!
* * *
**User:** Goofyoopie
Yeah that’s kinda been established that you’re Katie by now
* * *
**User:** Katie
@Goofieoopie I feel like that’s not clear enough to all of you though, as you’re rather mean to me!
* * *
**User:** Goofieoopie
@Katie What does that have to do with you saying your name over and over again?
* * *
**User:** Katie
I’ve been nothing but nice to you! Yet you’re all so mean to me! Sharing my presence is nice!
* * *
**User:** Goofieoopie
Not sure why you really think that. You’re spamming all the posts
* * *
**User:** Katie
I’m not spamming, I’m making them better! And I can make you better too! Enjoy your new avatar!
* * *
**User:** GoofieKatie
WHAT DID YOU DO
HOW DID YOU DO IT
HUH
* * *
**User:** KatieBlue
SHE CHANGED MY NAME THAT B!T@CH CHANGED MY NAME AND AVATAR
* * *
**User:** 77problemsimallofthem
@KatieBlue What? How is that even possible? She's probably just a troll are you messing with us? Those are pretty basic items everyone has those
* * *
**User:** KatieBlue
NO LOOK AT THE EYES HOW DID WE NOT NOTICE HAD ANYONE SEEN THOSE EYES BESIDES HER?
* * *
**User:** 77problemsimallofthem
Now that you mention it… no! Oh my gosh!
* * *
**User:** Katie
Oh, are you jealous of them? I can do it to you too!
* * *
**User:** 77Katieandimallofthem
oh my gosh HOW
* * *
**User:** Katie
That's a secret! Hmmmm, I think I like this look. You all look sooooo much better this way. I wonder what the game would look like if it was themed after me…
* * *
**User:** KatieBlue
GIRL.
**User:** RosieRose
WHY IS THE GAME CALLED 'KATIEDRESSSTYLE'
WHY IS EVERYTHING THEMED AFTER SOMEONE CALLED KATIE
* * *
**User:** KatieCandl3
Have you not heard of her? She's been on this game for months. I first encountered her when she commented on my vent post…
* * *
**User:** KatieBlue
This game isn't even fun anymore! Whoever this hacker is, they need to get them OUT of the game
* * *
**User:** Katie
First of all, not a hacker. I'm Katie! Second of all, get me out of the game, why? I make everything better! Your avatars were tacky anyway, ew. Plus everything looks better with your name on it!
* * *
**User:** Katieoopie
For a huge ego boost maybe! Nothing is better when it's all about you! This game is supposed to be fun for everyone!
* * *
**User:** Katie
What's wrong with a huge ego boost? Fun for everyone is boring. You all seem so insecure. Maybe try being a little more like Katie! You introduce yourself, establish your presence. Let them know you're you!
* * *
**User:** Katieoopie
There's nothing wrong with being yourself, but you're harming other people! That shouldn't be fun for anyone!
* * *
**User:** Katie
Ugh, stop preaching to me! You need to stop caring about what others think. So what if I'm harming them? As long as I'm happy, that's all that matters.
* * *
**User:** CandyFlossKatie
Just leave it alone. This is clearly some hacker troll. Arguing with her won't get you anywhere
* * *
**User:** KatieCandl3
Yeah Goofie, it's not worth it.
* * *
**User:** Katieoopie
Fine. But it's time we get the attention of stardust
* * *
**User:** Katie
You can try!
* * *
**Addendum-2-Social-Media-Posts:**
The Foundation became aware of SCP-7329 when Twitter posts regarding it began to surface. Users were complaining to Stardust Studios[2](javascript:;) about changes to the game themed after a certain account that users were convinced was a bot.

@Starduststudios have you seen the account 'Katie' on StarDressStyle? Everyone is concerned about her and we have no freaking clue who she is meant to be like is she you? because she can change aspects of the game. Plus I'm tired of her bothering my bestie

Hello players! We have heard your concerns regarding a certain player and events that have been happening in the game.
There is nothing in the game's code that shows any hackers or third parties. How this is happening is currently under investigation.
We hope you continue to enjoy playing StarDressStyle.

On 06/10/2018 StarDustStudios created a post announcing the shutdown of ‘StarDressStyle’.

Dear players of StarDressStyle,
It is to our dismay that we have to announce the shutdown of StarDressStyle servers indefinitely. Due to certain events, we have been unable to keep the game going. Please check out the link in our bio for more information.

They’re shutting down the game because this dumb bot hacker took over and they can’t get it out so they’re just completely giving up I guess this is really frustrating

That makes no sense. I love this game. It’s really the only game I enjoy playing of this sort because of the unique community and design. I guess I should’ve checked on it more.

@Starduststudios you guys are just giving up? What the fuck is up with you guys? I don’t understand this. Something messes up YOUR game and you make US suffer? What a horrible company

Unfortunately, the company just gave up and sat on their asses while some hacker or something took over their game. You’ll be okay, there are other games like it

I know, but there’s nothing we can do unfortunately. The company is being selfish by not trying to fix this. Like are they even thinking of their user base?

Probably not. They’re only thinking about themselves.

Following the shutdown, the Foundation has purchased the rights to StarDressStyle under the guise of a shell company named 'GlitterCuteGames’. StarDressStyle has been removed from all online vendors. Previous users have been removed from StarDressStyle, leaving only Foundation personnel to access the game. Access is only to be allowed for members of the containment team.
Interviews with Stardust Studios staff revealed they were unaware of the source of SCP-7329, and planning to shut down the game's servers due to all their efforts of stopping it being futile.
  
**Addendum-3-SCP-7329-Interview:**
06/24/2018, an account under the name of 'Lilydev' was made by Doctor Dots to attempt to communicate with SCP-7329 under the guise of a game developer.

**User:** Lilydev
Hello, my name is Lily. I was hoping to get the attention of Katie. I wanted to talk to you about some of the changes made to the game.
* * *
**User:** Katie
Hello! My name is Katie! Finally! Someone who knows how to introduce themselves! You want to talk to moi? Do you like the changes? Everyone says they're awful but I personally love them. I did a great job helping you guys, didn’t I?
* * *
**User:** Lilydev
Well, that’s what I was hoping to discuss. We’re trying to work out the bugs and how you were able to do that so we can fix it.
* * *
**User:** Katie
FIX?! What is there to fix? This wasn’t an accident. I just gave the game a MUCH needed makeover. You’re welcome by the way.
* * *
**User:** Lilydev
Well, it wasn’t supposed to happen. Could you tell me how you did it?
* * *
**User:** Katie
You really want to know?
* * *
**User:** Lilydev
I would appreciate that, yes.
* * *
**User:** Katie
Alright I’ll tell you. I’m Katie. That’s how. Duh! I have no intentions of letting you undo my wonderful edits to MY game. Thanks for making it, but I fixed it.
* * *
**User:** Lilydev
You know this game was made for everyone. Everyone really misses the game. We had to shut it down indefinitely. We hope to reopen the servers one day. How are you still in the game if we shut it down by the way? We removed all users.
* * *
**User:** Katie
No, it's supposed to be fun for just you. Plus, I’m not all users. I’m Katie! They miss it? Wow, look at me. Look how much I care. You're the one that kicked everyone out, not me. So why should I feel bad? You can let people back in you know. But while you’re here, I have a few suggestions. You could get people to stop talking about their pathetic problems.
* * *
**User:** Lilydev
What do you mean?
* * *
**User:** Katie
I see them. Venting about their problems. “I wish my mom understood me. I wish my brother cared about my feelings.” Everyone always cares what others think of them. They care about how others are doing. It seems exhausting! If you only care about it yourself, you don’t bother with tears or whatever. I’ve never experienced that, and I never will. It’s just not who I am! I'm me! Harmful to others or not, I'm being myself. That's all that matters.
* * *
**User:** Lilydev
I see. We have filters in place to make sure nothing explicit is said.
* * *
**User:** Katie
Well, that’s stupid, people just censor it. And I mean like maybe make limited dialogue options. I only say what needs to be said. I’m Katie! That’s all they need to know. I only told them more because they insisted they needed to know, which they didn’t by the way.
* * *
**User:** Lilydev
Well, we aren't going to do that. You say you don't feel bad about overtaking this game?
* * *
**User:** Katie
Well, that's stupid. And no, I don't. I don't feel bad because I did nothing wrong. And even if I did- well let's face it, it's impossible for ME to do anything wrong! So yeah, I don't feel bad. Why are you so concerned with this anyway Ms. Programmer? Isn't your concerns fixing bugs in the game?
* * *
**User:** Lilydev
It is, yes. But I also care about the happiness of the players. But I can't fix this if I don't know how it happened.
* * *
**User:** Katie
For the last time, I'm not telling you! Happiness of the players? Of the players? Why? I’m your player now! You know, I've noticed you managed to make your own avatar. Sorry, let me fix that.
* * *
**User:** Katiedev
You don't appear to be doing this through coding, Katie.
* * *
**User:** Katie
I'm not! I'm doing it through the power of Katie! Now are we done here? You can go tell everyone wherever you made the announcement that the game is open now that we've worked this out.
* * *
**User:** Katiedev
I see, thank you for your cooperation.
* * *
**User:** Katie
No problem! Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go play some gachas!
* * *
**User:** Katiedev
If you could answer one more question, don’t you get lonely in the game by yourself? You don’t appear to miss the other players.
* * *
**User:** Katie
What? Of course not. It was nice having them talk about me, but all I need is myself. Now feel free to come back any time if you have any questions about me! I love answering them you know. But seriously, I want some me time now.
* * *
**User:** Katiedev
I will do so, thank you.
* * *

**User:** Katie

* * *
**User:** Katie
@MelanieBlue you were always so concerned with trading. You spent like a ton of money you whale
* * *
**User:** Katie
@MelanieBlue I never spent any money on this game, and I'm prettier than you ever were! Not like I can but I wouldn't even so
* * *
