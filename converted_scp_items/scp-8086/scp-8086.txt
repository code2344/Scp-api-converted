Item #:

 SCP-8086

Object Class:

 Keter

Special Containment Procedures:

 SCP-8086 is currently uncontained.

Current Foundation containment efforts mainly center around keeping SCP-8086 away from major population centers.

The Demonic Department, Foundation Mobile Air Force, and the Department of External Affairs are cooperating to discover a method to either contain or neutralize SCP-8086.

Description:

 SCP-8086 refers to the Mobile Task Wing Kappa-15 of the 

Foundation Mobile Air Force

.

SCP-8086 consists of 15 planes, hereafter referred to as SCP-8086-A instances, designed for combat against hostile Groups of Interest.

1

While initially under the control and ownership of the Foundation, SCP-8086 is now piloted by several Class C Demonic Entities, hereafter referred to as SCP-8086-

󱥽

 instances.

Addendum 1:

 History

SCP-8086 was initially founded in 2004. While no other anomalous organization had a substantial aerial presence, SCP-8086 was created preemptively.

An SCP-8086-1 instance.

Several anomalous technologies were used in SCP-8086's construction to strengthen it. Among these was SCP-8086's weaponry, hereafter referred to as SCP-8086-1, which was purchased from 

Hunter Industries

.

2

Initial testing revealed that SCP-8086-1 instances were substantially more effective than nearly every mundane alternative, as well as many more expensive anomalous alternatives.

SCP-8086's anomalous properties emerged approximately two months after the SCP-8086-1 instances were installed. (See Addendum 2)

Addendum 3:

 Meeting Transcription

As Dr. Maslov T. Manferd had recently manifested back into baseline reality and due to his knowledge of other universal planes, he was brought on to the SCP-8086 research team. The following is a meeting between him, the Senior Commander of MTW Kappa-15, and Foundation Mobile Air Force's Operations Commander.

Involved Personnel:

Dr. Maslov T. Manferd, SCP Foundation Site-470

Sr. Comdr Amélie Loguidice, MTW Kappa-15

Ops. Comdr Amadeus F. Kayser, Foundation Mobile Air Force

[BEGIN LOG]

Sr. Comdr Loguidice and Ops. Comdr Kayser are both sitting on opposite ends of the table. Kayser glares at Loguidice for a moment before sighing and looking away. Loguidice is looking at her lap.

Both look towards the doorway as Dr. Manferd enters the room, holding several folders. He pulls a chair out and sits down.

Manferd:

 Hey guys, sorry I'm late. Traffic was a nightmare.

Manferd:

 (

claps his hands together

) So!

He turns and stares at Loguidice as his expression falls.

Manferd:

 Mind telling me exactly why you decided to purchase weaponry from an organization with a reputation for trying to trick us?

Kayser chuckles.

Kayser:

 This'll be good.

Manferd shoots a glance at Kayser before returning his gaze towards Loguidice and tilting his head slightly.

Loguidice:

 Okay, 

technically

 I did not buy the guns from Hunter Industries. I bought the guns from someone else who bought them from Hunter Industries.

Manferd:

 That's not really much better. Regardless, you should have— hold on.

Manferd rummages through one of the folders before taking out a packet.

Manferd:

 Did you even look over this agreement you signed? Look, it says right here—

Manferd:

 (

pauses

) Huh. Okay… admittedly there's not much that's incriminating here.

Loguidice:

 See! How was I supposed to know?

Manferd flips through pages before he pauses and raises an eyebrow.

Manferd:

 Wait, hold on. What's this?

Manferd detaches a sticky note, which is digitally recreated below, from the page and unfolds it, reading it out loud.

WARNING: The purchased guns have a 

slight

 problem where constant usage allows for demon spirits to emerge! Hunter Industries didn't do enough stress testing, it seems.

You're welcome for the warning!

Love,

Manferd buries his face in his hands as Kayser begins laughing.

Manferd:

 

Right

, you mean to tell me you supposedly looked over this whole packet and you didn't notice a sticky note?

Manferd:

 It doesn't even say who it's by, it just says "love". Who am I meant to feel loved by, hmm? Not you, clearly, as you seemingly don't love any of us here enough to look over the manual given for anomalous weaponry.

Manferd turns to face Kayser.

Manferd:

 And you're not off the hook either, so you can quit your cackling. As operations commander, you outrank her, so you really should've, at the very least, looked over her proposal for the weaponry. It's your responsibility to make sure everything in the Air Force runs smoothly.

Kayser:

 Well—

Manferd holds his hand up.

Manferd:

 Look, we've done enough bickering. The privilege to keep doin' that belongs to your direct supervisors. What I'm here to do is to help come up with a solution to our SCP-8086 problem.

Kayser:

 Surely we can just shoot them down? We do it over an unpopulated area, no harm no foul, right?

Loguidice clears her throat.

Loguidice:

 Actually, uh, that's not an option.

Kayser:

 And why is that?

Loguidice:

 I did some digging after SCP-8086 began exhibiting anomalous properties. Apparently 

we can't intervene in the case of Hunter Industries and its interests.

Manferd:

 Well, some research is better than none, but she 

is

 correct.

Kayser:

 What? Why?

Manferd:

 Some Site Director a while back was really dumb and got hypnotized and tricked into signing a blood pact.

Kayser:

 Ugh, okay. So, if we can't do anything, then how are we supposed to do something about SCP-8086?

Manferd:

 

We

 can't do something, but that doesn't mean that someone else can't do something for us.

[END LOG]

Addendum 4:

 List of Proposed Organizations

The following is a collection of various Foundation-allied/aligned organizations that were considered for aid in containing SCP-8086.

Organization Name:

 Global Occult Coalition

Organization Description:

 An arm of the United Nations and a major player in the anomalous world. Is more willing to outright destroy anomalous threats to normalcy.

Final Decision:

 Denied.

Note:

 We don't need an anomalous Washington Naval Treaty.

3

Organization Name:

 Wilson's Wildlife Solutions

Organization Description:

 An anomalous wildlife service centered around Boring, Oregon. Has an agreement with the Foundation to handle Safe and Euclid Class fauna-based anomalous in the region.

Final Decision:

 Denied.

Note:

 You guys are lucky that these submission forms are anonymous. Unfortunately for us, Tim can't send an army of pigeons to fight SCP-8086.

Organization Name:

 Goldbaker-Reinz Ltd.

Organization Description:

 A member of the GOC's Council of 108 and also the foremost insurance provider for the anomalous world. Has a number of outstanding contracts with the Foundation.

Final Decision:

 Approved.

Note:

 Unfortunately, they looked over the specifics of the blood pact and there isn't a legal loophole that we haven't tried already. Fortunately, getting someone else to act on our behalf 

is

 an available loophole.

Organization Name:

 SCP Foundation, Site-666

Organization Description:

 A Foundation site that lies within Undervegas, a city within the Fourth Circle of Hell. It primarily deals with the Tartarean entities within the region, also known as demons.

Final Decision:

 Approved.

Note:

 We sent them the documentation and they rejected us, saying something about how "these are a different kind of demon" or something.

Organization Name:

 Unusual Incidents Unit

Organization Description:

 The occult branch of the United States Federal Bureau of Investigations. Has a collaboration treaty with various anomalous organizations, including the Foundation, in the Southern United States.

Final Decision:

 Denied.

Note:

 The chances that we can guide SCP-8086 towards the Southern United States without being shot down first is minuscule. Similarly to the Coalition, we don't want them trying to make it so that we can't expand our air force more than necessary. Perhaps we need to expand our horizons on this search.

Organization Name:

 

Imperial Institute of Paranatural and Esoteric Study (IIPES)

Organization Description:

 The national normalcy organization of the Third Antarctic Empire located within SCP-1483. Its alliance with the Foundation is tenuous at best and is more akin to tolerance.

Final Decision:

 Denied.

Note:

 Not only will it be impossible to get the IIPES's aircraft out of the cave portal, but SCP-8086 vastly outperforms anything they can get in the air. Besides, they probably wouldn't help anyway. Regardless, I like where your head is at.

Organization Name:

 

Zhujihui

Organization Description:

 The successors to the Foundation in SCP-CN-1997.

4

 It is also a strong ally to the Foundation.

Final Decision:

 Approved

Note:

 Just who we need.

Addendum 5:

 Meeting between Dr. Maslov T. Manferd and Esteemed Scholar Mea Scarlet

Due to Dr. Manferd's personal ties with Esteemed Scholar Mea Scarlet of the Zhujihui, he was chosen to negotiate their aid with SCP-8086.

Involved Personnel:

Dr Maslov T. Manferd, SCP Foundation Site-470

Esteemed Scholar Mea Scarlet, Zhujihui

Dr. Manferd sits in the corner of a 

Hong Shing

 coffee shop, The Phases' Brew. He looks down at his watch before looking back up, smiling as he sees Es. Sch. Scarlet enter the building. He sits down across from Manferd.

Scarlet:

 Maslov! What a pleasure it is to see you.

Manferd:

 It's nice to see you too. Unfortunately, I'm here on official business today.

Manferd takes a folder out of his bag and slides it across the table.

Manferd:

 Through a series of unfortunate events, we've got some possessed planes we're not allowed to directly interfere with. That's where you guys come in.

Scarlet picks up the folder and begins looking through the pages inside it.

Manferd:

 I was hoping that you guys could send some aircraft to duke it out with 'em. Some wyvern-ships would work wonders. Dunno if they'd fit but maybe you can get them through the 

Rumsey Line

?

Scarlet flips to another page.

Scarlet:

 I believe that X Chamber of Commerce

5

 set up a Way in the water around Hong Shing. If it's big enough to fit container ships, it should be able to fit some wyvern-ships and dragon-ships.

Manferd:

 So you'll help?

Scarlet:

 Ah, not me specifically. I've got some 

Zhujihui business to take care of in Proy Bria.

 Regardless, I'll try and get a task force sent out.

Manferd:

 Thank you! You're a real lifesaver.

Scarlet:

 Say, while you're here, some friends and I were gonna take a trip to Bong Shing.

6

 Would you want to come along?

Manferd:

 Appreciate the offer, but I'm okay, thank you.

Several days after this meeting, the Zhujihui sent its Omega-31 Task Force to intercept SCP-8086 as it was flying above an uninhabited portion of Siberia. After a several-minute-long dogfight, Omega-31 emerged victorious, only suffering the loss of one wyvern-ship. Reclassification of SCP-8086 to Neutralized is ongoing.

Afterward, several Mobile Task Force squads were dispatched to recover the wreckage. All aircraft were recovered, except for two SCP-8086-A instances and Omega-31's wyvern-ship.

It is currently unknown where these aircraft are and how they disappeared, as the closest inhabited settlement to the crash site is 250 km away.
