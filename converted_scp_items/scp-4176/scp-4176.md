Objects recovered from an SCP-4176 event.
**Item #:** SCP-4176
**Object Class:** Keter
**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4176 events are to be prefaced to the civilian population as arms tests. Foundation agents planted in Adna are to administer amnestics upon an SCP-4176 event.
Objects found produced from SCP-4176 events are to be used as Foundation assets.
**Description:** SCP-4176 is a yearly reoccurring phenomenon affecting the Adna Post Office in Adna, Washington, typically occurring within the last week of January.
SCP-4176 events begin with the sudden launching of an unmarked, customized ICBM in the Pacific Ocean[1](javascript:;). Upon launch, the missile will be directed towards the unincorporated territory of Adna, WA, and land in the field in front of the area's post office. No civilians have been harmed as a result of an SCP-4176 event.
All missiles involved in SCP-4176 events feature secured hatches, with the phrases "taxes for (year) fiscal year" and "to: internal revenue(sic)[2](javascript:;) service, washington usa" spray-painted across the surface. The contents within the hatch are typically objects possessing large monetary value such as precious jewels, paintings, and other similar items.
