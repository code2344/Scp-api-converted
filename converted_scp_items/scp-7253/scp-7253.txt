Description:

 SCP-7253 refers to an unmarked hallway in the Attica Correctional Facility, New York. The hallway contains 16 cells, 5 of whom show signs of past habitation, and a single interrogation room.

 All cells contain a bed with a mattress, a sink and a porcelain toilet. Personnel entering one of the 5 cells or the interrogation room report a multitude of psychological and physical effects with no clear source. All effects cease after exiting the cells.

SCP-7253 has a secondary anti-amnestic effect, preventing personnel who have perceived the contents of the cells or the interrogation room from forgetting them.

The entrance was found between a collection of steel cabinets in the office of the prison's current warden. At the time, SCP-7253 was isolated by a reinforced steel door with a brass plaque bearing the logo of the SCP Foundation, in addition to an unknown label

. An exploration of SCP-7253 was conducted the following day.

SCP-7253-B was discovered 2 months later during repairs of a burst pipe near the northern wall of the ACF.
