Where it was found.
**Item #:** SCP-####[1](javascript:;)
**Object Class:** Pending[2](javascript:;)
**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-#### is contained within a Standard Humanoid Containment Cell somewhere in Site-433. You should only enter the chamber if you have a biohazard suit on.
Tears emitted by SCP-#### are cleaned with a vacuum cleaner. Eye contact is not to be made with the anomaly during this time, neither is speaking.
SCP-#### is to be interviewed every month, except when the interviewer forgets to interview SCP-####.[3](javascript:;)
Don't mess around with the tears that SCP-#### emits. Just pour them into the anomalous waste bin, otherwise I'm pretty sure you'll be at risk of becoming an SCP-####-1 instance, and we'd rather not deal with that.[4](javascript:;)
That's all I think?
**Description:** SCP-#### is a really sad man. It's stout, blue colored, has a bulbous nose, and it only wears shoes.[5](javascript:;) One of the most noticeable features of SCP-#### is that it doesn't even look like it's there. It looks like a drawing in real life.[6](javascript:;) It doesn't look like you'd be able to touch its icky, spongy, saltwater skin. But you can.[7](javascript:;)
It is not of interest, this is the main anomaly. It is very difficult to speak, write, or interact with SCP-#### in a way that isn't half-hearted. This is why we're doing it like this, it is genuinely hard to express any emotion towards it in a genuine fashion.[8](javascript:;) I dunno what term we even use for this sort of thing and I don't really want to look it up right now, I am so tired.[9](javascript:;)[10](javascript:;)[11](javascript:;)
SCP-#### is always crying because it is a sad man. Voice sounds like if an actor didn't know what accent they were doing so they just did whatever they could come up with.[12](javascript:;)It is always in this constant state of misery and woe and it can't really explain why, even when we ask as nicely as we can.[13](javascript:;)
SCP-####'s constant crying has become an issue, as its tears are anomalous and have an effect. They're light blue, appear similar to how it looks,[14](javascript:;) and when cleaned the tears leave behind a shiny stain. The anomaly of the tear fluid happens when you get it on your skin.[15](javascript:;)
People who get the tears anywhere on their skin will start becoming a thing called SCP-####-1. The process is poorly understood cause most people viewing someone turning into a -1 were uncomfortable and looked away.[16](javascript:;) These SCP-####-1 are similar to SCP-#### except for the fact they are shaped different, resembling a pitiful version of the person affected.
When multiple are around, SCP-####-1 are often seen attempting to comfort each other.[17](javascript:;) They are all really sad, just like SCP-####. Despite the fact that all SCP-####-1 were formerly human, it's still hard to interact with them in earnest.[18](javascript:;)
SCP-#### was discovered in the home of a guy named Fred Johnson after reports of crying in his house. There was a lack of anything in the home.[19](javascript:;) SCP-#### was discovered and taken to Site-433. Fred Johnson is missing.

**Conversation:** We decided to get someone to talk to it.
**Interviewer:** D-1711[20](javascript:;)
**Interviewee:** SCP-####
**Note:** A researcher[21](javascript:;) wrote questions on a napkin for the D-Class to read out to the thing. There were four questions in total.

**(** start log**)**
**D-1711:** This suit is stuffy. How the hell am I gonna read my notes in this thing?
_Researcher sighs._
**Researcher:** Please enter the chamber, I do not have time for complaints.
**D-1711:** Hey, I'm doing you all a favor here! I have every r-
**Researcher:** You say that like you have a choice.
**D-1711:** I— I know, it's just… you don't understand! It's different! I— you…
**Researcher:** Enter the chamber.
**D-1711:** Okay.
_D-1711 enters SCP-####'s chamber. SCP-#### is crying in a fetal position, his face casted downwards. Puddles of shimmering tears coat the floor. D-1711 appears nauseous._
**D-1711:** Why is it so damn hot in here? Did you guys forget to leave the air conditioning on or something?
**Researcher:** Oh. Uhh, yeah. I guess we did.
**D-1711:** Wait, for real?
_D-1711 laughs._
**D-1711:** I was just joking! Maybe that's what has this thing crying. Christ, are those… tears all over the floor? Aren't you supposed to clean af-
**Researcher:** Listen, just ask the damn thing those questions on your napkin, alright?
**D-1711:** Jesus, alright man. Lighten up a little.
_SCP-#### looks up at D-1711, face damp with sweat and tears. D-1711 recoils in surprise._
**SCP-####:** How?
**D-1711:** Oh, I wasn't talking to you. Uhh, anyway, I need to ask you some questions.
_SCP-#### snivels._
**SCP-####:** You won't be able to get it. It's not even here.
_D-1711 holds the napkin up to his face, squinting his eyes to view the questions._
**D-1711:** Okay, here we go. Question number one, how are you feeling?
_SCP-#### stops crying for a moment, appearing bewildered._
**SCP-####:** Huh?
**D-1711:** Should I repeat the question?
**SCP-####:** No, you're fine. It's just… I thought it was apparent… am I not…
**D-1711:** You feel sad, right? I understand.
_SCP-#### begins to weep. D-1711 anxiously sways his arms back and forth rhythmically._
**SCP-####:** That's what everyone's going to understand about me now, isn't it? Here I was hoping for once that… I don't fucking know. I don't know! I don't even know! _It's not that far ahead!_
_SCP-#### has a tantrum, throwing its own body onto the walls of its containment cell until tiring itself out and lying on the floor. D-1711's body language during this expresses discomfort and fear._
**D-1711:** Shit.
**SCP-####:** Just leave me alone. Get the questions over with and go away! This won't work! This won't change anything. You aren't even near the root of it.
**D-1711:** Okay, I will continue. Question number two, why are you like this?
_SCP-#### winces._
**SCP-####:** I don't kn—
_SCP-#### clasps its hands over its mouth, screaming._
**SCP-####:** Is that all I can fucking say? I- I'll just tell you the best I can, okay? Okay! So, I was me, okay? I was just myself. My name was Fred Johnson. _Okay?_ And I was just in my house. I was doing something there. I was doing Fred Johnson shit, y'know. Just doing something I'd do. I don't know what the _fuck_ that would be, but I was doing it.
**SCP-####:** And that's when I felt it. Like something invisible rubbing against my body. It was like sandpaper. It scraped and scratched against the outside and inside. I closed my eyes before I could see what it was doing to me, but before I did, I saw the room I was in fizzing and scraping itself into pieces.
**SCP-####:** It hurt, and I wasn't Fred Johnson.
**D-1711:** Oh. Is that the reason you're sad?
_SCP-#### laughs, screams, and blubbers for about a minute._
**SCP-####:** No.
**D-1711:** Okay. I- I'll try and… I'm… you don't have to… it's… oh…
_D-1711 stands silent for 24 seconds._
**D-1711:** Question number three, why do your tears change people?
**SCP-####:** I think it's the only way.
**D-1711:** The only way to… what exactly?
**SCP-####:** I don't know.
**D-1711:** Alright.
_Silence for around 20 seconds._
**D-1711:** Next question. Question number four…
_D-1711's eyes appear to widen._
**D-1711:** What the _fuck?_ No. I'm not fucking saying this. Who the hell wrote this?
_Researcher speaks through the door of the chamber, muffled._
**Researcher:** Please comply with the experiment.
**D-1711:** You wrote this, didn't you?
_Researcher sighs._
**Researcher:** Y'know what? Fuck it. We're getting nowhere with this. I'm opening the door.
**D-1711:** Sick fuck.
**(** end log**)**
Researcher was reprimanded for the fourth question he wrote.[22](javascript:;)
