Item #:

 SCP-6978

Object Class:

 Neutralized

Special Containment Procedures:

 Due to the further inability of SCP-6978 to enact changes, the anomaly is deemed as having lost its effect and is essentially neutralized. As a result, no Special Containment Procedures are necessary.

Description:

 SCP-6978 is a metaphysical mechanism affecting an alternative dimension designated as Exempla-117. The anomaly is able to replace properties describable by numbers of any existing entity within Exempla-117 with a mathematical concept designated as Instance-0.

The properties of Instance-0 are not fully known, but several traits have been discovered after experimentation.

Instance-0 is uncountable.

Instance-0 is greater than Aleph-Null.

Instance-0 cannot be described.

Further Research Summary

Close Addendum

Following the indirect neutralization of SCP-6978, as of 11th of March 2021 five additional anomalies similar to SCP-6978 were found in an alternate dimension.

All of those dimensions fulfil the standard necessary for "Exempla" classification, and by that are meant the following criteria:

Extremely high similarity in the current state of the planet Earth, including existing people, events, locations and objects.

Similarity of outcome of broadly defined high-dimensional/hyperreal structures and entities.

Proximity of actions of known groups and individuals to our reality; groups can be expected to act in similar ways to our universe counterparts.

It is unknown whether the discovery of all SCP-6978 instances occurred in Exempla universes due to specific traits of those realities, or whether it is a coincidence.

Recovered camera footage from the town shows the citizens suddenly vanishing at 3:27 AM, leaving only their clothes behind on the ground. The federal government claims to have no knowledge of why or how this event occurred and stated that an investigation was launched to determine those factors…
