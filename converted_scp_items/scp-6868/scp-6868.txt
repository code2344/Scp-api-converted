SCP-6868.

Special Containment Procedures:

 SCP-6868 is to be contained in a standard animate object containment unit at Site-228. All handling of SCP-6868 is to be performed while wearing gloves.

SCP-6868 is not to be brought near any liquids.

Description:

 SCP-6868 is an animate and sentient rubber duck toy, which is 9x9.5x8 cm large. On its bottom a stylized W has been printed in purple. SCP-6868 is able to maneuver itself slowly with small jumps.

Since recovery, SCP-6868 has refused all attempts at communication, hopping away from any personnel attempting to come near it. It has been determined that SCP-6868 has haphephobia.

Its main anomalous property is triggered upon physical contact with any liquid. SCP-6868 is able to transform liquid substances into purified water and pink soap bubbles. The bubbles then form small animate replicas of various types of ships, submarines, and airplanes, which then start to fly and sail autonomously. These bubbles are noted to be edible and taste similar to strawberries.

This anomalous property is capable of converting liquid to purified water at a speed of 5 liters per second. This process is automatic with SCP-6868 seemingly having no control over the effect. Once removed from the liquid, the conversion will immediately stop and all converted liquids show no further anomalous properties.

Addendum 6868-1: Discovery Log

During routine text message surveillance, a series of texts seemingly referring to an anomalous object led to the discovery of SCP-6868 in Klaus Heartz's personal effects. An excerpt of text messages between Klaus Heartz and Otto Knebel has been included below.
