Special Containment Procedures:

 As the nature of SCP-7617 has only been recently discovered by the Department of Metafictional Research, its containment procedures are still being drafted and are awaiting approval from Site-400's current site director.

Description:

 SCP-7617 is the designation given to Junior Researcher Francis Selakkan, of Site-400's Department of Mundane Artifacts and Uneventful Data Evaluation (MAUDE). SCP-7617 is a Caucasian adult male of British-Israeli descent, 161 centimeters in height with brown eyes and short black hair.

Throughout recent observations conducted by the Department of Metafictional Research, SCP-7617 has been shown to possess an extremely low amount of pataphysical involvement potential. While baseline individuals have around at least 2 to 5 DMRGs

1

, SCP-7617 seems to only possess a reading of -3 at the time of writing, which is extremely unusual and completely unlikely for personnel employed by the Foundation.

Essentially, this would mean that any and all developing narratives fundamentally avoid SCP-7617, as he doesn't have the required cynosure to be the focal point of a narrative. As such, he has, at the time of writing, successfully evaded being affected and/or killed by some external story-driven force.

Addendum 7617-1, Recognized Events:

 The following is a list of events compiled by the Department of Metafictional Research that may have been attributed to SCP-7617's anomalous properties:

Date & Time

Event Description

23/4/2018 (1:21 PM)

During a containment breach caused by an 

SCP-4310

 instance

2

, the West Wing of Site-400, which also houses the personal quarters, was put on indefinite lockdown. Unfortunately, most of the Foundation personnel who were present in the Wing were killed by the SCP-4310 instance. SCP-7617, who was also present in the West Wing, was asleep during the breach, and therefore did not exit his quarters and encounter SCP-4310

3

.

13/07/2019 (4:44 AM)

In the midst of a raid conducted by the Chaos Insurgency, SCP-7617 (along with his colleagues from MAUDE) evacuated their workstations as per protocol and attempted to lock themselves within a nearby emergency shelter. However, on his way to the shelter, SCP-7617 was accidentally struck on the head by a fallen pipeline, and was knocked unconscious. His aforementioned colleagues, not noticing his absence, did not retrieve SCP-7617 and proceeded to enter the shelter without him. Thankfully, when Insurgency operatives arrived where SCP-7617 had fallen unconscious, they did not acknowledge him and moved on, possibly thinking that he was already dead. As a result of this, SCP-7617 is one of the few individuals who survived the raid.

02/09/2019 (11:43 AM)

While an 

SCP-008

 containment outbreak

4

 was plaguing the entirety of Site-400, SCP-7617 was safe at home, recovering from a head injury he sustained from the previous Chaos Insurgency raid.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Addendum 7617-2, Incident Log:

 On December 7th, 2020, following ten seconds after the official posting of the above document to the SCiPnet server, SCP-7617, who was having lunch below an opened skylight roof in Site-400's main cafeteria, was struck by five consecutive lightning bolts and immediately died to internal burns and severe organ damage.

Analysis of SCP-7617's corpse revealed that it now possesses a DMRG reading of 1, and is consequently no longer considered anomalous. His remains were subsequently cremated and stored within Site-400's residential columbarium.

SCP-7617 has been reclassified to Neutralized as of this incident. Its main document will be updated shortly.

 

Footnotes

1

. 

DMRG:

 A unit of measurement used to calculate and give a rough quantification of an object's pataphysical involvement potential.

2

. SCP-4310 is an anomalous carnivorous species of centipede that possesses a total length (from head to anus) of approximately 6.5 meters.

3

. Later, SCP-7617 reported to on-site security that he was a very heavy sleeper, and thus did not overhear the alarm announcing the breach.

4

. SCP-008 is a complex prion, the information and research of which is highly classified.
