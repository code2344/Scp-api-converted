Everything is cake.

Item #:

 SCP-6161

Object Class:

 Safe

Special Containment Procedures:

 SCP-6161 is to be kept in a standard secure objects locker in 

Site-55

. It is unknown if the object's container has become an SCP-6161-1 instance, but this has been labeled acceptable. Personnel handling SCP-6161 are to only touch the object's hilt, avoiding the blade.

Description:

 SCP-6161 is a cake knife, measuring 23 cm in length and made of steel. When SCP-6161 is used to cut an object, it is capable of slicing through any material with ease. Objects cut by SCP-6161 will transform into instances of SCP-6161-1.

SCP-6161-1 instances will continue to exhibit baseline traits on their exterior, but their interiors consist entirely of cake. The cake within SCP-6161-1 instances has been reported to possess various different flavors.

Further testing with SCP-6161 has been restricted.

 

 

Footnotes

1

. Despite having a slice cut out of it, the wheel maintained its structural integrity and did not deflate.

2

. Despite being transformed into an SCP-6161-1 instance, the laptop continued to function until a slice was removed from it, at which point it shut down.

3

. X-rays performed after the transformation confirmed that Dr. Greene's insides are now entirely composed of cake. It is unknown how he is able to retain life functions in this state.
