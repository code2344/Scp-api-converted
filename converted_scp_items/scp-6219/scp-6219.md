Recreation of the logo carved onto Abnormality-6219's forehead.
**DESCRIPTION:** **Abnormality-6219** is the designation given to a hairless and grey-skinned humanoid cadaver approximately 2.5 meters in height. **Abnormality-6219** does not possess any reproductive organs or any facial features, and instead has a crude SCP Foundation logo carved into its forehead, with various degrees of burnt marks scattered throughout **Abnormality-6219** 's torso and arms. Although **Abnormality-6219** has been in Foundation possession since [DATA EXPUNGED], **Abnormality-6219** has not shown any signs of decay.
**Abnormality-6219** is a [Class-I Semiontological Anomaly](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5242).A semiontological anomaly (semiohazard) is a disruption of the Semiosphere (the medium through which information about reality travels before it is perceived or measured) which results in reality's apparent adherence to some non-real axiom. These types of anomalies are often handled by the [Department of Miscommunications (DoMC)](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/domc-hub).. Any subject mentioning **Abnormality-6219** , whether through speech or writing (as such in this document), will refer to **Abnormality-6219** as "Abnormality-6219"; instead of its proper SCP designation.
**Abnormality-6219** was discovered in a previously sealed-off underground room in Site-58 during a renovation to expand the West Wing of the facility. However, blueprint plans obtained from Site-58's archive shows no mention of the room ever being built.
The underground room contains only the following:
  * **Abnormality-6219** , lying on the ground with its hands rested on its chest,
  * A metal bucket full of an unidentified reddish liquid,
  * A metal placard reading "[Department of Abnormalities](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-3790)",
  * Multiple drawings depicting a forested region,
  * A long thin silver rod, approximately 1 meter in length,
  * A painted stone tablet depicting a flaming iron crown,
  * Two (2) golden-brown metal ingots of unknown composition,
  * A solid heavy metal door, currently inaccessible as the door's handle and unlocking mechanism was removed prior to discovery.

**INCIDENT LOG 1:** On █/█/███, the site containing **Abnormality-6219** experienced a total power failure, resulting in a massive blackout and multiple Euclid and Keter Class containment breaches.This containment breach resulted in 26 injured personnel and 14 casualties with 1 personnel reported to be missing.. During the blackout, personnel reported hearing soft crying and faint screaming emanating from **Abnormality-6219** 's containment chamber.
When the power was subsequently restored on the site, a D-Class was instructed to enter **Abnormality-6219** 's containment chamber to examine any structural damage. The D-Class reported nothing out of the ordinary but then noticed a note taped on the chest of **Abnormality-6219**. The note is written by a standard graphite pencil and has been designated **Document** -**Abnormality-6219****-1**.

No one will torture me,
My soul will not be in entropy,
Behind this mortal bone,
Is a sin you can never atone,
I hated the name you've given,
I would rather return to **the woods of the unspoken**.
The cause of the site-wide power failure is unknown inconclusive at this time.
