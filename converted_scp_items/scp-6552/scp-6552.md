SCP-6552.
**Item #:** SCP-6552
**Object Class:** Safe
**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-6552 is stored in Anomalous-Documents-Folder-47. All testing of SCP-6552 is discontinued and no one is to rename or play SCP-6552 under any circumstances.
**Description:** SCP-6552 is a .wav file consisting of the sounds of water crashing against the shore. When the file is given a name that creates a compound word when said while including the .wav and is played, a corresponding anomalous event will occur.
**Addendum 6552.1 Test Log:**  
Dr. Henderson instructed D-41897 on what to name SCP-6552. D-41897 then played the file for 3-10 loops and Dr. Henderson then marked down the effects.  
Name of SCP-6552 | Anomalous Event  
---|---  
sound.wav | The audio of SCP-6552 did not come out of the speakers hooked up to the computer used to play the audio. Instead emanating from the pixels making up the .wav file itself.  
heat.wav | The room in which SCP-6552 was being played began to heat up at a rate of 1°C per second.  
vapor.wav | While being played, all UI on the computer playing it was restructured to fit the "vaporwave" aesthetic.  
brain.wav | All personnel at Test-Site-98 were able to hear SCP-6552 being played, although no recording devices were able to register any sound.  
micro.wav | When played, concentrated radiation was emitted from the device playing SCP-6552 causing D-41897 to expire after 3 loops of the audio.  
tidal.wav | Flooding of Test-Site-98 caused notes on resultant anomalous effect unrecoverable. Reconstruction and transferring of new replacement staff to Test-Site-98 are underway.
