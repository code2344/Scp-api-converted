SCP-6552.

Item #:

 SCP-6552

Object Class:

 Safe

Special Containment Procedures:

 SCP-6552 is stored in Anomalous-Documents-Folder-47. All testing of SCP-6552 is discontinued and no one is to rename or play SCP-6552 under any circumstances.

Description:

 SCP-6552 is a .wav file consisting of the sounds of water crashing against the shore. When the file is given a name that creates a compound word when said while including the .wav and is played, a corresponding anomalous event will occur.

Addendum 6552.1 Test Log:

Dr. Henderson instructed D-41897 on what to name SCP-6552. D-41897 then played the file for 3-10 loops and Dr. Henderson then marked down the effects.
