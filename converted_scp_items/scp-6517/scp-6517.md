**Special Containment Procedure:** Due to the nature of the anomaly, traditional containment is currently impossible. The current containment protocols are only aimed at keeping public awareness of SCP-6517 outside the scope of the paranormal world. SCP-6517 will be monitored by Foundation-filed agents embedded in the French police and tourist guides. Any abnormal behaviors shown by SCP-6517 must be reported to the project research head immediately.
In the event that an SCP-6517-B instance appears in an urban area, field agents will be deployed to control and assess the situation. The Foundation's Department of External Affairs will work with the local government in the area where the SCP-6517-B instance has appeared to cover up the event with an appropriate story. This cover story will involve tourism purposes, allowing civilians to approach it as much as the circumstances permit.
Foundation web crawlers are to scan and remove any mentions regarding knowledge about SCP-6517 or its anomalous properties from the internet.
**Update:** Foundation agents are prohibited from engaging in aggressive or hostile actions against SCP-6517 or any of its instances to avoid provoking a hostile reaction from SCP-6517.

SCP-6517.
**Description:** SCP-6517 refers to the Eiffel Tower in Paris, France. It is unknown when or how the Eiffel Tower acquired its anomalous properties. The examination of the tower's original blueprints and construction records did not reveal the use of any anomalous materials or occult engineering in the structure. The analysis of samples taken from SCP-6517 revealed that the entire structure is composed of organic material of unknown origin, resembling metal in both appearance and composition.[1](javascript:;) The analysis also showed a match with the DNA profile of **[REDACTED]** , though the tests were inconclusive.
SCP-6517 possesses a network of metallic roots that extend underground through the tower's four bases and continue to grow and expand in a manner similar to non-anomalous tree roots. The total length of these roots is unknown, but laser imaging has shown that they may extend at least 4 km deep underground and horizontally span to more than 80,000 km.[2](javascript:;) Often, these roots will begin to resurface and breach the earth in or near urban areas around the world, and will then start to grow in size and intertwine with each other. When this occurs, an instance of SCP-6517-B will be created.
SCP-6517-B are near-identical replicas of the Eiffel Tower. These replicas exhibit some deviations from the original tower, including but not limited to differences in size and height to decorative details, and can in shape range from a simplified version of SCP-6517 to an exact one-to-one replica. It was later discovered that SCP-6517-B instances emit a memetic effect that causes human viewers to ignore the abnormal and sudden appearance of the tower, leading them to believe that the tower has always existed in its current location.[3](javascript:;)
![Las%20Vigas](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-6517/Las%20Vigas)
SCP-6517-B-05 instance in Las Vegas.
Due to a notable increase in the frequency of SCP-6517-B instances creation since the 1980s, to the present day. Project researchers speculate the potential of an EFK-class end-of-world scenario. According to this theory, SCP-6517-B instances will proliferate rapidly in urban areas worldwide, concentrating in dense clusters. As a result, the growth of these structures will displace surrounding human infrastructure, eventually rendering civilian life within cities and urban zones impossible.

**Document-6517-06-023:** The following documents have been collected from Maurice Koechlin's memoirs, which are believed to be responsible for creating the Eiffel Tower's original blueprint.
07 May, 1884  

![blueprint](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-6517/blueprint)
Original Eiffel Tower blueprint that was found with journal. Drawn by Maurice Koechlin.
At last, after a protracted evening filled with much planning, erasure, and redrawing, I find myself in possession of the completed blueprint for the tower which Émile and I had so fervently discussed. Though the act of drafting the illustration itself proved manageable, it was the endeavor to distill our vision—so vast in scope—into a coherent and simplified design upon paper that proved most taxing. Since the announcement of the Exposition Universelle's grand design competition,[4](javascript:;) Émile and I have devoted many days in careful deliberation, determining precisely what concept we might submit for Monsieur Eiffel’s consideration. At length, our thoughts have coalesced, and we are resolved to pursue this model: a majestic pylon composed of four latticework girders, set apart broadly at their base and gracefully converging at their summit, all bound at intervals by stout metal trusses.  
  
  
Despite the confidence Émile and I share in the merits of our design, persuading Monsieur Eiffel presents an entirely different challenge. His firm stands among the most esteemed in the realm of architecture and engineering, with numerous triumphs of structural ingenuity bearing his name, both within France and abroad. As such, it would not astonish me in the least were Monsieur Eiffel to receive our preliminary concept with measured caution about the initial concept.
09 May, 1884  
  
We have already had the occasion to present our design for the tower to Monsieur Eiffel, and I must confess, I was quite unprepared for the genuine enthusiasm with which he received our initial proposal. This bodes well, indeed. Nevertheless, he was not wholly content with the draft I provided; he expressed a desire for greater ornamental refinement and suggested several enhancements before granting his full approval. Perhaps, with a bit of reflection and further discussion with Émile, I may devise some embellishments that shall meet with his expectations.  
  
18 May, 1884  
  
Several days past, Émile made an introduction to a gentleman by the name of Monsieur Jean Barsan. He informed me that Monsieur Barsan is an old acquaintance of his, a man of artistic inclination in the architectural realm, and one whom he believes may offer valuable suggestions for the tower’s external embellishments. While I am by no means opposed to the notion of another architect lending his artistic vision to our endeavor, I must admit that there is something in Monsieur Barsan’s manner that unsettles me. His smile alone imparts a peculiar unease, though I can scarcely say why. I would not wish to appear discourteous in the presence of Émile’s friend, and yet I cannot entirely dismiss this inexplicable disquiet. He seems, on the whole, a most agreeable fellow—no doubt it is merely my nerves, frayed as they are by the weight of our undertaking.  
  
  
It has succeeded! Monsieur Barsan contributed a series of decorative arches to the base, a graceful glass pavilion upon the first level, and crowned the entire structure with an elegant cupola. Evidently, these enhancements sufficed to satisfy Monsieur Eiffel, for he has at last granted his approval. The patent has been secured, and all proceeds apace with remarkable smoothness. In retrospect, it would seem my earlier misgivings were nothing more than the result of an overtaxed mind—anxieties born, no doubt, from the magnitude of the tower itself.
15 February, 1888  
  
This is, without question, a most grievous day for the realm of modern architecture. Today, we received the somber news that Monsieur Eiffel, in the aftermath of the trial concerning the Panama affair, has tendered his resignation as head of the company. Moreover, he has declared his intention to sever all association with the institutions that bear his distinguished name. In the same hour, I was notified by telegram of my appointment as Director of Management. If nothing else, I shall endeavor to see that the tower is brought to completion in accordance with our original vision.  
  
Later this evening, as I encountered Monsieur Barsan at the construction site, he remarked, “It is indeed unfortunate to lose a colleague of Gustave’s experience and creative prowess, but one cannot continue flogging a dead horse. After all, the French Empire was not forged without the sacrifice of valiant souls, all in the service of spreading our noble ideals.” While I do not question Jean’s fervent commitment to our enterprise, I confess that his ardent patriotism, admirable though it may be, appears at times to cloud his judgment. I struggle to perceive how Monsieur Eiffel’s resignation might be construed as a boon to our cause; on the contrary, it serves only to heighten the difficulty of the task that lies ahead.
31 March, 1889  
  
The long-awaited day has at last arrived. I pen these words as I stand before the tower—our tower—after years of tireless labor, aspiration, and anticipation. The Exposition of 1889 now bears witness to what I believe to be the crowning achievement of French architecture. This colossal structure, rising to a height of 300 meters, now dominates the very heart of the capital, just as I once dared to imagine. I pay no mind to the discontented murmurings of those envious detractors whose designs fell by the wayside; criticism, after all, is a far easier pursuit than creation. “I’m glad the view of the capital from the top was worth all the effort,” Émile remarked as we stood together at the summit. As we began our descent, Jean chose to linger a while longer upon the heights—and truly, I cannot fault him for wishing to remain a little longer in the company of such magnificence.  
  
  
  
15 May, 1889  
  
It has now been approximately a week since the grand commencement of the Exposition here in Paris, during which we have received a multitude of esteemed guests and dignitaries. And yet, I cannot help but observe the conspicuous absence of Monsieur Barsan. Considering the fervor with which he embraced this project from its inception, it strikes me as most curious that he should forgo so momentous an occasion.
I have sought Émile’s counsel on the matter, and he continues to maintain that Jean is presently occupied with another commission beyond the borders of France and shall not be returning in the near future. Though this explanation may suffice on the surface, I confess that I remain uneasy. There is something in the circumstances which, I believe, merits closer attention.
  
  
  
**Document-6517-10-056:** The following documents have been collected from Emile Nouguier's personal constructions record. 
The construction advances with commendable steadiness, and barring unforeseen difficulties, the tower ought to be completed within the next two years. Regrettably, I cannot say the same of the sphere. On numerous occasions, I have proffered my assistance to Jean, yet he remains resolute in managing the entirety of the work himself. Were it not for my familiarity with his character, I might be tempted to label him obstinate, perhaps even blame him for the ensuing delays. However, I recognize that his conduct springs not from selfishness, but from an uncompromising pursuit of perfection. His nature is meticulous to a fault. Nevertheless, I confess to a certain frustration at witnessing the project’s progress hampered when it might surely benefit from a more collaborative effort.
Jean has at long last completed his work upon the sphere, and I must confess it has exceeded even my own expectations. The sole task that remains is to bring it to life—to power it. For a fleeting moment, I harbored fears that we might be compelled to resort to some antiquated, almost barbaric rite, yet I was taken aback when Jean declared his intention to undertake this responsibility himself. He spoke with conviction that this project is the most consequential of his entire career, and for that reason alone, he feels the burden must rest squarely upon his own shoulders.
I made no attempt to dissuade him, fully aware that my entreaties would fall upon deaf ears. Jean has always exhibited a singular willingness to sacrifice greatly for the sake of his craft—a fact I have come to understand well, not least since our last enterprise in the city of Velmont.[5](javascript:;) Thus, whatever fate awaits, let it come.
  
  
  
**Document-6517-12-030:** The following documents have been collected from Thomas Edison's personal journal after his return from Paris. 
Today, after arriving in Paris, I had the opportunity to inspect Mr. Gustave Eiffel's tower during the Exposition. While I respect the engineering behind it—Eiffel is a clever man—I still maintain that the structure is a blemish on the skyline, resembling an unfinished power plant more than a monument.
However, the real event of the day was something I’ll not soon forget. I nearly lost my life. As I climbed the tower with Jimmy, we approached the edge of the platform to get a better view of the city. It was then that I stumbled on something, losing my balance. If Jimmy hadn’t grabbed me, I’d have been dashed to the ground below. When I turned back to see what had tripped me, I discovered it was a set of metal rods jutting from the platform’s surface. The oddest thing was that these rods hadn’t been there before, and for a moment, they resembled a human hand—before receding into the floor.
Now, I’m no fool, nor am I prone to flights of fancy. Jimmy saw it, too. But I’ve decided not to speak of this to anyone. My work is rooted in facts and reason, and I won’t let an unexplained anomaly tarnish my scientific standing.

### PoI-124 INFORMATION FILE.

PoI-124.
  
**Real name:** Jean Barsan.
**Date of birth:** May 1840.
**Sex:** Male.
**Background:** Subject Jean Barsan is identified as a French architectural anartist and a verified affiliate of the organization "Are WE Cool Yet?" (AWCY?). Records indicate that the subject formally became associated with the entity in 1876, subsequent to his acceptance into the "Association Des Architectes Cools Francais"[6](javascript:;) (AACF), an organization purportedly established as an autonomous subdivision of AWCY?. The AACF functioned as a collective of anartists specializing in the design and construction of anomalous architectural structures. The AACF was officially disbanded in 1941.
During a comprehensive examination of anomalous objects recovered within French jurisdiction, it was confirmed that Subject PoI-124 was implicated in the development of multiple sites and edifices exhibiting non-Euclidean spatial properties, both prior to and following his membership in the AACF. The most recent documented instance concerns a residential property located in Marseille, wherein passage through any interior door results in the individual being unpredictably relocated to alternate rooms in ███████.
In 1879, Subject PoI-124 was formally expelled from the AACF. The rationale for expulsion remains absent from available documentation; however, testimonial evidence from remaining AACF members characterizes the subject’s methodologies and ideological framework as exceeding the acceptable parameters established by the organization. Subsequent to expulsion, no anomalous activity attributable to PoI-124 was recorded until his involvement in the design and development of SCP-6517 was subsequently identified.
**State:** Current location is unknown.

**Subject:** Incident-6517-Echo.234-11.
**Date:** ██/██/2007
**Location:** Tianducheng, China.
* * *
**Incident Report:** In 2007, an instance designated SCP-6517-B-11 manifested in Tianducheng, China. Agents affiliated with the Global Occult Coalition (GOC) operating in the region successfully identified the anomalous characteristics of the entity at the time of emergence.
Prior to the deployment of Foundation field personnel tasked with implementing containment and standard handling protocols, the GOC coordinated with the government of the People’s Republic of China. In collaboration with Chinese authorities, a full evacuation was executed for all civilians residing within Tianducheng and a six-kilometer radius surrounding SCP-6517-B-11.
At ██:██ PM, a surface-to-surface missile was launched from a GOC base located in ████████, approximately ██ kilometers from the site, targeting SCP-6517-B-11 with the intent to neutralize the entity.
According to data provided by the GOC, the missile strike resulted in the destruction of a significant portion of SCP-6517-B-11. This was immediately followed by a violent counter-reaction from the entity. The GOC report details that SCP-6517-B-11 exhibited a retraction of [REDACTED] seismic activity, followed by the emission of an energy wave of unknown origin.

SCP-6517-B-11 **[REDACTED]** , during Incident-6517-Echo-11. Photographer unknown
The energy discharge caused confirmed fatalities totaling ██ GOC personnel and ██ members of the Chinese military involved in the operation. Subsequently, SCP-6517-B-11 initiated regenerative processes, restoring itself from inflicted damage.
Approximately ten minutes post-impact, SCP-6517-B-11 emitted a second energy wave. While the immediate effects were not initially observed, later analysis confirmed an anomalous cognitive phenomenon affecting an undefined radius surrounding the entity. Affected individuals exhibited an unexplained loss of native language proficiency, adopting French as their primary language.
Upon full regeneration of SCP-6517-B-11, adjacent structures within Tianducheng underwent extensive physical and architectural modifications. Over a period of forty minutes, these changes culminated in the transformation of all proximate buildings into traditional French-style architecture, closely resembling a replica of Paris.
Additionally, a residential apartment within the affected zone has been designated Point of Interest PoI-124-A2. Comparative analysis of this location’s design and positioning against architectural plans and property records from Paris confirms correspondence with the former residence of Subject PoI-124.
The apartment is furnished in a 20th-century style and contains multiple documents and journals attributed to PoI-124. Among these is document-6517-21-035, which is referenced in addendum-6517-04 for further review.

**Closing Note:** Following the incident, the SCP Foundation formally liaised with the government of the People’s Republic of China to assume responsibility for the containment and management of SCP-6517-B-11, succeeding the Global Occult Coalition (GOC) in operational control.
Standard containment protocols were promptly implemented in accordance with Foundation regulations.
Subsequently, a coordinated campaign was conducted by Foundation field agents to administer Class-B amnestic treatment to all individuals identified as witnesses to the incident, including both civilian personnel and members of the Chinese military.

**Document-6517-21-035:** The following document was recovered from PoI-124-A2, on ██/██/2007.
#### Project Proposal 1889-228: "La dame de fer"
**Name:** Jean Barsan
**Title:** La dame de fer
**Material Requirements:**
  * 70kg of cement (Already used in the sphere).
  * The French flag (Already used in the sphere).
  * The thunder of Zeus (Already used in the sphere).
  * The spirit of the French Revolution ( I'll save this for the last step).
  * A monument that will represent the French Republic (This will be the Eiffel Tower)

**Abstract:** The first step is to wait for the tower's construction to be completed.
The sphere will be placed at the highest point on the tower, where the sun meets the horizon, aligning perfectly with the sphere.
Next, the sphere must be powered, and for that, I will summon the spirit of the French Revolution. To do this, I will need to use mine as a host for the spirit. If everything goes according to plan, the sphere will merge with the tower’s structure, allowing it to expand.
The final step will be to extend the tower's foundations underground and then to any location on the planet. If the spirit can remember its original form, I will be able to reconstruct the tower with varying precision, but it should serve its purpose.
**Intent:** As for myself, I like to think that I've been a patriot since I was a child. When I was young, I always enjoyed reading about the Napoleonic wars, a time when our nation was at the height of its power and glory. The only cowardly way we were defeated was by others avoiding direct combat with us in the first place. And although we are still considered one of the great powers today, I feel that our downfall isn’t far off. It’s the cycle of life for every empire that has reached its golden age—to eventually fall back into darkness.
In addition to history, art was one of the hobbies that held a special place in my heart. I wanted to become an artist, but of course, my father had a different idea. He wanted me to specialize in mathematics and accounting. Naturally, I didn’t want to give up my passion for art, but I wasn’t in a position to stand up to my father. However, I managed to reach a compromise with him and decided to specialize in architectural design. Architecture wasn’t what I initially envisioned as an artistic field, but I’ll admit that I grew to love it over time.
In the years that followed, nothing particularly remarkable happened in my life. I went to college, met Émile there, graduated, and started working for various architecture firms. But the turning point came when I discovered a new field of art—a field that would give my architectural creations a new dimension, a spirit of their own, allowing them to speak for themselves. Unfortunately, there weren’t many people interested in this field, and some exhibitions in France even banned it. However, I eventually managed to find and join a community here in Paris that shared my liberating artistic vision—or so I thought, until I realized they were just a group of arrogant, envious individuals lacking any sense of adventure into the unknown, and my last adventure with them was during the exhibition held in Velmont, and among everything showcased there, my piece was so magnificent that it made the city jump. Because of this, they came up with some feeble excuses to expel me from the community. But I see it as liberation from their boxed-in ideas. I regret nothing.
Simply put, my works have always depicted the golden age of the Republic, representing how our values and ideas influenced the world in both the past and the future. The Eiffel Tower will be the true portrayal of France: an elegant and cultured lady, yet also strong and stubborn like iron, extending her values like roots to all the civilized nations of the world and establishing them.
I have grown old now and considered retiring for a while, but not before making a grand exit, which is why I trust no one but myself to undertake this task.

[\- Addendum-6517-05: Note from Dr. Harrison](javascript:;)
After what happened with the GOC, I have become certain that neutralizing SCP-6517 using physical force is crossed out of our options.
My analysis of the incident in China leads me to believe that the tower might be sentient, which could indicate the presence of some spirit inhabiting it. Therefore, my alternative proposal is to apply traditional exorcism to the tower, which might completely neutralize its anomalous properties. [Its either that, or we're gonna have to remove the entire country of France from the existence.](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7779) But, witnessing the results of the last neutralization attempt, makes me question whether it is truly worth the risk.
