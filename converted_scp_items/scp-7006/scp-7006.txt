DISRUPTION

CLASS:

 AMIDA

An icosahedral die (d20), frequently used as part of Ritual-7006.

SPECIAL CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES:

 SCP-7006 is maintained via annual performance of the 

Ritual of Absolution

 (Ritual-7006). Ritual-7006 must be performed exactly once each year, as further detailed in this document.

If Ritual-7006 is performed unsuccessfully, the Foundation must act according to Level Gamma emergency procedures until the next year arrives.

Due to its deep connection to the Foundation

.

 

Radix:

 Item has been integrated into the Foundation's command structure.

 , information regarding SCP-7006 and Ritual-7006 must be kept secret. Groups of Interest external to the Foundation learning of SCP-7006 is considered a failure of the Veil Protocol.

In the event that Ritual-7006 loses its potence, Foundation thaumatologists are to be employed in order to engineer a new, successful variant of it as soon as is possible.

The date presently dedicated to the completion of Ritual-7006 is August 1st.

DESCRIPTION:

 SCP-7006 is a powerful thaumaturgical bond which closely links the SCP Foundation to three conceptual entities existing outside of normative reality, maintained and strengthened by the 

Ritual of Absolution

.

These three entities — classically referred to as the 

Triad of Absolutes

 (or: the 

Triad

; the 

Absolutes

) — collectively exert a formidable, generalized influence on the day-to-day affairs and activities of the Foundation at large; this extends to the following areas:

Containment efforts

Ritualistic practices

Thaumaturgical practices

Parascientific innovation

Strategic practices

Bureaucratic processes

Internal and external security

Defensive practices

 

 

 

 

 

 and more.

The influence exerted on the above areas of Foundation activity is, of great note, wholly positive — while a sufficient relationship between the Foundation and the 

Triad

 is maintained through Ritual-7006, the Foundation's efforts will, seemingly by chance, yield fruitful results.

Though both SCP-7006's and the 

Triad's

 full history with the Foundation is not known, it is understood that this bond is one that has acted as a longstanding boon for almost the totality of our organization's existence. While SCP-7006 is maintained, the Foundation flourishes. It is presumed that the bond's presence is responsible for propelling the Foundation to the grandiose logistical successes it knows today.

If Ritual-7006 is not performed during a given year, or fails, SCP-7006's positive effects will begin to diminish; this progresses on an annual basis for an unknown duration, presumably ending with the bond's total severance. According to record, this has never occurred.

It is not known what such an event entails.

RITUAL-7006:

 Ritual-7006 (

Ritual of Absolution

, 

Ceremony of Absolution

, 

The Providence

) is an ornate thaumaturgical procession which alters probability (also known as 'luck', 'chance', 'fate' or ‘destiny’) to favor the Foundation's mission of Securement, Containment, and Protection. This is accomplished through a series of rites which involve several 'lucky' or 'unlucky' items, events, sigils, signifiers, and superstitions. Among these are as follows:

Ritual-7006, as expressed via recursive iconographic notation.

The conduction of a lottery among select Foundation staff; the winner is awarded a cash prize, and the winning ticket is torn into sevenths.

The burning of forty four-leafed clovers atop a ritual pyre, which uses 1/7th of the aforementioned lottery ticket as fuel.

Flipping a gold coin until it comes up heads ten times in a row, and then biting down on the coin so that it bends in half.

The temporary retirement of a member of the O5 Council, so that the Council numbers twelve instead of thirteen.

Conducting no work on Friday the 13th.

Rolling dice fashioned from magical materials such as human bone and meteorites, and the destruction of such dice that roll below their median more than 50% of the allotted time.

Performance of Ritual-7006-Warden.

WARDEN:

 Ritual-7006-Warden is a unique rite in which the conditions of each 

Absolute

 are allegorically appeased inside of a constructed fictional environment. The performance of Ritual-7006-Warden is by far the most difficult and variable part of Ritual-7006, as for it to be effective there must be a non-negligible possibility of failure.

Ritual-7006-Warden makes use of a role-playing framework recovered by the Foundation from an anomalous "wargames" society operating in England during the late 19th century. Lightly changed by Foundation thaumatologists to suit the needs of Ritual-7006, this framework has proven immensely effective at fulfilling the symbological and ritualistic needs of the 

Triad

 in an environment with an efficiently low level of immediate physical consequences.

Through 7006-Warden, ritualists play the roles of Avatars, together forming a fantastical "party" collectively representing the Foundation, embarking on three missions representing the qualities of each 

Absolute

. Succeeding in these missions (henceforth called "modules") contributes to Ritual-7006's efficiency; if one or more are failed, this likely causes Ritual-7006 as a whole to fail, or to be massively weakened.

Performances of Ritual-7006-Warden take place atop a Foundation sigil.

 

RULESET:

 A condensed form of Ritual-7006-Warden's rules have been provided below; for a full version, personnel may consult 

this document

.

 

7006-Warden

OFFICIAL HANDBOOK

 

ABILITIES:

STR:

 Physicality, brawn & toughness.

DEX:

 Speed, sneaking & precision.

CTRL:

 Willpower, charm & the weird.

SAVES:

Roll d20 equal to or under target 

Ability

. The party at most risk in a contested action makes the save.

HIT PROTECTION:

HP

 reflects an Avatar's ability to avoid damage (both from Damage and Stress).

HEALING:

A quick rest fully restores HP but can leave the Avatars exposed. 

Ability

 loss requires a week's rest with medical intervention or magical means.

DEPRIVATION:

Deprived

 keeps an Avatar from recovering HP. Being deprived for more than 24hrs adds Fatigue to an Avatar's inventory. 

Fatigue

 takes up one slot and lasts until they can recuperate. This can happen multiple times.

INVENTORY:

Avatars each have 10 inventory slots. Most items take up one slot. 

Bulky

 items take up two slots and are awkward or difficult to carry. All 10 slots being in use lowers HP to 0.

MAGIC:

A new spell is created each morning. It is random or is a copy of one from the previous day. Spells take up one item slot. Spells cost one action to cast. One may attempt a CTRL save to retain the spell. If deprived or in danger, a CTRL save may be required to avoid dire consequences. See 

this table

 for more details.

ACTIONS:

On their turn, Avatars may move up to 40ft and take a single action. Actions may take the form of casting a spell, attacking, additional movement, or some other reasonable activity. These take place simultaneously.

Retreating

 from a doomed situation requires a successful DEX save and a safe destination.

For the 

Start of Combat

 round, Avatars must pass an DEX save in order to act.

Subsequent turns have players acting, then adversaries.

COMBAT:

All attacks automatically hit. Attackers roll their 

Stress

 or 

Damage

 die, subtract any protections from 

Armor

 (Damage) or 

Stability

 (Stress), and deal the remaining total to the opponent's HP. Excess Damage is dealt to STR and excess Stress is dealt to CTRL.

If there are 

Multiple attackers

, or one using two weapons, roll all damage dice together and keep the single highest die.

Unarmed

 attacks always do 1d4 Damage. 

Impaired

 attacks (position of weakness) reduce Damage die to 1d4. Shooting into cover is Impaired. 

Enhanced

 attacks (position of advantage) increase Damage die to 1d12. 

Blast

 affects all area targets, rolling separately for each.

DAMAGE:

Damage that exceeds the remaining HP applies the excess to STR. They must then make a STR save to avoid 

Critical Damage

. Failure drops them out of combat, dying if left untreated.

Having STR 0 means 

death

; having DEX 0 is paralysis; having CTRL 0 means they are lost.

STRESS AND FALLOUT:

Ritualist chooses from the 

Stress Fallout

 table when either:

Stress reduces an Avatar's HP to exactly 0.

An Avatar takes Critical Stress (when they fail a CTRL save after it takes Ability damage)

Each Stress Fallout entry:

Can only be chosen once at the table (unless denoted).

Consumes an inventory slot.

 

 

Illustration of the six Avatars prepared for this year's 7006-Warden performance.

AVATARS:

 Ritual-7006-Warden is intended to be performed with two to six pre-constructed Avatars (player characters, party members) created using the game system, collectively representing aspects of the Foundation. These Avatars are refreshed annually in order to adapt to the changing circumstances befalling the previous year. In-game documentation relating to the Avatars currently in circulation may be found below.

You don’t get to know about Charlie Smith’s past. Hell, you probably don't even know their real name. And they’re determined to keep it that way. They’re loyal to the Foundation, and to themselves. They’re determined to keep all details about their past as secret as possible. Judging from the lighter they carry around, they might be a smoker.

Beyond that? They’re an enigma.

What do you get when you throw six serial killers, three of the most bloodthirsty warlords in history, and a demigod into a blender? The answer is likely ‘a mess’, and that’s not the worst description for Bellona-7.

She was grown in secret by Project Bellona, a blackbox so tight the Ethics Committee didn’t know about it until she slaughtered fifty people. She’s a chimerical homunculus, whose essence is composed of some of the worst serial killers the Foundation has ever dealt with, three ruthless generals, and the Daevite demigod 

Ab-Leshal

. She was grown to be in peak physical condition at twenty-five years of age, but nobody counted on her being intelligent.

The Foundation required a brute who responded to chemical signals and electrical stimulus. They were gifted with a predator who learned to read at three days old, learned to escape her cell at four days old, and killed her ‘father’, the head of Project Bellona, before the month was out. Since then, she’s been used by the Foundation to eliminate… ‘priority targets’. By all accounts, she’s a pleasant person to talk to, but she is brutal, and absolutely ruthless in combat.

Magic | Revolting Sphere:

 Conjures a ball, or large lump, of something utterly disgusting. Entities must roll a CTRL save or take d8 Stress.

Orville was born with a silver spoon in his mouth, and has spent every day disgusted at the taste. His father was a museum curator, and he was always told to follow in his footsteps and keep the family tradition alive. However, in the process of growing his collection, he ran afoul of a certain organization.

An artifact brought to him from the far east was found to be trafficked by an insurgent organization working against the Foundation. The artifact, a small piece of jade shaped like a pill, let off an aura that beckoned whoever was near it to consume it. Orville kept it locked under glass, which seemed to abate the effect. However, the artifact’s properties were known to the Foundation, who soon came knocking.

Orville was reluctant to part with it, but part with it he did — or he attempted to, at any rate. Instead, he found himself absently stuffing the pill down his throat while explaining its anomalous properties. From that day, a single command overrode his psyche: Collect. He did not know what to Collect, or why. But when the Foundation saw this change, they offered him either surgery and amnesticization, or a position.

He took the position.

 (d6)

Magic | Hastening Crystal:

 Conjures a tetrahedral prism that bathes her allies in light. Those caught in this light act before all enemies, and roll two dice for DEX saves, taking the more favorable result.

Magic | Crushing Spray:

 A ‘spray’ of light that increases gravity in an area, dealing a d8 Blast to all caught in its wake, and pinning enemies to the ground for a turn.

Magic | Reflecting Echo:

 Turns enemy attacks into sonic force for a turn, reflecting any Damage that would be dealt to her allies back to them.

Magic | Enlightening Smoke:

 Enshrouds the area in a smoke that hinders sight, but makes enemy weakpoints highly visible. Damage rolled against these weakpoints is Enhanced (d12 Damage) and 1s and 2s are rerolled.

Jewelry

 (Carved from her own bones. +1 Stability.)

Imani was never a healthy child. From a young age, she was plagued with all sorts of afflictions, and no matter how much medicine her mother gave her, none of it seemed to work. This was because Imani’s affliction was spiritual — she was being haunted by a creature that none could see.

That was until a fateful day, when she was still a teenager. Imani suffered a horrible acute headache: a swelling. The best course of action the doctors could think of was to cut open her skull to relieve the pressure. When she awoke, she could see the thing haunting her in all its detail. It was not long before she set about trying to kill it.

When she read that charms of bone can repel evil, she carved a charm using a piece of her own skull (since replaced by metal plates) and managed to destroy her tormentor. In doing so, her health vastly improved — so vastly, in fact, that the Foundation came calling soon after.

Today she is known for her immense dedication to the parascientific method, a master of both normative and anormative fields.

Bayan Novak wanted to be a storyteller for as long as he could remember. Not necessarily a writer, but someone who catalogs stories and chronicles of all eras, and helps proliferate them back into the world. He collected first editions of novels, went on digs in ancient archaeological sites, and worked tirelessly to make sure that the best and oldest stories stayed in circulation.

Bayan’s story involves a book full of names, one he’s had since childhood. It was given to him by a woman with vibrant green eyes — an old guardian — who gave him his mission to be a storyteller. His name is inside the book, but it is transient, travelling from page to page, cover to cover. There are seven-hundred and seventy-six other names in the book, storytellers all; he often finds the names crossed out, and the storytellers dead, vanished, or somehow corrupted.

He discovered the Foundation after investigating a name linked to them, and was abruptly exposed to the wider world of the anomalous. Bayan accepted the supernatural with open arms, for he knows that the only way to unravel the secret of his book is to find the woman who gave it to him, and to do that, he must become familiar with this new world.

Eztli chose their name, because they had been robbed of everything else.

Growing up, they learned hard, cruel lessons about pain and misery, and vowed that they would save others from such experiences when they were able. To that end, they became a medic, working on the battlefield to save lives and alleviate suffering.

Etzli has, until now, killed two people: the first, they shot in defense of a patient. The second, they let die on an operating table after they heard the patient laughing, gloating about how they had the ability to make their war last for an eternity, and consume the continent. The patient demonstrated this by causing two other patients in the same tent — who had been recovering — to keel over in a pool of their own blood.

This thing, not a human, was being targeted by the Foundation for containment, and when they learned Etzli was responsible for its death, the Foundation delivered an ultimatum: join us, or never work as a medic again.

PREPARING MODULES …

 

The Parable of the Warden

What games do gods play?

Is the thunder the clatter of their dice in a cup?

Is the wind the motion of their arms as they draw a card?

Are earthquakes the shifting of their board?

Do we live and die by their whims?

Their whims, we thought, were out of our control.

But then, deep in the archives, we found it:

Their rulebook.

Those who read it know of the horror that lurks in spaces too liminal.

What games do gods play?

They play with our lives.

What if the thunder is just sound following light?

What if the wind is just cold following heat?

What if earthquakes are just the earth, in a fit of rage?

Doubt is common, down in the Foundations of reality.

That is why we seek Absolution.

 

MODULES LOADED.

GOOD LUCK.

 

NOTE:

 It is heavily advised that ritualists operate Ritual-7006-Warden on a capable desktop device. Handheld devices are not recommended.
