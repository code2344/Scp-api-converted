MTF INVOLVED:

 Mobile Task Force Iota-2 (”Longest Legs”)

FOREWORD:

 Intel of an auction organized by GoI-014 (”Marshall, Carter & Dark”) had been provided by embedded agents of MTF Mu-3 ("Highest Bidders"). MTF Iota-2 was subsequently sent to infiltrate and seize as many anomalous objects it could covertly obtain.

[BEGIN LOG]

 

<View is that of a large room, decorated in the Victorian-era style of architecture.>

<Rows of seats line the center of the room, dining tables with exotic foodstuffs on the sidelines and a large stage with purple velvet curtains on the front.>

<There are men and women dressed in suits and other fine attire on the seats, some located near the dining tables. Agent Bokowitz Pearce and the rest of MTF Iota-2 are seated in the second and third row up the front, respectively.>

<Agent Pearce has just turned his concealed recorder on.>

 

PEARCE:

 Go with the show.

IOTA-2 | GECKO:

 Got it.

IOTA-2 | POST:

 Aye, aye.

IOTA-2 | CHARLIE:

 You got it, boss.

 

<On the stage stands a man dressed in a red suit and a woman dressed in blue showgirl attire. The woman is holding a standard desk lamp in her hand and is smashing it against a table repeatedly. Despite this, the lamp remains unharmed.>

<The man gestures for the woman to stop. She complies. Both smile widely at the crowd.>

 

AUCTIONEER:

 … And that is the unbreakable lamp! Interested?

 

<A person in the front row raises their hand.>

 

PERSON 1:

 $200,000.

AUCTIONEER:

 $200,000! Who else? Anyone got more to offer?

PERSON 2:

 250,000.

AUCTIONEER:

 Rise by 50,000! Come on, people! You'll never find anything like it ever again!

 

<Agent Pearce raises his hand.>

 

PEARCE:

 $280,000.

AUCTIONEER:

 280 grand!

 

<Another man raises their hand.>

 

PERSON 3:

 290,000.

AUCTIONEER:

 Increase to 290 grand!

PEARCE:

 295,000.

AUCTIONEER:

 It keeps on rising! Last chance!

PERSON 3:

 350,000.

AUCTIONEER:

 Jesus!

 

<Agent Pearce is in deep thought. Agent Sam Lillon, sitting next to him, looks at him nervouly.>

 

AUCTIONEER:

 350 grand! Final offer!

 

<The woman holds the lamp around theatrically.>

 

PEARCE:

 $450,000

 

<The crowd gasps in shock. Agent Lillon jabs Pearce in the side.>

 

LILLON:

 

(quiet)

 Are you nuts?

PEARCE:

 I really want that lamp.

AUCTIONEER:

 450 grand! That's the final offer! Anyone got something better, do it now!

 

<The crowd remains silent.>

 

AUCTIONEER:

 Then that's it! The unbreakable lamp goes to Mr. Bokowitz Pearce!

 

<The crowd claps. The woman walks behind the stage with the lamp.>

 

LILLON:

 That could've backfired so hard.

PEARCE:

 Respect your elders.

 

<The woman reenters the stage. In her hands in a small statuette of an arachnoid entity.>

<There is an immediate change to the crowd. Many begin to look around, behind them, under their seats. Some become motionless, while others begin to scratch themselves and rub their ears.>

 

PEARCE:

 That looks promising…

AUCTIONEER:

 Ladies and gentlemen! We'd like to present to you an artefact that's been under our care for centuries now… Once having belonged to the noble Sir Percival Darke, it was passed to his only daughter, Iris Dark. She has made the ultimate decision to finally offer it for auction.

 

<The woman holds the statuette up. The crowd looks at it in awe. Pearce leans in.>

 

AUCTIONEER:

 Now, if the demonstration's been enough, we can proceed to—

PERSON 4:

 500,000.

PERSON 5:

 600,000.

PERSON 6:

 670,000.

AUCTIONEER:

 We starting in the sky with this one!

PEARCE:

 890,000.

AUCTIONEER:

 Anyone up to it?

 

<The crowd is silent.>

 

AUCTIONEER:

 

(chuckles)

 Well, well! Looks like this artefact now belongs to Mr. Bo—

 

<A shot rings out from behind Iota-2. A man in the farther rows is standing, holding a gun in his hands.>

<More shots ring out, which hit and kill the man and woman on the stage. They scream in agony.>

<The entire crowd descends into panic. People stand up and attempt to rush out of the room, tripping and trampling over each other.>

<Agent Pearce and the rest of Iota-2 draw their weapons. They aim at the assailant.>

<The assailant dodges the shots of Iota-2. They are rapidly making their way toward the stage. Agent Pearce realizes this and begins to head toward the stage as well.>

<The assailant grabs the artefact. Just as they have it in their hands, Pearce shoots them in the leg. They writhe on the floor in pain. Iota-2 quickly surrounds the subject.>

 

PEARCE:

 Who are you?

 

<The assailant remains silent, staring intently at Agent Pearce.>

 

PEARCE:

 Not the talkative type, huh?

ASSAILANT:

 

(silent) Unglott… (indecipherable)

PEARCE:

 What?

 

<A low snapping noise is heard. Shortly after the assailant begins to froth at the mouth. They soon expire.>

<Pearce averts his gaze.>

 

PEARCE:

 Jesus Christ…

 

<Pearce rubs his eyes. Only after a few seconds is he able to look at the assailant again.>

 

LILLON:

 Sir, we should go.

 

<Pearce nods.>

 

PEARCE:

 Yes… 

(pauses)

 gather everything you can find as quickly as possible.

LAB RECORDING

DATE:

 03/21/2025

LOCATION:

 Foundation Research Site-67

FOREWORD:

 To gather more information on it, the artefact was sent to Site-67's head of archeology and arachnology.

[BEGIN LOG]

 

<It is a stark white lab. Various recording equipment and vials are strewn over all surfaces.>

<In a far corner of the lab sits a woman, slumped over in a swivel chair, equipment lying there seemingly at random and an open book on mating cycles of spiders in her hands. This woman is Dr. Tara Nilay Tula. She is asleep.>

<Agents Pearce and Lillon enter the lab. Pearce knocks against the metal door. Lillon is holding a small storage container.>

 

PEARCE:

 Special delivery.

 

<Dr. Tula rouses from her sleep slightly.>

 

TULA:

 

(mutters)

 Yeah, yeah… I'll clean this up in an hour…

PEARCE:

 

(clears throat)

 I've got something for you.

TULA:

 

(yawns loudly)

 What is i—

 

<Lillon sets the storage container on the table. He inserts a key and opens the box. Inside it lies SCP-8535.>

<Dr. Tula immediately rises from her sleep.>

 

TULA:

 What is that?

PEARCE:

 An artefact we ripped off some MCD peeps. It causes you to hear weird things. The higher-yuppies wanted you to take a closer look at it.

 

<Dr. Tula takes SCP-8535 out of the box. Its gem stones reflect brightly in the dim light of her corner. She seems mesmerized by it.>

<There is an abrupt change in her stance, as she begins to look all around her. Agent Pearce places his hand on her shoulder.>

 

PEARCE:

 Told you.

TULA:

 These noises… they're the hissing of tarantulas.

PEARCE:

 Not from any snake species?

TULA:

 Nice assumption. But no.

 

<Pearce sighs. He retrieves a $5 bill from his pocket and hands it over to Lillon, who is smiling broadly.>

 

TULA:

 I mean it literally looks like a spider.

PEARCE:

 Continue.

TULA:

 Well, there needs to be more testing done. What is it made of, how old is it, yatta, yatta. You get the gist.

PEARCE:

 You don't seem that impressed.

TULA:

 This certainly is no turtle shell. What do they call it now? 

107

-something?

PEARCE:

 How long do you think it'll take you?

TULA:

 Maybe two hours. I gotta work on my sleep schedule…

PEARCE:

 Well, because…

 

<Pearce approaches Tula so that their faces are nearly touching. He holds her hand in his.>

 

PEARCE:

 You can take a visit to my dorm after this.

LILLON:

 I'm just gonna…

 

<Agent Lillon heads out the door.>

<Dr. Tula leans into Pearce's ear.>

 

TULA:

 Not when I'm at work, honey.

 

<Agent Pearce looks defeated.>

 

PEARCE:

 Fair enough.

 

<He heads toward the exit. After much thinking, Dr. Tula walks up to Pearce again. He turns around.>

 

TULA:

 Although I 

can

 give you this…

 

<Dr. Tula jumps up and places a kiss right on Agent Pearce's forehead.>

<He stares at her. He chuckles.>

 

PEARCE:

 You're a bum, you know that?

TULA:

 Since the day you've asked me out on that boat.

 

<Pearce turns around to leave. Dr. Tula lightly slaps Agent Pearce on the buttocks.>

 

TULA:

 Warm that bed up for me!

PEARCE:

 Oh, trust me, I will.

TULA:

 Love you and I always will, Bo!

PEARCE:

 Love 

you

 and I always will!

 

<Agent Pearce exits the laboratory.>

<Tables are strewn about. A line of D-Class personnel have congregated at the front, trays in hand. The cafeteria is filled to the brim, with barely any seats left.>

<Agents Pearce and Lillon stand in the corner, armed with non-lethal weaponry.>

<Pearce scouts out the area.>

 

LILLON:

 This place seems livelier than usual.

 

<Pearce tips Lillon in the arm and points toward a D-Class, D-9634. They are holding no tray and are rapidly walking toward another D-Class.>

 

PEARCE:

 Trouble.

 

<D-9634 stops near D-11424, who is eating his lunch. They place their hand on his shoulder. D-11424 tenses up and stops eating. He takes a deep breath and closes his eyes.>

 

D-9634:

 You went into that 

cabinet maze

 the other day, didn't you?

D-11424:

 Why?

D-9634:

 The other guy that went with you.

D-11424:

 What about hi—

 

<D-9634 places a punch right into D-11424's face. They knock him to the floor and proceed to assault them.>

 

D-9634:

 He was my brother! Why did you let him die?!

 

<Pearce and Lillon rush to the scene. They push their way through a crowd of onlookers.>

 

LILLON:

 Stop! Let him go!

 

<Lillon yanks D-9634 back to look at him. D-9634 retaliates the gesture by punching Agent Lillon across the face. The crowd gasps. Some cheer.>

<Pearce pushes D-9634 to the floor and starts assaulting them. He hits their face again and again.>

<Only after D-9634 raises his arms in defense in pure terror does Agent Pearce stop. He gets off from D-9634. He helps up Agent Lillon.>

 

PEARCE:

 You good?

 

<Lillon is clutching a bloody nose.>

 

LILLON:

 You should see the other guy…

 

<The crowd disperses. D-11424 stares at the agents, before abruptly hurrying away.>

 

PEARCE:

 Looks good, L. You know, women dig this sort of stuff.

LILLON:

 Scars?

PEARCE:

 Courage.

 

<A clapping noise sounds from a hallway. Approaching them is 

Site-Director Bobby Dellen

. The two agents immediately stand at attention.>

 

DELLEN:

 

(chuckles)

 Please! Gentlemen. Seems like you've caused quite a ruckus.

 

<D-9634 writhes on the floor.>

 

LILLON:

 Director, what is wrong?

PEARCE:

 What's the occasion?

DELLEN:

 What the occasion is? Well, besides our feud with Marshall, Carter & Dark, nothing much.

PEARCE:

 Is that sarcasm?

LILLON:

 Why the sarcasm?

DELLEN:

 We've identified the assailant at the auction. A man under the name Zeven Burns, a resident of Three Portlands. I had hoped you could…

PEARCE:

 Rummage through his personal belongings.

DELLEN:

 Amongst other things, yes.

PEARCE:

 Why would we do that?

DELLEN:

 We humans are curious creatures! If there's a question, we need an answer. Especially if said answers pertain to some spider artefact. We wanna know why it's so important and if we can expect raids at Site-67 in the near future. You in?

PEARCE:

 We've got a choice?

DELLEN:

 No. But it's always nice to ask.

PEARCE:

 Okay. We're in.

DELLEN:

 Excellent! The mission will be conducted tomorrow morning. I wish you gentlemen the best of luck!

 

<With that, Director Dellen exits the area.>

 

PEARCE:

 Looks like we're going on a road trip.

LILLON:

 I've got a question…

PEARCE:

 Shoot.

LILLON:

 What is a Portland?

MISSION LOG

DATE:

 03/24/2025

LOCATION:

 Location of Interest Three Portlands

MTF INVOLVED:

 Mobile Task Force Iota-2 ("Longest Legs")

FOREWORD:

 To gain more insight into artefact SCP-8535, MTF Iota-2 was sent to LoI Three Portlands, the last known residence of PoI-8535.

[BEGIN LOG]

 

<The six members of MTF Iota-2 are located in front of a Way

2

 in an alleyway in Portland, Oregon, USA. The members are dressed in plain clothes, carrying concealed firearms. There is an engraving of a door in red chalk on a wall.>

 

PEARCE:

 

(claps hands together)

 Okay, so. The Portlands are an extraordinary place. Extraordinary topology, extraordinary weather, with extraordinary people in it. The citizens don't appreciate the presence of people like us, so we gotta stay low. There are a hundred humans that travel into the Portlands every day, so we shouldn't have too much problems fitting in. I think…

IOTA-2 | GECKO:

 So we go through, search the place, get out?

IOTA-2 | CHARLIE:

 Seems like a very simple mission.

PEARCE:

 

(points)

 Guy knows his stuff.

 

<Pearce walks up to the chalk drawing of the door. He knocks against it three times, then backs off.>

<The outline of the drawing begins to dimly glow red. There is a slow rumble in the ground. The wall moves outward to reveal a bright white space behind it. Agent Pearce gestures toward the entrance.>

 

PEARCE:

 Let's go.

 

<Iota-2 enters through the Way.>

<Contact with Iota-2 is temporarily lost. Once contact is reestablished, Iota-2 is within the confines of Three Portlands.>

<Large buildings that look as though they were stacked on top of each other line either side of the street. The streets are bustling with human and non-human/non-humanoid entities, a market set out in front of them. A public trolley system bustles by them overhead, ringing a melodic bell.>

<The ground they walk on is plagued with ripples and cracks. Some plant life is sprouting out through these ripples and cracks.>

<Iota-2 is in the poorer districts of the city, with a high unemployment, homelessness and crime rate. In the distance, kilometers away, there is the tall, sleek, clean headquarters building of Anderson Robotics.>

<Agent Lillon looks around curiously.>

 

PEARCE:

 The target's house is a few rows down. On the outskirts. 

The Periphery.

 

<Agent Lillon is clearly unfocused. Pearce jabs him in the arm. He snaps to attention.>

 

PEARCE:

 You there, buddy?

LILLON:

 I'm sorry, sir.

PEARCE:

 Don't feel too bad. First time I got sent here my mouth was all the way to the ground, too. And we're not even in the most beautiful parts. You gotta see the Portlands' more populated areas. In the night, the abundance of Ways at the top of the Anderson Robotics tower is truly a sight. But it isn't an excuse to slip up now. The Periphery's a dangerous place.

LILLON:

 And what exactly is the Periphery?

PEARCE:

 The ground of the Portlands is constantly moving outwards, all the way to the edge of un-reality. Once it reaches the edge, it just sort of… dissolves. That's the Periphery.

LILLON:

 And we're headed there?

PEARCE:

 Yes.

 

<Iota-2 reaches their location. The ground is visibly shifting outward toward the edge. As surrounding structures tip over the edge they float in the air and dematerialize. Some parts of the structures break off and remain floating for a bit over the abyss.>

<Iota-2 enters the run-down apartment building. The stairwell inside is equally as dilapitated as the outside, with graffiti adorning the walls and flights. It is apparent that no one has lived in here for quite a while.>

<They arrive at the apartment of PoI-8535. They enter.>

<The interior is dark and the windows are boarded-up. The paint is peeling off the walls. There is mold eating through the wooden flooring. Agent Pearce gestures for Iota-2 to search the area.>

<Pearce ventures into the bedroom. There is only a mattress in the middle of the room. Pearce searches through a bedside table. There is nothing of value inside. He returns back to the living room area.>

 

LILLON:

 Found anything yet, Pearce?

PEARCE:

 If you could call a few specks of dust a find…

 

<There is a rumbling coming from one of the closets in the kitchen. Pearce and Lillon stare at each other. They approach the location, accompanied by the rest of Iota-2.>

<As they are surrounding the closet, Agent Pearce grabs a hold of his firearm. The other members raise their firearms as well.>

<Pearce approaches the closet as carefully and as quietly as possible. He reaches his hand out toward the handle.>

<The flooboards creak as he steps on them.>

<At that point a figure bursts out of the closet. The figure is hooded and is wearing a wooden mask with intricate, unidentifiable runes engraved on it. The Iota-2 members take fire, but the figure evades all shots. They kick several agents to the floor, including Agent Pearce, before sprinting and bursting through a glass window to the outside.>

<Agent Lillon helps Pearce back up.>

 

LILLON:

 You okay—

PEARCE:

 Move!

 

<Pearce, Lillon and the rest of Iota-2 chase after the figure.>

<The figure is jumping along the rooftops of several houses. Iota-2 is right behind them.>

<Some agents take shots. They miss the figure by a foot.>

 

PEARCE:

 Be careful! We're nearly—

 

<The figure jumps off the last rooftop in the line, right into the Periphery. Agent Pearce and Iota-2 stop at the edge, gazing into the infinite abyss.>

<The figure holds onto a slab of concrete that is floating upwards. The agents take fire, but the bullets dissolve.>

<The figure quickly moves upward. They stare at Iota-2 for quite some time, before flicking their wrist, opening a Way and jumping through.>

<In that time frame, Agent Pearce retrieves a special gun and attaches a tracker to the figure's coat.>

<The Way closes behind them.>

 

PEARCE:

 

(breathes deeply)

 Anyone caught who that was?

LILLON:

 

(breathes deeply)

 Nope.

IOTA-2 | GECKO:

 Me neither.

 

<The other operatives shake their heads.>

 

PEARCE:

 

(sighs) Fizzlesticks.

 

[END LOG]

CONCLUSION:

 For yet unidentified reasons, the tracker ceased functioning upon the figure

3

 passing through the Way. Triangulation of the tracker is currently ongoing.

<Dr. Tula is inspecting SCP-8535 under a microscope. She is switching her sight from the microscope to an open book on volcanic rocks, and takes notes.>

<The door to the room slides open. Pearce enters. Dr. Tula does not avert her gaze.>

 

TULA:

 Didn't you see the sign that read, "Do not enter, unless you've got a burrito with you"?

 

<Pearce throws a burrito in a tin foil wrapper onto her desk. She looks at it in shock and surprise, before gladly taking the burrito.>

<Agent Pearce slumps onto a nearby sofa. He groans.>

 

TULA:

 Hard day at work?

PEARCE:

 No. Just a bunch of interviews.

TULA:

 A bunch?

PEARCE:

 Too many.

 

<Pearce lies prone on the sofa and rubs his eyes. He turns his head toward Dr. Tula.>

 

PEARCE:

 How's your job been doing?

TULA:

 Well, this little statue is about 11,000 years old, if that's what you're asking.

PEARCE:

 Exactly what I was asking.

 

<Pearce yawns.>

 

PEARCE:

 You ever get tired? Of working?

TULA:

 Yes.

PEARCE:

 So, why don't you just take a break, then?

TULA:

 Because it's a job that needs to be done.

PEARCE:

 Uncovering the many secrets of that statuette?

TULA:

 Yes. Uncovering the many secrets of that statuette. Very important and busy work.

 

<Pearce chuckles. He stands up and walks over to Dr. Tula.>

 

PEARCE:

 You know…

 

<He places his hands onto her shoulders and rubs them. Dr. Tula eases up a bit.>

 

PEARCE:

 I thought that maybe we could go on a vacation for a bit.

TULA:

 And put all the research on hold? No.

PEARCE:

 Come on, T.

 

<Pearce places kisses down along Dr. Tula's neck. She is pushing him off, but it is clear that she is not even trying. There is a smile on her face.>

 

PEARCE:

 

(quiet)

 Just the two of us. It'd be just like on that boat. A beautiful sunset. Splashing waves. And martinis. How's that sound, honey?

 

<Dr. Tula sits there in silence, deep in thought. She finally faces Pearce.>

 

TULA:

 You really want this?

PEARCE:

 If you're up for it.

 

<Dr. Tula nods. There is a sly smile forming on her face. She chuckles.>

 

PEARCE:

 What?

TULA:

 You know… it's been a while since we… you know…

PEARCE:

 

(feigning ignorance)

 What? What do you mean? I dunno what you're talking about…

TULA:

 Shut your mouth.

 

<Both Agent Pearce and Dr. Tula move toward the sofa. They kiss each other vigorously, enjoying the heat of the moment.>

<Pearce begins to strip Dr. Tula. She does the same on him.>

<They lie on the sofa.>

<[FOOTAGE REMOVED PER ETHICS COMMITTEE MANDATE]>

<Pearce and Tula are holding each other on the sofa. There is a light cover over them.>

<Tula kisses Pearce on the chest. He holds her. She moves away a bit.>

 

PEARCE:

 No, no. I just want to hold you like this a bit…

 

<Tula grins. She presses her face against his chest.>

 

TULA:

 This is nice.

PEARCE:

 

Yeah.

TULA:

 

(chuckles)

PEARCE:

 

(looks at her)

 What?

TULA:

 Don't ever say "yeah" again.

PEARCE:

 What? Why not?

TULA:

 

(laughs more)

 The way you just said it…

 

<Tula falls into a fit of laughter. Pearce laughs alongside her.>

<The laughter quiets down.>

 

PEARCE:

 I'll keep that in mind.

 

<The two just lie there, enjoying the silence and the comfort of each other.>

<Suddenly Pearce becomes nervous. He takes a deep breath. She notices.>

 

TULA:

 Hey. What's wrong?

PEARCE:

 Nothing. Just out of breath from chasing after a masked person along rooftops.

 

<Tula inspects Pearce. There is obviously something wrong.>

 

TULA:

 Bo, tell me.

 

<Tula looks concernedly at Pearce. Pearce takes a deep breath.>

<He stands up, puts on trousers and walks over to his jacket that is lying over a swivel chair. Tula coverse herself with the blanket.>

 

PEARCE:

 Tara, honey… there's something I've been meaning to ask you for a long time now… 

(quietly)

 Here goes…

 

<Pearce reaches into his jacket pocket. Tula looks at him intently.>

<Pearce retrieves a small black box out of his pocket. He opens the box to reveal a small ring inside.>

 

PEARCE:

 So, ehh… yeah. You wanna get married?

 

<Tula looks at Pearce in shock. She is utterly speechless. Pearce grows even more nervous.>

 

PEARCE:

 If you're not into that sort of thing, maybe we can, erm— I mean—

 

<Tula lunges at him and embraces him in a long, thoughtful kiss. Pearce, first taken aback, returns the gesture. Tula leans back. She looks into his eyes.>

 

TULA:

 Yes, Bokowitz. I wanna get married.

PEARCE:

 Really?

TULA:

 Yes!

 

<They kiss each other again, now even longer than before. She leans back again.>

 

TULA:

 

(gasps)

 We're gonna need organizers!

PEARCE:

 A bunch of them.

TULA:

 And food!

PEARCE:

 Can't get hungry on a marriage.

TULA:

 Who should we invite? How much is it gonna cost?

PEARCE:

 We'll figure something out, honey.

TULA:

 There must be some Skip that increases one's bank account!

PEARCE:

 Pretty sure there's one over at 19.

TULA:

 Oh, my God, this is so 

exciting

!

 

<Tula becomes all giddy. Pearce lifts her up and spins her around. Her hair flatters in the air.>

<Pearce sets her down again. She is pressed up against a table.>

 

TULA:

 Agent Pearce, you've just made me the happiest woman on earth.

PEARCE:

 And you've made 

me

 the happiest man in the world.

 

<Pearce leans in for a kiss again. She returns it.>

<The table they are pressing against wobbles under their movements. SCP-8535 is dangerously close to the edge.>

<Their movements only intensify. SCP-8535 is knocked off the table. It shatters upon impact. There is a green mist that emerges out of the remnants of the object, before it slowly dissipates.>

<Neither Agent Pearce, nor Dr. Tula notice the incident.>

<Dr. Tula releases herself from Agent Pearce.>

 

TULA:

 How long did you have that ring for?

PEARCE:

 One or two years.

TULA:

 That long? Why didn't you ask me sooner?

PEARCE:

 Well… I wasn't sure you'd say yes.

TULA:

 Well, you should've aske—

 

<Dr. Tula's mouth is wide agape. A green glow has possessed her eyes. She is muttering incoherent sentences.>

<Agent Pearce stumbles backward. He cannot believe what he is witnessing.>

<Pearce stands up and rushes at Tula. A shadowy force pushes him away, knocking him straight into lab equipment that shatters on impact. He lies prone on the floor.>

<Shadowy apparitions of spiders, as well as the hissing, manifest around the room, originating from Dr. Tula.>

<Agent Pearce awakens. He backs away.>

 

PEARCE:

 

(shouts)

 Tara!

 

<She is unresponsive. After a while, the spiders disappear and the noises cease.>

<Pearce stares emptily ahead.>

 

███:

 Are you capable of recounting the events of the night of March 26th?

 

<Pearce remains unresponsive. He does not even blink.>

 

███:

 An answer would be nice.

 

<Pearce looks up at Dr.

PEARCE:

 Where is she?

███:

 Dr. Tula? In the next room over, currently being evaluated by Dr. Lease.

PEARCE:

 Can I see her?

███:

 I'm afraid that's not an option. We are still unsure about her state.

PEARCE:

 Bullshit.

 

<Pearce stands up. Dr.

 ███ 

gestures for him to sit down again.>

 

PEARCE:

 Bullshit! You gotta let me see her. Now!

███:

 I'm sorry, Agent Pearce. I could talk with Dr. Lease for a possible meeting, but even that's difficult to arrang—

 

<Agent Pearce slams his fist on the table. It makes an audible clank.>

 

PEARCE:

 You fucking emotionless piece of shit.

 

<Pearce storms out of the interview room. Dr.

 ███ 

stands up, but stops at the door.>

 

███:

 Agent Pearce! Stop!

 

[HALLWAY CAM]

 

<Agent Pearce struds down the hallway, until he arrives at the next room over. He swipes his clearance card against the scanner and enters the room.>

 

[ROOM CAM]

 

<The interior is that of an observation room. The adjoining is room is completely dark. Despite this, it is evident that something is in the adjoining room.>

<In the room are Dr. Yung Lease and two armed guards. They immediately turn around upon Agent Pearce's entrance.>

<Dr. Lease holds up a hand to stop him.>

 

LEASE:

 Agent Pearce—

PEARCE:

 Tara…

LEASE:

 -is under the care of me and my research sector. Agent, I'm gonna request you to leave this area immediatel—

PEARCE:

 Go fuck yourself.

 

<Pearce walks past the doctor. The guards take a hold on Pearce. He continues on.>

 

PEARCE:

 

(mutters) I wanna see her…

LEASE:

 Agent, please—

PEARCE:

 Let me see her!

 

<The guards attempt to hold back Agent Pearce. He knocks one of them to the floor. The other backs off and immediately draws their weapon. They aim it at Agent Pearce.>

<Pearce remains still, staring at the guard.>

<Before the situation can escalate any further, a large human appendage, covered in hairs resembling those of a spider of the

 Theraphosidae 

family, hits the glass pane out from the darkness within.>

<Pearce is in utter disbelief of what he is witnessing. His mouth is agape, his eyes wide.>

 

PEARCE:

 N—no… she can't…

LEASE:

 SCP-8535. We will continue to monitor her progress, both physically, but also psychologically. Maybe we can even find a way to reverse her predicament.

PEARCE:

 

(ignores Dr. Lease)

 Tara!

 

<Pearce presses his body against the glass pane. His eyes frantically search about the dark interior.>

 

PEARCE:

 Honey, where are you? Everything's gonna be all right. I'm here. I'm here, honey!

 

<Tears start streaming down Pearce's eyes.>

<Dr. Lease approaches the agent.>

 

LEASE:

 I am deeply sorry, agent. I will do anything in my power to fix her.

 

<Pearce turns around.>

 

PEARCE:

 You better. You better fucking fix her!

 

<Pearce wipes the tears from his face. Dr. Lease can only nod.>

<Agent Pearce walks past Dr. Lease and the guards out through the door.>

<It is silent for a while.>

CONCLUSION:

 Agent Pearce put under psychological care. Dr. Tara N. Tula reclassified as SCP-8535. Dr. Yung Lease anointed new project lead.

 

APPENDIX [8535-007]

 

REPORT 8535-001

DATE:

 03/31/2025

Audio log 001 on the SCP-8535 project. Or simply SCP-8535. Dr. Tula. Her condition has significantly worsened from the previous day. Hairs cover about 85% of the body now, each strand reaching 10 centimeters at minimum, 25 on maximum. Growth of additional appendages has only increased drastically; the second appendage has already finished its growth, an additional set of arms is already forming on the sides of her abdomen.

Attempted questioning today. Although she answered rudimentary "yes or no" questions, capacity for higher thought has seemingly been hampered. Subject reacts with human behavior when in the presence of objects once significant to her (lab equipment, engagement ring, etc.). She displays the greatest reaction whenever Agent Bokowitz Pearce is mentioned. Will continue monitoring.

 

REPORT 8535-002

DATE:

 04/05/2025

The first set of mandibles has developed on the outer edges of subject's mouth. Arms have fully formed. Hairs are covering the entirety of her body now. It doesn't look pleasant. Had an incident today. When the standard dietary regimen was provided to it, SCP-8535 reacted with hostility. It then proceeded to use the rations to paint symbols and markings on the chamber's walls. Already asked Linguistics about this; they've got no clue either.

Cognitive abilities have regressed drastically. Subject shows an aversion to light. Objects that once held meaning to the subject garner no reaction from the subject anymore.

Staff have complained of visual and auditory hallucinations of smaller tarantula specimens within the chamber. Checked the area. Found nothing.

 

REPORT 8535-003

DATE:

 04/13/2025

There is nothing left of the human that once was. Subject now resembles a giant humanoid tarantula specimen. All cognition tests have proven futile. Subject reacts with aggression exclusively and nothing more.

I'm starting to believe euthanasia might be the best thing we can do.

DELLEN:

 Agent Pearce. I'm going to ask you to leave.

PEARCE:

 Director, you must understand, she—

DELLEN:

 We are doing the best we can, agent. Please exit my office at once.

PEARCE:

 No! You don't understand! Let me see her just 

once

!

DELLEN:

 If you do not cease this behavior, agent, then I'm gonna see myself forced to transfer you to another—

 

<Dr. Lease enters. He is holding a document in his hands.>

 

LEASE:

 Director, a report just came in.

 

<Director Dellen looks at Pearce, then at the document.>

 

DELLEN:

 What is this?

LEASE:

 We were able to triangulate the tracker attached to PoI-8535-A. We know their last known location.

DELLEN:

 Shoot. Any teams sent out yet?

LEASE:

 That's why I came to you for.

 

<Director Dellen looks onto Agent Pearce. He just nods silently.>

 

DELLEN:

 Good. We better start the expedition today. God knows how long the tracker's been sitting there, they could already be gon—

<Agent Lillon stands guard in front of the door to the SCP-8535 observation chamber. A set of guards walk past him in the hallway.>

 

GUARD 1:

 You've heard of the chick that turned into a spider? Fucked up, man.

GUARD 2:

 Yeah, I've heard of her. It kept here?

GUARD 1:

 I've heard that she's being contained in this sector.

GUARD 2:

 That's disgusting, bro. They really should just put a bullet through its brain.

GUARD 1:

 You think so?

GUARD 2:

 Damn right, I think so! Can't have a giant spider person runnin' around laying giant spider people eggs!

GUARD 1:

 You're probably right.

 

<Lillon approaches the guards, hesitates, then decides not to do anything. The guards turn around a corner. Lillon sighs.>

<The door to the observation room opens. Dr. Lease exits through. He appears to be in a hurry.>

 

LILLON:

 Doctor…

LEASE:

 Not right now.

LILLON:

 Doctor, please!

LEASE:

 Not now! I need to speak with the Director!

 

<Dr. Lease turns around a corner.>

<Lillon sighs. He turns to look through the open doorway into the SCP-8535 observation room. Despite his worries, he ventures inside.>

<The interior is dimly lit. What little light there is comes from a small desk lamp close to the glass pane that allows a view into the closed-off containment chamber of SCP-8535.>

<Lillon carefully looks around. He sees notes quickly scribbled on, reports on various arachnid specimens and pictures of tarantulas taped onto the walls.>

<He approaches the glass pane. He attempts to look through it, but then he notices that there is a thin layer of a white substance coating the interior. He takes a closer look.>

<He takes the desk lamp and holds it against the glass pane. His eyes strain, the substance glistening in the lamp's light.>

<Suddenly, a large arachnid appendage smashes against the window. The black-brown patterns of its fur are clearly visible through the silk. The appendage streaks out of view.>

<Agent Lillon flinches. He nearly drops the lamp. He places it down, suddenly racked with the feeling that he should not be here.>

<Another appendage smashes against the window, this one even larger than the previous. Lillon backs away; he has seen enough.>

<More appendages smash against the window, each smash heavier and more intense than the last. A crack forms on the glass pane.>

<Lillon begins to really panic now. He takes out his firearm and aims it at the pane.>

<It is dead silent for a while. Nothing occurs.>

<Then the glass shatters into thousands of fragments as SCP-8535 bursts through it. Lillon attempts to fire, but SCP-8535 knocks him to the floor beforehand.>

<They get pushed out into the hallway. In the bright light, SCP-8535 is clearly visible now; a giant tarantula that nearly reaches to the ceiling, fur as thick as a human head, attempting to stand upright in a misshapen humanoid form.>

<Eight green glowing eyes stare down at Agent Lillon, as SCP-8535 opens its mandibles to reveal rows of human teeth inside its mouth.>

<Lillon tries to push SCP-8535 off, but it is apparent that the entity is stronger than him.>

<SCP-8535 smashes his head against the floor, causing a gush of blood to trickle down the side of his head, before unleashing its mandibles and biting into Agent Lillon's exposed neck. He is barely conscious to scream out in pain.>

<More security details arrive, including Dr. Lease and Agent Pearce, the latter unable to process what he is seeing.>

<Dr. Lease looks onto the entity in horror. Eventually he snaps out of it.>

 

LEASE:

 Fire!

 

<A hail of bullets rains onto SCP-8535. Agent Pearce attempts to do something, anything, but is too shocked to even move.>

<SCP-8535 turns around; the silk coating on its back shields it from gunfire.>

<Agent Lillon begins to convulse on the floor. He froths out a green substance from his mouth. His pupils turn completely black.>

<Agent Lillon develops two additional sets of arms. Black-brown fur begins to cover the entirety of his body. Mandibles grow around his mouth area. He has eight eyes now. He has been fully transformed into a specimen like SCP-8535.>

<Agent Lillon rapidly stands up and lunges at the security detail. He dismembers one of them viciously. Their screams echo through the hallways.>

 

LEASE:

 Fall back! Fall back!

 

<Security flees the area.>

<SCP-8535 turns around and charges at them, quickly crawling on eight misbent legs.>

<Pearce puts himself between the personnel and SCP-8535. He shakily takes his firearm and aims. His hands are shaking as he is unable to shoot at the entity. He then fires, all the while looking away. SCP-8535 hisses, then rams through Agent Pearce, knocking him to the floor. There is a dent in the wall.>

<Security personnel take shots at the entity as they flee. It is quickly catching up to them.>

<SCP-8535 catches up to Dr. Lease, whom it grabs by the leg and bites just as Agent Lillon. It drops him to the floor, where he writhes in agony and slowly transforms.>

<Sirens sound. Red emergency lights flicker on. A lockdown has been initiated.>

<SCP-8535 looks around, gives out an ear piercing shriek, before quickly fleeing the area. It produces loud hissing sounds, which cause the other specimens (tentatively designated SCP-8535-002 & SCP-8535-003) to follow after SCP-8535.>

<Security arrives. They transport all survivors, including Agent Pearce, out of the sector.>

 

[END LOG]

CONCLUSION:

 On a subsequent search, SCP-8535 and its specimens could not be located anywhere on the grounds of Site-67. Review of security camera footage and eyewitness accounts indicate that SCP-8535 and the specimens have escaped the facility.

Measures to locate the specimens have been made a top priority.

MTF INVOLVED:

 Mobile Task Force Iota-2 ("Longest Legs")

FOREWORD:

 To gain more insight into the nature of SCP-8535, MTF Iota-2 was sent to the last known location of PoI-8535-A.

[BEGIN LOG]

 

<Iota-2 struds through the thick vegetation of the rain forest. The leaves are a fresh green, the bark thick and brown. Noises of animals in the distance chirp through the branches, the dew dropping to the dirt ground where it is absorbed.>

<Agent Pearce looks carefully around. Another operative behind him is holding up a device in their hands.>

 

PEARCE:

 We're getting close to the destination. Keep your eyes peeled. If there's any more of them than at the Portlands, then we need to be cautious.

 

<Agent Pearce passes by a tarantula that is sitting on a leaf. He quickly averts his gaze, clearly upset. They arrive at a clearing.>

 

IOTA-2 | GECKO:

 The tracker's malfunctioning, sir.

PEARCE:

 Malfunctioning? How?

IOTA-2 | GECKO:

 I don't know. I'm working on it.

PEARCE:

 Well, work on it quick, because these people we're looking for will quickly know we're here—

 

<Iota-2 | Post drops to the ground. A dart is sticking out of his neck.>

<Another dart flies. It hits operative Iota-2 | Charlie in the neck. Soon all Iota-2 operatives are dispatched by darts to their necks. Agent Pearce looks around haphazardly. Brief flashes of people in the bushes and foliage zip past him.>

<A dart hits his neck. He winces. He is conscious long enough to pry the dart out of his neck, look at it, and collapsing to the ground.>

<Once he is unconscious, a group of people emerge from the vegetation. They are dressed in light garments, seemingly hand-made from the flora in the region. Each of them has paint adorning their faces and chest, designed like the legs of various spider species. They drag Agent Pearce and the rest of Iota-2 off.>

<Skip 00hrs 13min 23secs.>

<Pearce awakens strapped to a chair. There are several small statuettes of various spider species standing about. Several natives surround him, all eyeing him curiously. When he opens his eyes all of them coil back in terror. They speak to each other in an unknown language.>

 

PEARCE:

 

(weakly)

 What… what is this bull…

 

<The natives disperse. Out of a yurt steps an elderly figure. Their markings resemble those of a tarantula. On their chest rests a mask; a mask identical to the one of PoI-8535-A. They sit down in front of Agent Pearce. They look at him intently.>

 

PEARCE:

 

(weakly)

 What do you want… what have you done to my men—

 

<PoI-8535-A presses a bowl filled with a glowing liquid against Pearce's mouth.>

 

PEARCE:

 What is tha—

POI-8535-A:

 Drink.

 

<Pearce reluctantly obliges. After consuming the liquid, Pearce appears to be revitalized. He takes a deep breath in and out.>

 

PEARCE:

 Wow, I… thank you—

 

<PoI-8535-A holds up his hand. Pearce becomes quiet.>

 

POI-8535-A:

 You should not be here.

PEARCE:

 We came here for help. My—

POI-8535-A:

 I will send you back to where you came from.

 

<PoI-8535-A waves his arms. A Way opens up in front of him.>

 

PEARCE:

 No, wait— Wait!

POI-8535-A:

 Goodbye.

PEARCE:

 No! Just let me— 

(shouts)

 It's your fault!

 

<Everyone grows quiet.>

 

PEARCE:

 My girlfriend… honey— Tara. She's been turned into something inhuman by a little statue. I don't know how. I don't know why. Just… please. Please help her.

 

<PoI-8535-A remains silent. He approaches Agent Pearce.>

 

POI-8535-A:

 Our fault? Our fault that 

your

 people stole from us an artefact of our religion centuries ago? To be sold? To be put on a shelf as a trophy? Whose fault is it now? My people's?

 

<PoI-8535-A stares Agent Pearce directly in the eyes. He averts his gaze. Pearce cannot look at him. PoI-8535-A turns away again.>

 

PEARCE:

 He was your son, wasn't he?

 

<PoI-8535-A becomes still. He does not move even by an inch.>

 

PEARCE:

 The man who lived in Three Portlands. The assailant at the auction. I'm sorry. I truly am. I cannot imagine what you're going through. I'm sorry what has been done to your people. I'm sorry. But please. Help me save her. Please…

 

<Tears begin to form in Agent Pearce's eyes. PoI-8535-A looks hesitant. He takes a deep breath.>

 

POI-8535-A:

 There's nothing I can do… She's been possessed by 

Unglott

. Once a deity of procreation and prosperity, now, after being separated from its fellow brothers and sisters and people for so long, a mere shadow of what they once were. Evil has festered within them and it slowly seeped into the deepest poures of Unglott. Corrupted them. Mutilated them.

PEARCE:

 

(stammers)

 What?

POI-8535-A:

 I am so sorry.

PEARCE:

 You're— you're sorry? You're fucking sorry? Fix her! Fix her, you motherfucking piece of 

shit

! Bring her back!

 

<Agent Pearce is in a full rage now. Their yells and attempts at breaking free from the restraints is only broken by the sobs and cries. PoI-8535-A closes his eyes.>

<Moments later, Agent Pearce and the rest of Iota-2 reappear within the confines of Site-67. Agent Pearce writhes on the floor, a sobbing mess. Eventually his sobbing quiets down. He hides his face in his hands.>

 

[END LOG]

CONCLUSION:

 Subsequent searches of the area revealed the remnants of a village with recent signs of habitation. No hints as to PoI-8535-A's and his people's current whereabouts could be located.

 Shut the fuck up.

GUARD 1:

 Damn. Okay.

 Jesus Christ!

GUARD 2:

 Fuck!

 Just drive, motherfucker!

GUARD 1:

 Shit!

 

<The entity tears the entire roof off. It bites down on the guard's head. Muffled screams echo through the night.>

<The convoy tips over. SCP-8535 jumps off of it beforehand.>

<It lets go of the guard. The guard is already transforming into another specimen.>

<SCP-8535 approaches the convoy. It rips open the back doors to allow access within. In the interior lays SCP-107,

 which it picks up.>

LOCATION:

 Foundation Research Site-67

FOREWORD:

 On the abovementioned date, SCP-8535, along with several other specimens, had appeared within the location of interest Three Portlands. The specimens quickly began to assault, convert and overwhelm citizens and local law enforcement of the area.

To prevent harm to the wider world, several Foundation detachments were sent to handle the threat posed by these specimens, one of them being Mobile Task Force Iota-2.

Despite this, however, Iota-2 captain Agent Bokowitz Pearce had remained unresponsive to contact, with no other member being aware of their whereabouts.

[BEGIN LOG]

 

<Interior is that of Dr. Tula's former laboratory. There is a dim desk lamp light in the corner she used to work at. In the corner sits Agent Pearce, slumped over and broken. There is a glass and a few empty bottles on the counter.>

<The silence is broken once Director Dellen hurriedly enters the office.>

 

DELLEN:

 Hell be damned, there you are! I've been searching all over for you! Don't you check your phone anymore?

 

<Pearce does not respond. He stares at the glass.>

 

DELLEN:

 It's helter skelter in the Three Ports! The UIU's been flooding all our messaging systems for assistance. Hell, the GOC's, too!

PEARCE:

 

(ignores director)

 She's gone. She's gone and it's all my fault.

 

<Director Dellen, first confused and irritated, shuts up. He shakes his head and sighs.>

 

DELLEN:

 Oh, Pearce… We need your help. Now. Or many people will get hurt!

PEARCE:

 I asked her to marry me, you know?

 

<Pearce reaches into his pocket and retrieves the engagement ring. He rolls the engagement ring in his fingers. It glistens in the dim light. Tears roll down the sides of his face.>

 

PEARCE:

 She said yes.

DELLEN:

 

(taken aback)

 Okay, Pearce, I am greatly sorry for what happened to Dr. Tula. But right now, the most densely populated anomalous location with the most connections to the wider Earth public is being overrun by human-sized tarantulas, and if we don't act now, there won't be a chance for it later!

PEARCE:

 

(chuckles weakly, clearly drunk)

 It doesn't matter what I do anymore… She's gone.

DELLEN:

 

(grunts)

 Oh, for Christ's sake! Fine! Wallow in your own self-pity, I don't care! The world will prevent itself from an LK-Class Dominance Shift scenario, then!

 

<Director Dellen heads toward the door.>

 

DELLEN:

 Don't drown in that bottle. Knew a guy once.

LAMBDA-12 | RATS:

 I don't know. And I'm not gonna fuck around to find out.

IOTA-2 | GECKO:

 

(mutters)

 It wants all of us.

IOTA-2 | CHARLIE:

 What are you on about?

IOTA-2 | GECKO:

 Haven't you read the logs? Dr. Tula has been possessed by Unglott, the spider god of procreation… and now that it is hateful, it's view has been corrupted, it wants to turn all of us…

IOTA-2 | POST:

 But why 107?

IOTA-2 | GECKO:

 How does 8535 transform beings into tarantulas?

LAMBDA-12 | RATS:

 Analysis has shown it to be due to some sort of venom—

 

<Everyone grows quiet. Loud banging and thrashing emanates from the end of one of the hallways.>

<All personnel raise their weapons.>

 

LAMBDA-12 | RATS:

 What the…

IOTA-2 | GECKO:

 Ma'am, what is at the end of that hallway?

ROBOTIC WOMAN:

 It's the restrooms, sir. Anderson Robotics only provides the most high-tech flushing and hygiene systems for employees and clients alik—

 

<A barrage of SCP-8535 specimens bursts out the door. They screech and howl, and crawl along all surfaces. The MTF soldiers unleash fire upon them.>

<Out of the swarm emerges SCP-8535 itself, distinct from other specimens by its glowing green eyes. The entity is holding SCP-107 in its lower set of mandibles.>

<The entity stares with its eight eyes directly at the members of Iota-2. They train their fire on the entity.>

<SCP-8535 shrieks away in pain. It grapples onto the ceiling, pries off a vent cover and squeezes inside.>

 

LAMBDA-12 | RATS:

 God almigthy! How big is that vent?!

ROBOTIC WOMAN:

 Anderson Robtics vents™ are designed for our specialized robotic units to fit through, which are designed to complete any task—

 

<A specimen rips off the head of the robotic assistant. The MTF units move toward the elevator.>

 

LAMBDA-12 | RATS:

 The stairs will take too long. We gotta get up there quickly!

 

<The units board the elevator. As the button to the top floor is pressed, a specimen lunges at Lambda-12 | Rats. It grapples him by the leg and pulls him outside.>

 

IOTA-2 | GECKO:

 Rats!

 

<Lambda-12 | Rats screams. He is quickly assaulted and transforms into another specimen. The elevator doors finally close. They are heading up.>

<The Iota-2 members are in deep shock. None of them says a word.>

<Something rattles above them. The noises of heavy steps and many legs tapping onto the floor is audible. The Iota-2 members look upward.>

<A specimen bursts through the ceiling. It viciously assaults one of its members. They shoot at the creature, which howls and shrieks, before collapsing onto the floor.>

<Its blood melts through the floor and one of the personnel. They dissolve into a puddle of viscera and blood. The others back away into a corner as far as they can.>

 

IOTA-2 | GECKO:

 

(breathes heavily)

 Y'all all right?

 

<Iota-2 | Charlie nods. Iota-2 | Post remains silent.>

<Iota-2 arrives at the top floor. Immediately upon exiting, Iota-2 | Post gets attacked by a specimen, identified as SCP-8535-003. It gnaws at his face and rips chunks of his chest out. The others quickly flee.>

<As they reach and climb the stairs to the roof of the tower, SCP-8535-002 bursts through a flight of stairs directly underneath Iota-2 | Charlie. She screams in agony, as she is dragged into the floor below. Iota-2 | Gecko proceeds up the stairs toward the roof.>

<He finally manages to reach the top. An open vent cover lies right next to him. He looks up to see SCP-8535 on a pole, SCP-107 in hand. Surrounding the entity is a vast array of Ways all leading to various parts of the Earth. The entity attempts to retch into SCP-107.>

<Clearly exhausted and dazed, Iota-2 | Gecko takes out his firearm and shoots SCP-8535. The entity recoils in pain and drops SCP-107. The entity stares angrily at Iota-2 | Gecko.>

<The entity lunges at him. He closes his eyes, already having accepted his fate. Then SCP-8535 is knocked away in the air. Iota-2 | Gecko opens his eyes, confused.>

<Helicopters arrive on the top of the tower. On one of them is Agent Pearce, who had taken the shot to knock off SCP-8535 mid-air with a rifle.>

<Iota-2 | Gecko is speechless.>

 

PEARCE:

 Kid, get out of here! We'll handle the situation.

 

<Mass amounts of soldiers of MTF Nu-7 land on the rooftop, surrounding a dazed SCP-8535. They train their weapons at it. Agent Pearce gestures for them to hold their fire.>

 

NU-7 | BETA:

 What? We don't take orders from him!

PEARCE:

 Director Dellen has appointed me second in command. So you better shut up or you'll get demoted to D-Class!

 

<Nu-7 | Beta remains silent.>

<Agent Pearce approaches the wounded SCP-8535. He kneels down before it and reaches out a hand at it. It recoils and shrieks in terror.>

 

PEARCE:

 Woah! Hey, hey…

 

<Pearce brushes the top of the entity's head. Tears begin to form in his eyes. He smiles.>

 

PEARCE:

 You really let yourself go, huh?

 

<There is a low, yet non-aggressive growl from SCP-8535. It eases at his touch slightly.>

 

PEARCE:

 Come on. Let's get you back home.

 

<Soldiers approach SCP-8535. At their sight, the entity immediately begins to shriek and run toward SCP-107.>

 

PEARCE:

 Tara, no!

 

<The entity acquires SCP-107 by knocking a few soldiers over the edge of the roof. It is fired upon, but it takes the hits as it begins to retch into SCP-107. Pearce runs at the entity.>

<Before it can retch into the object, however, a green glow manifests beside it. Out of it come several masked people, one of them being PoI-8535-A. They restrain SCP-8535 with thaumic whips.>

<Pearce is at a loss for words.>

 

POI-8535-A:

 Take the shell!

 

<Pearce runs toward the entity and retrieves SCP-107 off of it. He immediately begins to run the opposite direction.>

<SCP-8535 visibly struggles against its restraints. A shadowy mass begins to seep out from SCP-8535.>

<The entity shrieks loudly. Out of it emerges a shadowy mass that quickly envelops the entire roof and sky. Out of that mass emerges the face of a tarantula with giant glowing green eyes. It looks down upon the entire city. PoI-8535-A is greatly disturbed at the sight, near motionless.>

<The mass hisses loudly. A whirlwind of shadows is generated from the top of the tower. It knocks back all people on it.>

<Amidst the shadowy mass and chaos stands Dr. Tula, exposed down to her bare skin, head slumped back, arms outstretched. She is levitating several centimeters off the floor.>

 

PEARCE:

 Tara!

 

<Pearce attempts to stand in the chaos. He can barely get close to her.>

 

PEARCE:

 Tara! Look at me!

 

<She is unresponsive, as if she cannot hear Agent Pearce.>

<Pearce manages to get close to her. He is inches away from touching her.>

 

PEARCE:

 

(shouts)

 Look at me! Tara, look at me!

TULA:

 

(coarse)

 Leave… me…

PEARCE:

 Tara! You remember that day? On the boat?

*TULA:** 

(coarse)

 No… please…

PEARCE:

 It was the day we first met. I asked you out on a martini, under splashing waves of the ocean and a beautiful sunset. Remember?

TULA:

 

(coarse)

 No… no…

PEARCE:

 And the way you laughed. Oh, it was horrible. Like a dying parrot. That was when I knew that you were gonna be the woman I would want to spend the rest of my life with.

TULA:

 Stop… 

(normal voice, tearful)

 Stop…

PEARCE:

 And the ring.

 

<Pearce pulls out the engagement ring.>

 

PEARCE:

 You said yes.

TULA:

 N— 

(coarse)

 No!

PEARCE:

 Yes! Yes! I love you. I always loved you. And I always will. Please, Tara…

 

<Dr. Tula's head is bowed. Pearce finally touches her. He lifts it up, so that their eyes are meeting.>

 

PEARCE:

 Come back. Please.

 

<There is a sudden reverberation of all surrounding noise. Dr. Tula screams out in reverse, causing the shadowy apparition to retract back into her body. Her screams and cries are accompanied by the loud hissing noise of a million tarantulas.>

<Tula slumps back in on herself. She is crying. She falls to the floor. Pearce tends to her. Tula embraces him in a tight hug, crying a river.>

 

PEARCE:

 

(tearful)

 Tara. Oh, my God, Tara…

TULA:

 

(tearful)

 I will always love you. Always. But I can't stay.

PEARCE:

 

(tearful)

 W—what?

TULA:

 I will always love you.

 

<Tula reaches out to kiss Pearce on the lips. The last kiss they will ever have. Tears run down along the side of their faces. Their tears land in SCP-107.>

<The tears cause SCP-107 to activate. Its outer rim glows a bright red, and the entire city is immediately beset with rainfall.>

<The rain causes all transformed people to revert back to their original states. Thousands upon millions transform back.>

<The man and the homeless woman transform back. Dr. Lease and Agent Lillon transform back.>

<Tula lets go of Pearce. He looks onto her for one last time.>

 

TULA:

 Don't come looking for me. Live your life. Promise me.

PEARCE:

 I—I…

TULA:

 Goodbye.

 

<Tula retreats back. She transforms back into her animalistic SCP-8535 form. It writhes around in utter confusion and pain.>

<It looks onto Agent Pearce. There is a knowing exchange in stares between the two. SCP-8535 quickly snaps out of it. It hisses, before running off into a Way and disappearing once it closes behind it.>

<Pearce stares on ahead. He can barely process what has just transpired. The whirlwind demanifests. Everyone slowly recovers. PoI-8535-A puts a hand on Pearce's shoulder. Pearce turns around. PoI-8535-A is smiling. Pearce returns the smile.>

CONCLUSION:

 Following Incident 8535-α, clean-up operations were conducted on the entirety of the Three Portlands location by the combined efforts of the Foundation, the Global Occult Coalition and Unusual Incidents Unit.

Resources for the subsequent rebuilding efforts were transferred to the Mayor, while a large majority of the citizenry was amnesticized upon request. Medical expenses to any injured were also provided.

Subsequent searches immediately after the incident could not locate PoI-8535-A, nor any hints as to the whereabouts of SCP-8535. All Foundation units were subsequently retracted from the location.

<The medical wing is stocked to the brim with doctors and agents. Agent Pearce is talking to a doctor indistinctly. The doctor nods. They point to one of the beds. He thanks the doctor, then walks toward the bed.>

<On the beds lays Agent Sam Lillon. He is tattered up and hooked to medical equipment. He has his eyes closed. Despite this, he senses Pearce's presence. He opens his eyes, looks at Agent Pearce and smiles. Pearce smiles back.>

 

PEARCE:

 Hey, kid.

LILLON:

 I never thought I'd see your face through only one set of eyes ever again.

PEARCE:

 

(chuckles)

 You all right?

LILLON:

 Yeah. It was an experience, man.

PEARCE:

 One you came back from fairly unfazed, I see.

LILLON:

 

(chuckles)

 If you say so, sir.

 

<There is a silence between them.>

 

LILLON:

 Are you all right?

PEARCE:

 I had one hell of an experience, too.

LILLON:

 I hope everything turns out fine in the end.

PEARCE:

 What doesn't?

LILLON:

 Season finales. Or book endings. Stephen King knows best.

 

<Pearce smiles.>

 

PEARCE:

 I'll be seeing you.

 

<Agent Pearce waves Agent Lillon goodbye. He leaves.>

<Out in the hallway, he looks around. Director Dellen walks by him.>

 

DELLEN:

 

(into earpiece)

 -and tell the goddamn 

Clever Girls

 to—

 

<The Director notices Agent Pearce. He stops in his tracks, presses a button on his earpiece and turns to the agent.>

DELLEN:

 Agent Pearce!

PEARCE:

 Director.

DELLEN:

 Hey, I never thanked you for what you did back there.

PEARCE:

 Only did my duty.

DELLEN:

 Sure you did. You wanna go grab a beer sometime? Off-hours, of course.

PEARCE:

 Maybe sometime.

DELLEN:

 All right. Take care, agent.

 

<The Director begins walking again. Pearce looks at him.>

 

PEARCE:

 Hey!

 

<Director Dellen stops again.>

 

PEARCE:

 Sorry for refusing. To help. I think I was drunk back there…

 

<Director Dellen smiles.>

 

DELLEN:

 Don't be sorry. 

(spreads arms)

 You saved the world. Now, if you'd excuse me, I gotta go back on some cretaceous business.

 

<Director Dellen hurries down the hallway again, talking indistinctly into his earpiece. Pearce smiles. He takes a stroll down the hallways.>

<He arrives at the door to Dr. Tula's laboratory. He contemplates it for a moment, before he decides to enter.>

<The laboratory is noticeably more empty than before. All of Dr. Tula's lab equipment has been put into a large cardboard box sitting on the countertop. He eyes the laboratory for a moment.>

<On the countertop next to the box sits the engagement ring. He eyes it and fondles it in his hands. Everything is silent for a moment. He smiles.>

<The P.A. system chimes on overhead.>

 

P.A. SYSTEM:

 Agent Bokowitz Pearce, your immediate assistance is requested. Please head to the director's office. Thank you.

 

<The P.A. system chimes off again. Agent Pearce chuckles. He puts the engagement ring into the box.>

<Agent Bokowitz Pearce takes the box and leaves.>
