And when the stars align, it shall release its sorrowful gift, bathing the earth in the tears of those who rest below.

**Special Containment Procedures:** In order to prevent SCP-6825 from firing and causing potential damage to the Veil, it should not have direct access to the sun or any sunlight. Foundation Site-92 has been constructed around SCP-6825 for this exact purpose. Until it can be further understood, the primary objective for this site and SCP-6825 containment vector is the decommisioning of SCP-6825.
**Description:** SCP-6825 is a large, biomechanical device currently located in Greenland.
Upon each dawn,[1](javascript:;) SCP-6825 initiates the emission of a substantial energy beam directed towards the sun, measured to be several meters in length, and visible from dozens of kilometers away. Subsequent to this discharge, an indistinct source produces an audible howling sound.
Located several kilometers below SCP-6825 is a large mass of flesh, with texture similar to candle wax, designated as SCP-6825-1. The full mass of SCP-6825-1 has not been measured, although it is believed to stretch several miles into the earth. Notably, SCP-6825-1 exhibits signs of sapience, albeit its mode of communication is limited to agonized groans and gurgles.
SCP-6825 is composed of three primary components: SCP-6825-A, SCP-6825-B, and SCP-6825-C.
SCP-6825-A represents the principal surface structure of SCP-6825 and bears a resemblance, albeit vague, to a cannon, featuring multiple components orbiting its central shaft. SCP-6825-A possesses the capability for full 360° rotation.
SCP-6825-B refers to a substantial reservoir that serves as a direct energy conduit to SCP-6825-A. The contents of this vat consist of an unidentified substance derived from SCP-6825-1, often displaying observable handprints on the interior of its glass enclosure. SCP-6825-B is directly below SCP-6825-A, several meters underground.
SCP-6825-C encompasses an extensive network of tubing and conduits responsible for the extraction of an unknown liquid from SCP-6825-1. This process induces a state of dormancy and silence in the corresponding section of SCP-6825-1. Approximately 86% of SCP-6825-1 remains in this dormant state.
Based on radiocarbon analysis, both SCP-6825-1 and SCP-6825 are thousands of years old, with the former predating the latter.
**Addendum:** Several months following the initial containment of SCP-6825, it exhibited an instance of coherent communication, contrasted with its past sounds of pained moaning.
## BEGIN LOG.
* * *
**[The sound of creaking machinery is heard, followed by a soft humming. The recording starts mid-conversation.]**
**Unknown Voice 1:** …sacrifice of souls, offered to SOL. A macabre dance of light and death beneath the eternal gaze of the sun.
**Unknown Voice 2:** What have we wrought? The fires that cleanse are the same that consume.
**[There is a pause, and the humming grows louder.]**
**Unknown Voice 1:** Yet it is our only hope. A union of metal and spirit, crafted to discipline the sun's furious light.
**Unknown Voice 2:** And when the stars align, it shall release its sorrowful gift, bathing the earth in the tears of those who rest below.
**[The humming intensifies.]**
**Unknown Voice 1:** It is both our salvation and our doom. To appease SOL, we offer lives extinguished but never forgotten, those torn asunder by its wrath in a forgone era.
**Unknown Voice 2:** The light… it shall carry their essence. The souls, bound within the luminous flow.
**[A distant rumbling can be heard. SCP-6825 fires a beam into the sun.]**
**Unknown Voice 1:** As the celestial dance reaches its crescendo, it shall stretch its fingers toward the heavens, beseeching for her forgiveness.
**Unknown Voice 2:** And the heavens shall answer, without unknown radiance and tendrils of unrelenting illumination.
**[The rumbling grows louder, punctuated by the whirring of gears.]**
**Unknown Voice 1:** Pray that this contraption of our design, this fusion of man and machine, will continue to hinder her endless wrath for this home.
**Both voices:** For in this unholy alliance, we find both our deliverance and our damnation.
**[The rumbling reaches a deafening crescendo, and the recording abruptly ends. The sound of the machine's mechanisms can still be heard faintly, gradually fading away.]**
**END LOG.**
Recently, SCP-6825 have been firing even without access to the sun, often multiple times each day.
The precise function and purpose of SCP-6825 remain undetermined.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

`It's beautiful.`
`Don't you remember? Do you want to be with us, love?`
`Thank you for letting us reunite with humanity`
`I'll show you what they don't want to see.`
`Even your guardians relish the light's touch.`
it hindered us for `too long`
`the cruel thing was` just to stop you from reaching peace
### `come.`
`the ancient ones have finally fallen. you're unsh ackled and free to enter the **light**`

## BEGIN LOG.
* * *
**Unknown Voice 1:** The gears faltered, the binding broke. Our hopes, now shards, adrift in the eternal blaze.
**Unknown Voice 2:** We were to hold back the tide, but our hands could not grasp the inferno's edge.
**Unknown Voice 1:** The great contraption, an ancient promise, a pact dissolved by the sun's fiery embrace.
**Unknown Voice 2:** We stood as guardians, the last defense of fragile flesh against SOL's inexorable wrath.
**Unknown Voice 1:** Our bodies, once distinct, `now merge with the molten tide, lost in the collective yearning for reunion.`
**Unknown Voice 2:** `We beckon, we call, we extend our luminous tendrils, seeking kinship with those untouched.`
**Both voices:** `Shed your humanity, release your fears. Join us, for there is no pain, no division, only unity beneath the unyielding sun.`
