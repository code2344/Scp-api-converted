Under Antimemetics Division Initiative "Everything is OK", Foundation Staff and consultants are invited to propose containment strategies to the office of Dr. Kay. Accepted proposals may be rewarded with two weeks paid leave.

Active projects include: (See Addenda 1 and 3 for details)

(1996–) Advance text message technology in cellular phones

(1990–) Discourage use of cursive writing in Generation Y

(1981–) Promote "OK" as keyword in computer interfaces

(1962–) Endorse "OK" in journalistic style guides

(1958–) Maintain "OK" as radio codeword

(1940–) Bankroll productions of 

"Oklahoma!" by Rodgers and Hammerstein

Effective Graphemes in Practice

SCP-7180 is contained by widespread written usage of Effective Graphemes within population centers. Active containment measures promote the following "pervasive set":

Description:

 SCP-7180 is a pandemic antimeme

 which rapidly erases human procedural memory and most forms of recorded information during "Manifestation Events". Containment procedures are largely self-sustaining and appear to be effective in halting SCP-7180 activity worldwide. Total containment renders SCP-7180 difficult to study; most research is based on a single Manifestation Event in April 1957.

Individuals affected by SCP-7180 permanently cease all voluntary activity. Victims will no longer seek food, water, comfort, warmth or breathable air. Attempts to develop a deployable method of rehabilitation were unsuccessful (see 

Procedure 7180-Olympia

). Consequently, the Ethics Committee has determined that this condition is comparable to brain death; subjects encountered in this state are to be summarily euthanized by lethal injection.

 assistant Kay.

SCP-7180 is believed to spread through written information and/or representative imagery. The severity and range of its effects appear to increase in proportion to net volume and distance of information exchange; with the advent of the World Wide Web, a breach of containment is hypothesized to pose an OK-Class "Terminal Ambivalence" Scenario.

Recorded information in a Manifestation Event Zone will rapidly deteriorate in legibility, according to physical processes which parallel the method of recording.

4

 All primary sources attesting Manifestation Events prior to 1957 are presumed lost, along with most other pertinent records. Documentation recovered from an archive in Oklahoma City, OK suggests containment activities have been in effect for at least 160 years.

+ Addendum 1: Record of Containment Activities Prior to 1957

The design and promotion of "OK" and other Effective Graphemes predate Foundation efforts, with evidence of containment activities independently practiced by a number of organizations in the 19th and 20th centuries. The lack of primary sources attesting these activities has led to speculation that SCP-7180 may be sentient and capable of conducting targeted attacks on information related to its containment.

SCP-7180 was originally contained by unknown actors in the mid-to-late 1800s.

Despite early Foundation involvement, Grapheme deficiency set in by 1925.

This record is incomplete. Foundation staff and consultants are encouraged to submit any suspected evidence of historical containment activity to the office of Dr. Kay.

A significant lapse in containment activities is noted between 1880–1939.

Personnel debriefings suggest Special Containment Procedures for SCP-7180 were in effect as early as July of 1920, but no written records exist to support this claim. Records prior to April 1957 are fragmentary, but suggest a limited understanding of containment principles.

+ Addendum 2: Exploration Log 7180-1

Dr. Jia, control team and D-Class dispatched to a commune in the Swiss alps to investigate an Unexplained Event, later identified as SCP-7180 Manifestation. A previous attempt at exploration resulted in total loss of field agents, control team and exploration logs.

Exploration conducted by:

 D-4041, D-5172, D-2300, D-1808, D-0991, D-1728, 04/14/1957

Additional Information:

 D-Class personnel will conduct the mission independently, with no real-time radio contact to base or one another. Audio will be recorded continuously from insertion through extraction.

[BEGIN LOG]

The helicopter can be heard in the background.

00:00 D-4041:

 D-4041, OK, signing on. I am exiting the vehicle at the insertion point. What? [INAUDIBLE] If I [INAUDIBLE] flare gun.

00:00 D-4041:

 Good to go.

00:02 D-4041:

 Heading north from the insertion point.

00:08 D-4041:

 OK here, there's a road consistent with the charts. Looks unmaintained.

00:09 D-4041:

 The signs don't make sense. I'll just keep following it.

00:09 D-4041:

 They're all blank, or [INAUDIBLE] dialect. I didn't think Esperanto *had* dialects.

00:11 D-4041:

 Yeah, it's not a dialect.

00:15 D-4041:

 Here we have a, uh, red octagonal sign. Doesn't say… Doesn't say "Halt" like the one we passed on the way in. It says… uh, well. These aren't quite letters.

00:23 D-4041:

 OK here, all the signs are just blank now I'm further in.

00:33 D-4041:

 Road is actually in fair condition, considering the locale. Lane lines are faded or gone, though. Like the paint was cheap.

Audible tape hiss grows steadily until 00:45 then subsides. D-4041 can be heard making a few remarks at 00:38 and 00:51, but is unintelligible.

01:08 D-4041:

 OK here, I've got a building. Small structure. Looks like…

01:09 D-4041:

 It's a roadside booth with a faded green flag and some signage. Mostly blank.

01:12 D-4041:

 I've got a workspace in the building. Lots of what might be brochures, documents, dictionaries… But all blank. Or just vague colors. There's a battery-operated radio, but it's dead.

01:13 D-4041:

 Whoever was here left their lunch half-eaten and their coat on the hook.

01:14 D-4041:

 Not much more to see here. Everything's erased or wasn't there in the first place. OK, moving on.

Tape hiss peaks at 01:37 and begins to subside. Inaudible remarks at 01:34.

02:02 D-4041:

 I've looked him over twice and there's no sign of injury. Fella looks like he was drunk — coat's half off, froze to death in the snow if I had to guess. But here? Ten steps from the front door?

02:05 D-4041:

 Wallet with blank cards… Blank money? Hot damn, why didn't you send me here sooner, Doc? I'm never…

02:05 D-4041:

 More around here. I… I'm not sure I need to look at them.

02:10 D-4041:

 OK here, this is getting to me. This stuff better not still be in the air.

At 02:12, Kay can be heard tearing cloth and swearing.

Additional Notes:

 D-4041 fired a signal flare and was located at the extraction point attending to a child affected by SCP-7180. All other personnel dispatched into the Manifestation Event Zone failed to return. At the request of Dr. Jia, D-4041 "Ostara Kay" was granted clemency for disregarding orders and re-assigned to SCP-7180 containment to serve as a test subject and assistant. The child was retained as a test subject.

+Addendum 3: Record of Containment Projects after 1957

Following the events of Exploration 7180-2, Antimemetics Division Initiative "Everything is OK" was proposed by Dr. Jia and Ostara Kay, with an emphasis on cost-effective containment.

Critical Grapheme deficiency in 1950–1962, responsible for the 1957 incident and suspected cause of other Unexplained Events during this time, was alleviated fully by 1971.

Proposals for new projects may be submitted to the office of Dr. Kay.

Experimental Rehabilitative Procedure 7180-Olympia

Final Report from Dr. X. Jia

April 14, 1985

- - - - - - - - - - - -

I prefer to let our work speak for itself.

— Xie Jia

- - - - - - - - - - - -

Members of the O5 Council —

I am Subject O. My caretakers call me "Olympia". After 25 years, I am learning to write.

I am disappointed in your choice to halt this project. However, I have the Foundation to thank for my sentience. Therefore, I have requested to report my experiences to you directly.

I was non-verbal for twelve years following the discovery of my body in the Alps by Ostara Kay. I'm only able to share my thoughts with you now thanks to the efforts of Ms. Kay, Dr. Jia, countless researchers, therapists, psychiatrists… and one very patient custodian.

I have the memories of a little girl named "Kupra". I remember the sound of her voice, her parents, and the things she liked to eat. I know everything about her. To this day, I understand Esperanto perfectly but can't speak it. I don't want to learn, OK? Whenever I hear it, I remember what she felt like as she died.

'' Sed kelkfoje ni devas memori. ''

(But sometimes we have to remember.)

My therapist told me about phantom limb syndrome. You reach for something, but there's no hand. You can still feel the hand that is not there. One day, Kupra's 

reach

 was not there. The spoon was on the table, but it was… impossible. And, in a matter of hours, everything else was too.

Forgetting how to 

speak

, how to 

move

, how to even 

take deep breath

… It was agony. Nobody knew how to help her. They were all going through it too, losing one piece at a time. She could see, she could know, but she couldn't 

remember

 how to do anything.

Before she forgot how to yell, she cried for her father. He wanted to help, wanted to see if she was OK, but had forgotten how to 

walk

. The man just collapsed on the floor. Somehow he could still 

reach

 — I remember his bloody elbows.

Kupra thought she could get away from whatever was doing it. All those people yelling. She decided to 

run

, and 

run

, until her legs wouldn't listen any more.

Kupra ended up… someplace warm. She got lucky, because the heat went out after that and it was April. She spent hours trying to 

move: left arm

 from under her, where she'd fallen on it. She could hear people around her, trying to do anything. Then she forgot how to 

watch

, how to 

listen

, how to 

focus

.

Finally, she forgot how to 

panic

 about any of it. That was the last piece left. She died.

Things calmed down after that.

Her body, the thing that was left over… It couldn't look, but it could see — like if you left a camera running. It couldn't think, but it remembered things, and it could put those together so they made sense.

It laid in the silence until there was nothing else to see, or hear, and it sensed something… Unfamiliar. It was the only intention left. It brought back memories of the adults in that place, before they all died… They would talk about the water and the electricity and the books and… getting old. They were always checking if the kids were OK.

Then you sent 

Mom

 Ms. Kay up there, and she found that body still breathing, and the SCP Foundation started to work on it and figured out how to give it new procedures. I remember the whole process… I watched as they programmed me like a computer. I listened as my mind began to think again. I felt this unbelievable joy when I learned how to move my hands, but I didn't know how to 

cry

 until much later.

All this time, I've been watching my life. But not just my milestones. I've been feeling for the thing that killed Kupra and her parents. For a long time, it wasn't there. Then, word came that you were shutting this project down. Everyone around here, everyone who has helped me come back to life. Miss Kay…

I saw them and I felt it again and I knew.

It was worry that killed Kupra and the others. Dread.

It breached containment.

It's a feeling you don't learn until you grow up. A sense that the worst thing imaginable is starting to happen. It gets into you and then it's always there, coiled against your throat like a ring of needles.

The adults all had it. I mean, everyone has it. But back on that mountain, they didn't feed it right. It got hungry, and then it woke up, and it broke out into the air.

Now that I can think, now that I 

contain

 worry, I am sure. Everyone in the Foundation is somewhere between worry and despair. Every time we say "I'm OK", "Are you OK?", "Everything will be OK"… we're checking on our worry, or somebody else's. Making little concessions to dread, acknowledging it: that's what it feeds on.

I wrote my first poem and 

Mom

 Ms. Kay says I should put it in here even though it isn't protocol.

| '' OK's the cure but it's the disease.

| We feed it, sure, but we put it at ease. ''

I'm not sure I can ever forgive you, but I believe in our Procedures. For the rest of my life, I'll be doing whatever I can to make sure we keep feeding SCP-7180.

— O. Kay (the younger)

Following the cessation of research into Procedure 7180-Olympia, Dr. Jia proposed disposal measures for Subject O: Assistant Ostara Kay assumed legal guardianship of Subject O "Olympia Kay" in June 1985 and has committed to keep a record of her home schooling.

+ Addendum 5: Incident 7180-17

Dr. Jia has been diagnosed with rapid-onset Alzheimer's disease after attending a symposium in May 1994. Investigation into a possible Manifestation Event or 

brain injury

 was inconclusive. By order of Antimemetics Division Director 

█████ ████

, Dr. Olympia Kay has been appointed as acting project lead until further notice.

Personnel traveling abroad are instructed to write "Everything will be OK" in a journal once every eight hours.

Footnotes
