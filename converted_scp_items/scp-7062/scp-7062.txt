Description:

 SCP-7062 is the collective designation for an anomaly relating to poet and former Foundation researcher Layla Becker. SCP-7062-A was an ink jar full of dried blood belonging to Dr. Becker. SCP-7062-B was Dr. Becker’s heart, functioning with no irregularities despite being completely disconnected from her body.

Discovery:

 SCP-7062 was discovered post-neutralization on 08/09/1998 when Dr. Becker was found expired on her desk. After a standard sweep of her apartment, SCP-7062-A and SCP-7062-B were discovered on a personal desk, alongside several poems written in blood. A coroner's report found that the heart had suffered rapid takotsubo cardiomyopathy

, resulting in the expiration of the researcher. Along with Dr. Becker’s corpse, a note in standard ink was found on the desk. A direct transcription can be found below.

Here I sit alone

Everything is cold and dark

Still waiting for you to phone

You were my spark

Now tears stream down my face

Your beauty reminded me of a dove

I see shadows in your place

Now I know the pain that comes with 

love
