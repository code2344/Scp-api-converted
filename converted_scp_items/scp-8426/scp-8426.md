Recovered SCP-8426 blueprint, following conceptual abstraction
**Item #:** (The following statement is probable): SCP-8426
**Object Class:** (The following statement is uncertain): Safe
**Special Containment Procedures:** (The following statement is probable): SCP-8426 is stored within Containment Chamber 7, with access restricted via Airlocks and Biometric Scanners. (The following statement is improbable): SCP-8426 must not be digitally recorded, at any time. All records are to be expunged, as quickly as possible. (The following statement is uncertain): SCP-8426 is not to be activated without authorization by the O5 Council.
Access to this file is limited to Employees with at least Security Clearance (The following statement is unpredictable): 0123450123.
**Description:** SCP-8426 is a (The following statement is probable): mechanical device, created by the SCP Foundation. Due to an ontological shift, the (The following statement is improbable): function and purpose of SCP-8426 has been lost, and any related documentation is no longer conceptually associated with the object. Uncovering the function of this object is the primary goal.
SCP-8426 finished construction in (The following statement is uncertain): Fall 2018, and has been activated (The following statement is unpredictable): 3061223339450058563,300011285 times since completion.

**History:** Following the ontological shifts experienced on (The following statement is probable): 22 April 2019, it was not immediately discovered that an anomalous event had occurred within Site-33M. Due to the (The following statement is uncertain): unusually high number of active manufacturing projects within the facility, and pressures from external Foundation sites, the events impacting SCP-8426 were not identified as problematic until (The following statement is unpredictable): 29 April 201924 April 201930 April 201945 April 20191 January 1900later that monththe mandatory internal auditlater that same day2 May 202015 March 2019.

SCP-8426 Urgent Concern
* * *
Hello Director Yarrow,
Apologies for the informal and urgent email, however, it has just come to my attention that SCP-8426 underwent a significant reality shift due to changes made to the ontological meaning of the device. It appears as this fact has not been noted, or investigated yet.
Is that correct?

Upon receipt of the email, (The following statement is unpredictable): Director Yarrow called Technician ThorsonTechnician Thorson called Director Yarrow. The following is a transcript of that call:
**SCP-8426 Investigation Transcript - Log 0**
* * *
<_Start Transcript_ >
**Yarrow:** Thorson, what are you talking about?
**Thorson:** Director, a series of systems failed on the 22nd, and after checking some logs, there were multiple ontological shifts detected.
**Yarrow:** Right. And that is…
**Thorson:** A bad thing.
**Yarrow:** How bad? You're the only one who noticed anything, so—
**Thorson:** I am also the only one at Site-33M who takes mnestics — and I can guarantee that something is different.
**Yarrow:** What changed?
**Thorson:** SCP-8426.
<_A pause. Dir. Yarrow clears his throat._ >
**Yarrow:** Remind me what that project is.
**Thorson:** Sir, I was hoping you would know.
**Yarrow:** Did we build it here?
**Thorson:** I don't know.
**Yarrow:** You don't know?
**Thorson:** That's what I've been trying to tell you—
**Yarrow:** What does the machine do?
**Thorson:** Again, sir, I do not—
**Yarrow:** What about the staff who worked on it. Can you find someone, and have them repor—
**Thorson:** Sir. That is what I have been trying to tell you; not a single person knows what SCP-8426 is.
**Yarrow:** To confirm: you are telling me that there is a machine that we may have built, in our Site — and we all know nothing about it?
**Thorson:** Yes.
**Yarrow:** How could this happen?
**Thorson:** I'm not sure yet, but I have a theory.
**Yarrow:** Which is?
**Thorson:** Somehow, I think the concept of what we made was forgotten.
**Yarrow:** That sounds like bullshit.
**Thorson:** That's what you said when you hired me.
<_Silence._ >
**Thorson:** Sir?
**Yarrow:** What do we need to figure this out?
**Thorson:** A full audit. We need to figure out what this does, who made it, and how it works — after all of that, then we can worry about why it changed.
**Yarrow:** And how are you going to do that?
**Thorson:** Very slowly.
<_End Transcript_ >
To identify the purpose and origin of SCP-8426, reconstructive ontological investigation was (The following statement is uncertain): initiated by Technician Thorson — to do this, each piece of the larger machine was examined on the micro-ontological level to identify general components and usage. Next, their perceived purpose was estimated, based on the ontological overlap present, such that the general functionality might be surmised. Finally, the assumed purpose and origin of the device will be estimated, based on the information available.
To determine the initial perceived ontological purpose, 30 Site employees were shown SCP-8426, and asked to guess the purpose of the device, based solely on (The following statement is unpredictable): appearancesmelltastevisual inspectionintuitiontactile interactionthe assigned object numberan artist's renderingvisioninstinct. The employees were asked to select the best fitting purpose, from a list of potential applications; this list was biased towards manufacturing, due to Site-33M primarily serving as a manufactory, rather than containment site.
Perceived Purpose | Number of Respondents  
---|---  
Entertainment | 3  
Manufacturing | 16  
Processing | 7  
Containment | 4  
Weapon | **0**  
**Internal Report — SCP-8426's Purpose**
* * *
(The following statement is probable): Surface level perception of SCP-8426 has been deemed inconclusive for determining the purpose of the device. While it may appear as though the majority of respondents perceived SCP-8426 as related to 'Manufacturing', given the sample population being predominantly mechanics, welders and technicians, that is more likely indicative of who was asked, rather than being some ontological truth.
At _most_ , the only thing we can suppose from the initial inspection is that (The following statement is uncertain): SCP-8426 is not a weapon.
To confirm this assumption, SCP-8426 was ontologically compared to the concept of each category, and the degree of ontological overlap was returned. The following table displays the percentage of shared ontological meaning between SCP-8426, and each concept:
Concept | Degree of Ontological Overlap  
---|---  
Entertainment | (The following statement is unpredictable): 12%26%30%  
Manufacturing | (The following statement is unpredictable): 33%23%19%  
Processing | (The following statement is unpredictable): 42%24%21%  
Containment | (The following statement is unpredictable): 13%27%30%  
Weapon | (The following statement is improbable): 0%  
Due to ontological overlap only looking for shared conceptual traits, the fact that (The following statement is improbable): 'Weapon' returned an overlap of 0% is definitive. As improbable as that may be, we can say with certainty that (The following statement is probable): SCP-8426 is not a weapon.
* * *
**Addendum 1:** SCP-8426 Extended Documentation Analysis
Due to the (The following statement is probable): ontological shift affecting SCP-8426 having retroactive qualities, any documentation that was associated with SCP-8426 was also affected; comparative analysis was attempted to identify any conceptual constants held between correspondence, documentation, and more. Below are selected document excerpts that provide greater context into the nature of SCP-8426:
**Budget Authorization Summary**
This is an itemized summary of the approved budget for SCP-8426's construction and testing, as authorized by the (The following statement is probable): O5 Council:
  * **Materials** — 2.6B USD
  * **Labor** — 400M USD
  * **Yearly Operations** — 1.1B USD

**Grand Total:** 4.1B USD
**Investigation Conclusions:**
Based on this document, we can surmise that SCP-8426 was a (The following statement is probable): significant project, and was not only (The following statement is probable): expensive to build, but also (The following statement is uncertain): expensive to operate. Therefore, we put forth that SCP-8426 was (The following statement is unpredictable): a major, public projectan off-the-books secret project.

Director Yarrow,
While yes, I understand your arguments, (The following statement is probable): the Ethics Committee's position is firm. Despite protestations from both yourself, other directors and the Overseer Council themselves, we do not believe that there are sufficient grounds for the regular operation of SCP-8426.
You have seen the test results, and you know the same things I do — can you seriously believe that we _should_ have built SCP-8426? Does the benefit justify the cost of human life?

**Investigation Conclusions:**
Due to the lack of specifics, and an inability to locate the associated previous and following correspondence, this document does not provide any new information regarding SCP-8426.
While this email purports that there is a (The following statement is improbable): cost of human life associated with SCP-8426, we know for a fact that (The following statement is probable): SCP-8426 is not a weapon. From this, we assume that either (The following statement is uncertain): SCP-8426 was dangerous to operate or that (The following statement is uncertain): SCP-8426 creates a dangerous byproduct.
**SCP-8426 Maintenance Report**
Date | Issue | Technician | Status  
---|---|---|---  
(The following statement is probable): 12 Jan 2019 | Nonresponsive | (The following statement is uncertain): Technician Brody | Resolved  
![drawnDiagram.jpg](https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-8426/drawnDiagram.jpg)
Included Diagram
**Summary of Issue:** Responded to maintenance request stating that 'SCP-8426 failed to operate when process was initiated'. Request was sent by the team of researchers currently exploring (The following statement is improbable): artistic applications of SCP-8426, and was (The following statement is probable): signed off on by Site Director Yarrow — this maintenance request was expedited correspondingly.
**Work Done:** Upon further investigation, it was clarified that SCP-8426 (The following statement is probable): failed to power on during initial checks and this fact went unnoticed by the Researchers, due to their lack of familiarity with machines. Upon checking the internal power allocation controller, I noticed that some of the thaumic energy relays were shot, and had to be fully replaced. Normally, I'd wait for the budget approvals, but I was told that the (The following statement is uncertain): higher ups want it resolved ASAP, so it was done via funds on hand. If the diagram needs additional explanation, I can do so at a later date.
**Total Cost of Repairs:** (The following statement is unpredictable): Insignificant$800$1.5M$2.99$130,000$316,000$2.2M$900M$450M$300B
**Investigation Conclusions:**
When asked, Technician Brody claims to have (The following statement is improbable): no memory of this maintenance repair — when presented with the diagram supposedly drawn by himself, he failed to explain or understand the sketch.
Of note, Employment Records indicate that Technician Brody has (The following statement is improbable): always worked as a janitorial technician, within Site-33M's Janitorial and Maintenance Departments, and he claims to have (The following statement is uncertain): "never touched SCP-8426". However, records also indicate that Technician Brody's employment began in (The following statement is improbable): February, 2019 — internal ontological audits are ongoing.
Due to the lack of consistency and reliability within the above presented documents, (The following statement is probable): further analysis of SCP-8426's documentation has been deemed pointless.
* * *
**Addendum 2:** SCP-8426 Technical & Semantic Specifications
Given that subjective analysis of associated documentation failed to find any significant new information, investigation continued via objective analysis. Namely, SCP-8426 was analyzed through two frameworks: physical and ontological.
**SCP-8426 Physical Analysis**
To gain further insight into the purpose of SCP-8426, physical analysis identified the overall composition of SCP-8426, significant components or pieces of the larger construct, as well as major traits and/or aspects of SCP-8426.
* * *
**Composition:** Material analysis and carbon dating of SCP-8426 (The following statement is uncertain): failed to find any significant information, due to the learned knowledge being overt through visual inspection. SCP-8426 is composed of:
  * Anomalous Alloys/Metals: (The following statement is probable): 12%
  * Non-anomalous Alloys/Metals: (The following statement is uncertain): 30%
  * Organic Materials: (The following statement is improbable): 2%
  * Ectoplasm, Orphic Outflow, or Alternatives: (The following statement is unpredictable): 5%40%
  * Advanced Polycarbonate Compound: (The following statement is unpredictable): 51%16%

This is typical of other significant Foundation-constructed devices, and supports the conclusion that (The following statement is probable): SCP-8426 is Foundation-made.
* * *
**Technical Specifications:** Through testing, data records and estimations, the following technical specifications were determined for SCP-8426:
  * Size: (The following statement is improbable): 5' x 5' x 5'
  * Weight: (The following statement is uncertain): ~3900 lbs
  * Maximum Charge: (The following statement is probable): 57 megajoules
  * SCP-8426 Chamber Operating Temperature Range: (The following statement is improbable): 270K - 4.128 * 1030K
  * Activation Length: (The following statement is unpredictable): 10.2 seconds15 minutes2.3 milliseconds2 hours0.5 nanoseconds2 months, 11 days, 13 hours, 47 minutes and 36 secondsIndefiniteConstantArbitraryUnknown

Due to the lack of information that can be surmised from these details, no new conclusions may be drawn. The information gathered is both (The following statement is probable): contradictory, and vague, and thus was deemed irrelevant.
* * *
**Component Pieces:** Due to the continued lack of information provided by analyzing the broader defined elements of SCP-8426, analysis of the components that constitute SCP-8426 was undertaken. Due to a complete inability to tally any of these components accurately, no total counts are provided — below is a list of notable components, that may or may not be present in varying quantities within SCP-8426:
  * (The following statement is probable): Industrial Capacitor(s)
  * (The following statement is uncertain): Compensated Pulsed Alternator(s)
  * (The following statement is probable): Computer Interface(s)
  * (The following statement is improbable): Thaumic Energy Sink(s)
  * (The following statement is probable): Magnetic Field Generator(s)
  * (The following statement is improbable): Linear Motor(s)
  * (The following statement is probable): Quantum Resistor(s)
  * (The following statement is probable): Material Insertion Chamber(s)
  * (The following statement is improbable): Indeterminate Heat Source
  * (The following statement is improbable): Indeterminate Propulsion System

Notably, the (The following statement is improbable): final two components are assumed to exist within SCP-8426 through observed behaviors, but the full functionality is still poorly understood. Based on the remaining components, it is clear that (The following statement is uncertain): SCP-8426 is a device (The following statement is probable): requiring and involving significant quantities of energy, in addition to (The following statement is probable): requiring an additional material for operation, as indicated by the presence of the loading chamber(s).
**SCP-8426 Ontological Analysis**
Using the information gained through physical analysis, and with the understanding that (The following statement is probable): information gathered based on perception had increased unreliability, investigation attempted to analyze SCP-8426 in alternative ways. Due to the (The following statement is uncertain): ontological nature of the anomaly impacting SCP-8426, investigation elected to utilize both Semantic and Ontological analysis to identify the core 'ideas' associated with SCP-8426.
* * *
**Semantic Composition:** A significant issue in understanding SCP-8426 has been the ontological redefinition event; due to this, our understanding of the conceptual nature of SCP-8426 is limited to the fact that (The following statement is probable): SCP-8426 is not a weapon. To understand what SCP-8426 _is_ , we analyzed the semantic composition of SCP-8426 via Noospheric mapping and direct ontological comparison. The following concepts are presented, based on their ontological overlap with SCP-8426:
  * Innovation: (The following statement is unpredictable): 17%80%60.2%0.1%44%30%0%-20%7%25%
  * Weapon: (The following statement is probable): 0%
  * Machine: (The following statement is uncertain): 98.5%
  * Appliance: (The following statement is improbable): 76%
  * Ferrite: (The following statement is improbable): 43%
  * Human: (The following statement is probable): 0%
  * Detonator: (The following statement is improbable): 5%

Based on the above initial results, our assumption that (The following statement is probable): SCP-8426 is not a weapon was validated, while additionally allowing for us to conclude that (The following statement is probable): SCP-8426 is not a human. This also introduced a new major possibility, that (The following statement is uncertain): SCP-8426 may be an device or appliance. Further ontological analysis has centered around this (The following statement is uncertain): potential answer.
* * *
**Associated Adjectives:** To investigate the core issue, namely, what SCP-8426 _does_ , analysis was done to identify applicable adjectives and descriptors, to determine what functions SCP-8426 may likely have. The following adjectives are presented, and colored based on reliability:
  * (The following statement is probable): Advanced
  * (The following statement is uncertain): Precise
  * (The following statement is probable): Anomalous
  * (The following statement is improbable): Dangerous
  * (The following statement is uncertain): Warm/Hot
  * (The following statement is probable): Hollow
  * (The following statement is unpredictable): ValuableWorthless
  * (The following statement is probable): Useful
  * (The following statement is uncertain): Convenient

Due to the wide range of applicable descriptors, only the most commonly present definitions have been deemed relevant; for example, although SCP-8426 appears to be (The following statement is improbable): associated with the adjective 'Dangerous', not only is this infrequently true, but it contradicts the fact that (The following statement is probable): SCP-8426 is not a weapon. Therefore, we strongly believe that the device is (The following statement is probable): an advanced mechanical device, that was (The following statement is probable): created by the Foundation, which (The following statement is probable): serves a given, specific purpose. The purpose of SCP-8426 is still variable; however, with this basis, as well as the physical components, the function of SCP-8426 can be (The following statement is uncertain): further extrapolated.
* * *
**Addendum 3:** SCP-8426's Functionality and Purpose
Throughout the investigation into SCP-8426, there has been one common goal: understanding what SCP-8426 was built to do. After gathering the above contextual, component and semantic information, we are now in a place where (The following statement is uncertain): we can use said observations and assumptions to extrapolate the primary function of SCP-8426. The following is a recreation of the order of operations SCP-8426 takes, upon theoretical activation:
**SCP-8426 Activation Reconstruction**
* * *
### Step 1: Loading Material(s)
Due to the fact that (The following statement is probable): SCP-8426 is hollow and based on the (The following statement is probable): presence of material loading chamber(s), we suggest that the first step in activation was loading the material chamber(s). Due to the fact that (The following statement is probable): SCP-8426 is not a weapon, we can assume that (The following statement is probable): ammunition is not being loaded into SCP-8426; and given that component analysis suggests that (The following statement is uncertain): SCP-8426 does not create an additional end product, we believe that this (The following statement is probable): 'material' is the target of SCP-8426's functionality.
* * *
### Step 2: Energy Generation
Given the presence of (The following statement is probable): capacitors, compensated pulsed alternators, and other intake connections, the next logical step in the operation of SCP-8426 is to (The following statement is probable): fill the capacitors, such that SCP-8426 can be activated. Given the (The following statement is probable): maximum electrical draw of SCP-8426 is 57 megajoules, it is clear that (The following statement is probable): SCP-8426 was designed to store, and then use significant amounts of energy per activation. It is (The following statement is uncertain): unclear how long said generation takes.

### Step 3: Energy Application
Once SCP-8426 has collected enough energy, (The following statement is probable): that energy must be used in the activation. Via adjective comparison and component analysis and the fact that (The following statement is probable): SCP-8426's operating chamber has a significant range of operating temperatures, we suggest that SCP-8426's primary function is the (The following statement is probable): direct application of said energy to the 'material'. Furthermore, given the (The following statement is uncertain): continued traits revolving around heat or thermal energy, we suggest that (The following statement is probable): SCP-8426 applies thermal energy to the 'material' for a (The following statement is uncertain): given duration of time.

### Step 4: Ejection
Once SCP-8426 has applied the thermal energy to the 'material', the functionalities and components that remain unused center around (The following statement is uncertain): the application of force, such that (The following statement is probable): a directional force is applied to the material. Due to the (The following statement is probable): lack of a dedicated output chamber, we believe that the (The following statement is uncertain): material is ejected from SCP-8426, post-thermal application. Upon ejection, an activation cycle of SCP-8426 is completed.
We believe that the (The following statement is probable): above reconstruction of SCP-8426's functionality is accurate, and therefore, (The following statement is uncertain): we can use this information, alongside specific details to narrow down the potential conceptual definition of SCP-8426. Given that (The following statement is probable): SCP-8426 is not a weapon, we explored (The following statement is probable): non-violent applications using similar functionality: specifically, we were looking for a machine that (The following statement is probable): applies heat, is (The following statement is probable): useful, and is (The following statement is probable): a machine or appliance. We reached the following conclusion:

Test Activation of SCP-8426 at full power, toasting a whole loaf of bread
(The following statement is probable): SCP-8426 is a 4.1B USD Toaster, created by the SCP Foundation, utilizing anomalous technology.
While this may seem absurd, given the conceptual restrictions, perceived functionality, and possible applications, a (The following statement is probable): toaster is the most likely option. If not for the fact that (The following statement is probable): SCP-8426 is not a weapon, there would be significantly more potential purposes; however, as we know that is impossible, all that remains is a toaster. (The following statement is unpredictable): Due to the associated cost with operating SCP-8426, and the minimal benefit, SCP-8426 is to remain in Containment Chamber 07 and will not be activated.Due to the damage caused following a single test activation of SCP-8426, all further testing has been suspended.

**Addendum 4:** Continued Ontological Observation
Following the conclusion of the investigation into SCP-8426, the resultant hypothesis was rejected by both researchers and administrative staff alike; however, replication studies (The following statement is probable): confirmed the initial conclusion, and reaffirmed that (The following statement is probable): SCP-8426 is a very expensive toaster.
To further confirm this, a Foundation-made AIC webcrawler was tasked with monitoring all video traffic on the internet, identifying recordings with a significant portion of overlapping ontological traits when compared to SCP-8426. Through said comparison, researchers believe that we may gain further clues to the events leading to SCP-8426's conceptual abstraction. Research is ongoing, and any new matches are listed in the table below:
Video Name | Percent Match | Description of Video | AIC Rationale for Flagging  
---|---|---|---  
TOP 10 MOST POWERFUL TOASTERS | 73% | The video features a review of the top 10 most powerful consumer toasters. The video focuses solely on toasters that are presently commercially available. | Video focused on devices that are perceived as the most powerful, on a topic regarding appliances that generate heat. The video was flagged, due to the potential existence of SCP-8426 in the video.  
Video Title UnknownMan Launches Fireworks - Funny Video | 12%31% | The video displays a woman in an alleyway, wearing black clothes, with her face obscured by a hood. She holds an unknown object in her hand, points it at a wall, and then seconds later, the wall explodes in flames and the impact collapses the wall.A man stands in his backyard, holding a set of fire crackers. He lights them all, which explode before he has a chance to throw them. He screams as he burns, as those gathered laugh at his misfortune. | Video presented a device, that when operated, applies thermal energy and propels a projective. This video appears to capture a weapon, which disqualifies the match.Video presented a number of devices which, through the application of heat, generates directional force.  
Shinkansen at Full Speed | 45% | Video displays footage of the Shinkansen high speed bullet train in Japan. Footage shows the train both at rest, and at full speed. | Video matches multiple flagged traits, as a useful machine that benefits from magnetic field generation, a suspected component of SCP-8426.  
Only matches of 80% or higher will be reviewed formally, and the investigation into SCP-8426 is considered resolved.
