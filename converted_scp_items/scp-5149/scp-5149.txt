Special Containment Procedures:

 Efforts to trace the source of SCP-5149 are ongoing.

Description:

 SCP-5149 is a radio signal of unknown origin being received by Lunar Site-34 every 24 hours. Attempts to locate the source of SCP-5149 have been inconclusive, though it has been ascertained that the signal is coming from outside the Solar System.

SCP-5149 consists of a short repeating message in UTF-8. The message is constructed of a series of forty-four dots laid out in a complex position pattern, interspersed with empty space in certain locations. Due to the extrasolar nature of SCP-5149's origin, this is believed to be an extraterrestrial communication or language system. At the moment, decryption of SCP-5149 is considered a Class-A priority; a team of cryptographers, linguists, and radio technicians are stationed at Lunar Site-34 for this purpose.

Not message at all? Maybe art? Compare for logical consistencies or repetitions of symbols to confirm if even language.

Translation Failed.

Connect the dots? Worth a try.

Translation Failed.

10.20.14

Greenhorn suggested we run it through nonverbal languages screener — poor guy thinks it'll really be that easy.

Translation Success!

Within .5 seconds of the scanning, screener had produced an English translation of SCP-5149. It was realized that no individual on the project had recognized the transmission as a form of Braille.
