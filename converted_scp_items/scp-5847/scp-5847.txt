SCP-5847.

Special Containment Procedures:

 The Rhodes Plaza Mall has been bought and repurposed into Site-86. A pair of guards are stationed at each entrance. No food is to be brought inside SCP-5847.

Description:

 SCP-5847 is the food court of the Rhodes Plaza Mall in Newcastle, Australia. It has two main anomalous effects.

The first is that whenever a subject consumes food inside SCP-5847, it will morph into SCP-5847-1, a courtroom. SCP-5847-1 is fully populated by SCP-5847-2, which are sapient, animate foods resembling their non-anomalous counterparts in appearance but with the ability to anomalously perceive, vocalize, and locomote

1

. It has been hypothesized from recordings that all SCP-5847-2 instances inside SCP-5847-1 are food the subject has eaten throughout their life.

Once inside SCP-5847-1, the subject is transformed into a near facsimile of their previous appearance, but composed of what appears to be a thick cake icing. They must then defend the fact they eat food to a large piece of sugar candy. The only two rulings observed, have been that the subject is not guilty and free to go wherein SCP-5847-1 morphs back into SCP-5847, or that the subject is guilty of "crimes against Humunchkind" and is sentenced to death wherein an Execucumber will consume the subject whole.

The secondary effect of SCP-5847 is a memetic effect affecting anyone inside the courtroom that causes them to unintentionally replace words they say with the names of foods.

Addendum 5847-1 Transcription of security camera footage from a trial held inside SCP-5847-1:

The following was recovered from a security camera set up in SCP-5847. For readability, the instances colloquial names have been used in place of SCP-5847-2

<Begin Log>

[SCP-5847 is seen morphing into SCP-5847-1.]

 

Bailoaff:

 Please baguette to your seat defondant.

 

Defondant:

 Why do you think you can boss me around ya big loaf?

 

Bailoaff:

 Heh, I'm the yeast of your worries.

 

[The Bailoaff smacks the defondant on his back]

 

Bailoaff:

 Soy I'll say it again, sit down.

 

Defondant:

 Fine, but stop doughing that, you're starching to get on my nerves. Wait, what?

 

[A Tomattorney sits down beside the defondant.]

 

Tomattorney:

 Don't worry about it. That just kind of happens here. You'll get couscoused to it.

 

Defondant:

 Who are you vanilla exctractly?

 

Tomattorney:

 Oh right! Nice to meat you, I've been assigned as your public defence arugalawyer.

 

Bailoaff:

 All rise for the honorable Fudge Hershey!

 

Fudge:

 Now, lettuce get this underwhey. Defondant, what is your name?

 

Defondant:

 I yam Josh.

 

Fudge:

 Josh, you stand before a jury of your pears, and by that I mean pears you've eaten throughout your life, to defend the fact you have killed and eaten so many of us before. Let's start with your opening arguments.

 

Defondant:

 I know this is hard to hear, but I promise I only ever ate any of you to stay achive!

 

[The Procharcuterie gets up from the plaintiff's table.]

 

Procharcuterie:

 Today I will convince you that Josh not only ate many of us, but ate us with delicious intent!

 

[The jury gasps]

 

Procharcuterie:

 I'd like to call a wheatness to the stand.

 

[An egg rolls up to the stand]

 

Procharcuterie:

 Hello Ms. Sunny Sydup. You all know Sunny as the Hard-Boiled cop who keeps our streets safe, but did you know Ms. Sydup was brutally attacked and eaten by Josh a while back when- well, omelet Sunny tell you about it.

 

Sunny:

 My memory of the event might be a little scrambled since it was pretty traumatic but I'll tell the story as well as I can remember. It was early in the morning when that deviled man kidnapped me and my fellow eggs. We could tell he was carton us off to his murder room

3

. Once we were there, we tried to hash things out with him but he wouldn't listen. Things started to heat up, literally, he threw us into a pan on top of some bread. That's when I knew, I was french toast!

 

Procharcuterie:

 As you can see, Josh didn't just use Ms. Sydup for sustenance. Josh, did you kale Sunny with the only intent being peanutrition, or did you do it to have a good meal?

 

Fudge:

 I'll ask you not to question the defondant at this thyme.

 

Tomattorney:

 I would now like to call a wheatness to the stand.

 

[A bean bounces to the stand]

 

Tomattorney:

 Now, Mr. Bean how was your experience with Josh?

 

Bean:

 Lima tell it to ya straight, there's nothing mean about Josh. I used to think he happily olived with the fact he kaled and ate us. It wasn't lentil he opened our can and poured us into a bowl that had so mushroom for all of us. I realized Josh cared about our well being too. Now I donut speak for everyone here, but I beleaf Josh is a good guy. He had bean consuming us solely for peanutritional value.

 

Tomattorney:

 Purely, for, peanutritional value. Now that doesn't sound like a man who revels in food's grain for his own turkish delight! Josh is a man who only eats us for his own survival. Do you need s'more convincing? There can'talope be any butter evidence than that!

 

Fudge:

 One bean's experience does not spleek for all foods. I rule in flavor of the peaple. The defondant is a man who revels in causing food grain and a perpetrator of crimes against Humunchkind. Call in the Execucumber!

 

Defondant:

 Crumb on man, I never realized you were all achive! I want to call for an appeel!

 

[The defondant starts to get up and try and run but the bailoaff stops him.]

 

Bailoaff:

 Hey! Romaine in your seat.

 

Tomattorney:

 This isn't fair! It hasn't been from the starch! Your Honor, what are you? That's right, fudge. You're way too biased to be a Fudge. You're spicefically crafted to be a treat for humans. It's not Josh's salt his societea has made it so ok to eat us. He should not be blamed for humanitea's shortcomings!

 

Fudge:

 This is spaghetting out of hand. I take my rulings berry cerealsly. You cumin my courtroom and flander my name like this? You're out of lime, bailoaff, escort him out.

 

[The bailoaff grabs the tomattorney and takes it through the back doors.]

 

Bailoaff:

 Have fun carrotting in prison.

 

Tomattorney:

 You cannut silence us! This is tyranny!

 

[The execucumber proceeds to consume the defondant. After the defondant has been eaten, the footage abruptly cuts to an empty SCP-5847.]
