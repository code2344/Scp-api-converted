APPENDIX [8939-001] - HISTORY

 

A rise in missing persons cases was noted in the area surrounding the abandoned Hawthorne Plaza shopping mall, in early- to late-2024; reports of unusual activity at night from civilians also appeared around that time.

Hawthorne Plaza, Hawthorne.

Further investigations showed that the mall had been the focal point of various urban legends and online rumors, primarly consisting of a ”dark entity 

[sic]

” residing within the structure.

The Foundation became aware of anomalous activity at the location after a recording of a search team was recovered, transcribed below.

You peeps ever heard of the Hawthorne Plaza, over there in California? Was built in 1974, got left to rot just over two decades later.

That place’s scary — in general, large, abandoned spaces like these creep me the fuck out; the Plaza is no exception. I can tell. I’ve been there.

Ever heard of strange happenings going on in the night? Of strange noises or weird marks left behind? Of people going missing, never to be found again? People have gone missing in Hawthorne for decades now; every large snough city has their strings of disappearances. But that city especially.

Because in that building lies something dark, strange, something utterly unknowable to the human mind, that lurks just outside of one’s periphery. Watching. Creeping. 

Hunting.

Like a poke into our reality, just peeking through an inch-opened window.

All that I’m sayimg is: 

Don’t go to that mall.

 It’s better if you didn’t.

Hawthorne, California -

 Three people were reported as missing on the night of the 24th of November two weeks ago, and now calls came into the police force of four more cases. ”These are devastating news […],” Chief Gary Tomatani says regarding these matters.

 

So far, no traces of any kind, except for the initial break-in in cases where the victim was seemingly abducted inside their homes, of the perpetrator(s) could be found anywhere.

 

Searches are currently being conducted by the police force. Residents living around the infamous Hawthorne Plaza have stated to have heard ”strange

APPENDIX [8939-003] - RECOVERED MATERIAL

 

DATE:

 12/15/2024

LOCATION:

 Hawthorne Plaza, Hawthorne, California, United States of America

FOREWORD:

 Footage captured by body-camera of a member of a search team, Officer Markus Millian.

[BEGIN RECORDING]

 

<Body-cam turns on. View is of the entrance of the shopping mall. Two figures surround Officer Millian; officers Florim Henderson and Sivan Groeten.>

<Another figure, identified as Julius Neng, enters the frame. They are accompanied by a dog.>

 

MILLIAN:

 Everything in order, guys?

HENDERSON:

 Yes.

GROETEN:

 All clear here.

 

<Camera pans to Neng.>

 

MILLIAN:

 How’s Christel?

 

<Neng pats the dog.>

 

NENG:

 Better than ever.

 

<Camera pans back to the entrance.>

 

MILLIAN:

 All right.

 

<They enter the structure. All of them turn their flashlights on.>

<The air is thick, with dust being riled up with every step they take, illuminated by their beams of light.>

<Groeten is heard to cough for an extended period of time. Their flashlight beam remains static, not advancing any further into the darkness.>

<The others turn back to look.>

 

MILLIAN:

 Everything fine, Groeten?

GROETEN:

 Yeah… it’s jus— 

(coughs)

 Fucking dust…

HENDERSON:

 This is an old place after all.

GROETEN:

 Yeah… kinda figured.

 

<They advance further into the structure. They pass run-down shops, trash and dried-up leaves littering the floor.>

 

HENDERSON:

 How many squatters you think lived here?

GROETEN:

 You mean still live here?

 

<Groeten’s flashlight beam rests on a sleeping bag and a few cans.>

 

MILLIAN:

 Focus. We could find something in here.

HENDERSON:

 

(to Groeten)

 You think one of the homeless did it? Kill those kid—

 

<There is a noticeable thud, followed by silence.>

 

HENDERSON:

 Yeah… sorry.

 

<Millian remains silent for quite a while.>

<Arriving at the atrium, light shines in from the outside, however dim.>

 

GROETEN:

 

(looks up)

 It’s getting dark…

HENDERSON:

 Damn. It’s been so long since I’ve been here, I almost forgot how big it was…

GROETEN:

 That’s how old you are?

HENDERSON:

 Shut u—

MILLIAN:

 Neng, is your dog smelling anything?

NENG:

 Sadly, Christel hasn’t yet. We’ll be on the lookout, though.

MILLIAN:

 

(sighs, mutters) Christ almighty…

 

<There is the loud clammering of a metal can falling to the floor. The noise comes from afar, echoing down the halls. The team immediately turns to look.>

<There is silence amongst the team for a few seconds.>

 

MILLIAN:

 Hello?

 

<No response.>

<After a while, Millian ventures deeper into the darkness. The other team members follow suit.>

<They pass broken-in shop windows and more trash littered on the floor.>

 

MILLIAN:

 You seen anything?

GROETEN:

 Nope.

HENDERSON:

 Nothing.

MILLIAN:

 Neng?

 

<Neng tries to calm his dog, which is visibly uncomfortable.>

 

NENG:

 Christel’s reacting to something, but I don’t know what.

MILLIAN:

 That must mean we’re close to something. 

(turns)

 Henderson, Groeten, you two take the left—

 

<There is a clattering noise coming from the distance, slowly nearing toward the team.>

<The shallow light that reaches into the edges of the hallways reveal the noise to be a rolling metal can.>

<Silence.>

<Noises of a struggle and muffled screams begin to be audible in the distance. Neng’s dog whimpers. Millian rushes down the hallway, followed by Groeten. Henderson does not move.>

 

MILLIAN:

 Get your fucking ass over here, Henderson! Let’s go!

 

<Henderson finally moves toward the others.>

 

GROETEN:

 

(to Millian)

 Who do you think it is?

 

<No response. Millian continues running.>

<They arrive at a dilapitated clothes store. Ragged clothes and dusty shelves line the walls and floor. The ceiling tiles are entirely missing in some areas, with thick black cables hanging loosely above.>

<Millian aims his flashlight around everywhere. Groeten and Henderson catch up to him.>

 

GROETEN:

 

(out of breath)

 Found… anything…?

MILLIAN:

 Help me search.

 

<The members search around the area.>

 

MILLIAN:

 Groeten, found something?

GROETEN:

 Nothing. Millia—

MILLIAN:

 Henderson?

HENDERSON:

 

(no response)

GROETEN:

 Mill—

MILLIAN:

 Henderson!

HENDERSON:

 … No. Nothing.

MILLIAN:

 

(mutters) Shit… fuck…

GROETEN:

 It’s getting late. Maybe we should—

MILLIAN:

 Don’t you dare start this with me.

GROETEN:

 —resume this tomorrow!

MILLIAN:

 

(shouts)

 You heard what I heard! We can’t just leave!

GROETEN:

 Markus, listen to me. We can’t continue the search in total dark. We come back tomorrow with more people. We could cover the whole area—

MILLIAN:

 

(approaches)

 You shut your mouth right now! We continue this search, no matter how late in the night it gets. And we’ll do it—

HENDERSON:

 Oh, my God…

MILLIAN:

 —until we’ve found these missing people-

 

<There is suddenly a loud scream. Millian turns around; the noise comes from Henderson.>

<Henderson quickly runs off without another word. Millian and Groeten look up; the black cables begin to twitch and slither around on the ceiling, like tendrils. A single large human-like eye stares down upon them.>

<Everything is completely silent, except for the heavy breathing of the men.>

<The eye closes, vanishing in the darkness.>

<The black tendrils suddenly shoot out at the two. They run away, but one of the tendrils is able to grab Groeten by the ankle. He subsequently hits the floor.>

<He screams.>

<Millian, at the exit of the store, returns, and holds onto Groeten’s arms. He attempts to pull him out of the mass of tendrils slowly enveloping him.>

<An enlarged upper jaw of a human, containing human teeth and bleeding gums, emerges from the shadows. It positions itself above Groeten, before clasping down on him.>

<Millian stumbles back; when he turns to look again, he is holding onto the bisected upper half of Officer Groeten. A trail of blood leads into the shadows, where the lower section of Groeten and the jaw have presumably gone to.>

<The face of a young boy emerges from the darkness, completely pale.

>

<Millian’s breathing becomes more exaggerated, shallow.>

 

8939:

 

(in young boy’s voice)

 Daddy?

 

<Millian immediately stands up and sprints away.>

 

8939:

 Daddy! Come back! 

Daddy!

 

<He continues running. He looks back; black arm-like appendages move toward him, elongating indefinitely. He sprints quicker now.>

<Millian treads familiar ground. Just as he is about to outrun the appendages, Millian trips and falls to the dusty floor. He looks back, the carcass of a dog visible on the edge of view.>

<Millian haphazardly pulls out his firearm and discharges a few rounds at the appendages; they retreat back into the darkness.>

<All of a sudden, footage becomes more and more distorted.>

<Thin, tall standing, jet-black, roughly humanoid figure enters view.>

 

8939:

 

(echoes) Pretty soon you’ll be pushing up daisies where the sun don’t shine!

5

 

<The entity remains standing motionlessly and staring at Millian. His breathing intensifies.>

<Millian aims his firearm at the figure; the firearm jams inexplicably.>

 

8939:

 

Pretty soon you’ll be pushing up daisies where the sun don’t shine…

 

<Unidentifiable black mass, roughly humanoid, lunges at Officer Millian.>

<Footage cuts out.>

The noises stop; there is this split second of silence, that split second that feels like an eternity. And then the tent is thrown off of the earthern ground, and there is a scream. Mel holds onto the ground for dear life, but whatever those tall, thin stalks had belonged to earlier is stronger than her.
