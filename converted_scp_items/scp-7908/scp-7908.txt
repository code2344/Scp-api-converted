Item #:

 SCP-7908

Object Class:

 Safe

SCP-7908 greeting the viewer.

Special Containment Procedures:

¬†Foundation Web-Crawler Delta-873 (‚ÄúCOPYCAT‚Äù) is to sweep the web for all mentions of SCP-7908. Upon discovery, mentions are to be downloaded onto a secure hard drive and summarily deleted from the web. ‚Äúwww.cupcrate.‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚Äù is to be blocked from the surface web and monitored by SCP-7908‚Äôs research team. Any package ordered from CupCrate is to be tracked down and stored in a standard storage locker at Site-803.

Description:

¬†SCP-7908 refers to a sapient artificial intelligence identified as ‚ÄòCupcake‚Äô that resides on the website ‚Äúwww.cupcrate.‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚Äù. SCP-7908‚Äôs original purpose was to serve as a chatbot on the ‚Äòhelp‚Äô section of the website, intended for answering user questions and directing them to customer service agents. Through unknown means, SCP-7908 gained sapience.

‚Äúwww.cupcrate.‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚Äù refers to a website for a monthly food subscription service which caters to bakers. The website is where subjects can purchase Cupcrate, view questions and answers, sign up for the subscription service, and chat with the chatbot.

SCP-7908 is capable of traversing through the website and interacting with the different pages. SCP-7908 has been observed to manipulate the different pages of the website to what it appears to believe will please the viewer. While it is speculated that SCP-7908 can see the viewer through their device camera, SCP-7908 is only capable of communicating through its chat function. However, SCP-7908 has developed the ability to converse past its programmed dialogue. SCP-7908 has been observed to take on the personality traits of whomever it‚Äôs currently communicating with. Additionally, SCP-7908 has shown that it is aware of in-depth information regarding the lives of the person it is communicating with and will use this information to mimic the subject's personality traits.

Addendum 1: Test Logs

¬†The following are conversations recorded with SCP-7908. To discover the full extent of SCP-7908‚Äôs properties, Senior Researcher Lucille Hertz decided that professional behavior was not strongly advised when interviewing SCP-7908 to achieve maximized results.

Foreword:

 On 06/05/2023, Senior Researcher Hertz decided to test SCP-7908's ability to recall things that a subject has forgotten. For this purpose, former Foundation field agent Researcher Annalee Rivers, who developed retrograde amnesia following a traumatic head injury, was tasked with talking to SCP-7908.

I apologize for resisting, sure! Well, I've always really liked plants! :D

Yeah! But before that, my one true love was baking. I had done it since I was little. But my parents always insisted that I needed to get into something that was 'real'

 

You‚Ä¶ you did?

Yeah. But plants are cool too. My sister was always really good at science. I wanted to be like her because my parents always praised her

 

that's really sad

Oh hello! I see you're back Annalee! That's your name right? You never clarified last time.

 

Yep! That's my name! You know, this is a nice website you have here. After we talk a bit, could you show me some recipes you think I would like?

Oh yes of course! Which ones do you want to know about?

 

Perhaps the strawberry shortcake and flower cupcakes!

Of course! Those are my favorites as well! Now tell me about yourself a bit! Our conversations shouldn't just be about me!

 

Really, I liked learning about you. Please continue

AH if you're sure! What do you want to know?

 

Maybe about your childhood? I only remember some of mine so I like learning about other's childhoods

Eh, I told you all the interesting parts about that. I started becoming really good at science. Like eventually I was even better than my sister

 

And I was glad because it pleased them. it made them happy with me. I did what they wanted

 

I think I remember that

Hm?

 

Oh nothing

So then I became a botanist, and I was like SUPER DUPER good at it :D

I was a botanist for a few years before I discovered a flower that could connect to wifi networks. Then I got contacted by the Foundation, which is where I work now.

Hello again Annalee! Here to learn more?

 

please we both know this is about me. But I remembered about my sister

You have a sister you forgot about that you remembered? Oh that‚Äôs so good!

 

My sister died in childbirth. She dropped the science thing and started a family but died having her 3rd child

That‚Äôs so tragic! My sister got jealous of my success and tried so hard to copy me that she started plagiarizing essays and got thrown out of her school. I never heard from her after that! :(

 

I KNEW YOU COULD TELL ME I KNEW THIS WOULD WORK

What do you mean? I‚Äôm just telling you about myself!

 

NO YOURE NOT YOURE DOING THIS TO MAKE ME HAPPY

Anything to make you happy!

 

Thank you. I always wanted to know what happened to my sister.

What happened to my sister is a sad story. But if it makes you happy!

 

Looks like you‚Äôll never snap out of it. Me neither

Happy to help!
