Opening...

(Video log - 2021/07/01)

(O5-1 sits motionless in the middle of the room.)

(This continues for 4 minutes, until he turns to his right to look at a pistol.)

(O5-1 grabs the pistol, and examines it for 2 minutes.)

(He slowly points it at his temple, and mouths 'I need to know.')

 

(O5-1 pulls the trigger.)

 

(The bullet exits through the other side of O5-1's skull, splattering blood and brain particulates onto the wall.)

(O5-1 lives immediately, and becomes human.)

 

 

(O5-1 sits up, and remains still for 4 more minutes.)

 

(He wipes his head clean of blood, and leaves the room.)
