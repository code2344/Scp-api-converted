Description:

 SCP-7845 designates a collection of disparate evidence that points towards an event of a counterconceptual nature that occurred to Counterconceptual Division Researcher Anabelle Chen throughout the October of 2023. All the objects are affected by varying degrees of counterconceptual contamination. However, this is believed to be a result of the event itself, not the objects.

The deletion of all dating apps from Researcher Chen’s personal cell phone;

Three stuffed animals within Researcher Chen’s flat that they did not remember purchasing.;

Several makeup products within Researcher Chen’s bathroom that they do not use;

A large amount of roses in Researcher Chen’s home;

Over 300 text messages sent between Researcher Chen and another individual. Due to counterconceptual contamination, these messages were unable to be recovered;

Addendum — Research Update

Two days after Researcher Chen submitted her initial report, the Department of Analytics flagged the file as containing key similarities to 

SCP-48592

, an anomaly submitted on the same day by Antimemetics Division Researcher Harriet Rosenberg. Following the ingestion of mnestics by both researchers, they arranged a dinner date at Samantha’s Cakes and Pies

 on November 5th to discuss the anomaly.
