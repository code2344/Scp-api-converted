**SPECIAL CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES:** Matter affected by SCP-8611 is not to be handled by biological subjects of value if possible. Destruction by incineration of any contaminated non-desirable matter is to be affected as a first priority. If contaminated material endures this measure then its removal to a non-essential β-class dimension is authorised.
SCP-8611 is highly transmissible through molecular contact. For this reason any experimentation is to avoid the use of complex polymeric materials or free-deforming fluids with potentially harmful isomers.
The spread of SCP-8611 has been determined to be slower through chemically non-reactive substances. Storage may therefore be effected in laboratories saturated by a medium of inert gas such as helium or neon to abate its transmission; with all unwanted testing matter disposed of as previously outlined.
* * *
**DESCRIPTION:** SCP-8611 is a reality-altering phenomenon which affects compounds on the chemical level. If exposed, a compound of significant complexity - with the potential to form divergent structural or stereo-isomers - will have its atomic arrangement and bonding transmuted into one of these other forms. This results in the gradual substitution of compounds and chemical structures into functionally different versions of themselves, often heavily impacting the reactions which they are able to undergo and the interactions between other parts of the same material. Each individual transmutation is random, meaning that many varying isomers of the same compound may be produced as a result of SCP-8611 exposure.
So far this effect has proved irreversible through non-anomalous means, with the chemistry of exposed substances being altered from the point of contact at a variable rate depending on their size and composition (see testing record). SCP-8611 appears to work fastest on biological material, subject size notwithstanding, and the profusion of metabolic reactions in living organisms which rely on specific isomers make SCP-8611 "infection" invariably fatal if anomalous countermeasures are not undertaken close to the time of exposure.
The only known instances of extant SCP-8611 affected material are three samples, formerly of haemoglobin protein, suspended at high pressure within a matrix of solid-frozen helium in the Reactive Matter Isolation (RMI) wing of Site 12.

**TESTING HISTORY:** On acquisition, experimentation to establish SCP-8611's nature began immediately. Once its destructive effect on biological matter was understood, research into applications in organic threat-nullification was conducted.

Test 8611-1  
---  
**Test Subject:** 25 cm-3 of laboratory propan-1-ol.  
**Timeline of Observable Results:** | **_Notes:_**  
48 seconds PE (Post-Exposure): | No visual changes observed, but a significantly more pungent alcohol smell had pervaded test chamber. | _Confirmed as the point at which all propan-1-ol had been transmuted into propan-2-ol._  
**1 minute PE:** | **Test Concluded** | **SCP-8611 effect established after spectral analysis of product.**  
  
  
Test 8611-2  
---  
**Test Subject:** 25 cm-3 of propan-2-ol from test 8611-1.  
**Timeline of Observable Results:** | **_Notes:_**  
42 seconds PE: | Similarly, nothing was observed visually. But the smell of alcohol had diminished massively. | _Confirmed as the point at which all propan-2-ol had been transmuted into propan-1-ol._  
**1 minute PE:** | **Test Concluded** | **SCP-8611 effect determined to be reversible by SCP-8611 itself. It is noted that the longer chain propan-1-ol molecule took six seconds longer to fully transmute than the shorter propan-2-ol.**  
  
  
Test 8611-3  
---  
**Test Subject:** One 200 mg tablet of Ibuprofen, a General Sales List[1](javascript:;) non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, consisting of a racemic mixture of left(S) and right(R) isomers.  
**Timeline of Observable Results:** | **_Notes:_**  
11 seconds PE: | Surface of capsule begins to crack apart. | _Speculated to be SCP-8611 breaking the bonds between ibuprofen molecules._  
54 seconds PE: | Entire capsule mass has dissolved into loose white powder | —  
1 minute 2 seconds PE: | The lumps of white powder start to conglomerate. | _Speculated to be SCP-8611 re-forming the bonds between ibuprofen molecules._  
1 minute 47 seconds PE: | Two pill-shaped forms have been constituted from the powder, reminiscent of the initial subject, but each half as small. | _Measurements confirm them as exactly 100 mg each, an anomalously precise degree of separation. Research into SCP-8611 as a means to convert optical isomers on an industrial scale proposed.[2](javascript:;)_  
2 minutes 40 seconds PE: | No further changes observed. | —  
**3 minutes PE:** | **Test Concluded** | **The two white masses were confirmed to consist of either enantiomer of the chiral ibuprofen molecule.**  
  
  
Test 8611-4  
---  
**Test Subject:** A slice of beetroot (_Beta vulgaris_) ~1 cm in diameter and ~4 cm in length.  
**Timeline of Observable Results:** | **_Notes:_**  
7 seconds PE: | Beetroot skin begins rippling from point of contact across subject. | _Theorised to be the re-arranging of monomers within structural polysaccharides such as cellulose._  
25 seconds PE: | Skin begins to lose cohesion and slough off of subject. | _Suggested as the point at which structural polysaccharides in the epidermal layer fail and unwind completely._  
39 seconds PE: | All affected plant tissue begins to progress through similar degradation. | —  
55 seconds PE: | Most of subject's mass has been reduced to a dark-purple pulp, except from a network of narrow filaments distinct in the slurry. | _Some of the filaments were removed and were found to consist of vascular xylem tissue. It is noted that xylem cells are lignified, a process which induces apoptosis.[3](javascript:;)_  
1 minute 14 seconds PE: | Xylem similarly breaks down. No changes observed after this point. | —  
**1 minute 44 seconds PE:** | **Test Concluded** | **The persistence of the xylem tissue suggests that SCP-8611's effect acts more gradually on non-living matter.**  
  
  
Test 8611-5  
---  
**Test Subject:** A 2x2x2 cm3 cube of pure titanium metal.  
**Timeline of Observable Results:** | **_Notes:_**  
8 hours PE: | No changes observed. | —  
**8 hours PE:** | **Test Concluded** | **SCP-8611 does not seem to have any impact on simple monoatomic materials. Or its impact is so slow on them as to be negligible.**

Test 8611-6  
---  
**Test Subject:** Laboratory Rabbit. "Daisy", a black-coloured Dutch. 19 months old, weighing 2.25 kg.  
**Timeline of Observable Results:** | **_Notes:_**  
11 seconds PE: | Point of contact on bunny's left hind leg begins to blacken and "bubble." | _Subject displays agitation, leaving its prior "sploot" position[4](javascript:;) and beginning to pace the testing chamber._  
1 minute 58 seconds PE: | "Bubbling" and blackening has spread across approximately 60% of the subject's body. In the parts longest affected, the fur is seen peeling back to reveal muscle filaments. | _Subject bounds around chamber constantly, smacking into the walls with increasing frequency. Its ears are reared and it is squealing intensely._  
3 minutes 12 seconds PE: | The bunny is now entirely enveloped in pulsating darkened flesh. The vitreous fluid of the eyes appears to "leak" out of the subject's orbits. | _This is theorised to be the implosion of skin cells following the forced isomerisation of chiral amino acids within protein chains in the subject's cell membranes. As well as the loosening of collagen stabilising the vitreous membrane._  
4 minutes 22 seconds PE: | All darkened flesh has given way to exposed muscle fibres, which seem to be unspooling from tendons and ligaments. | _The rabbit now lies in a prone position on the floor of the chamber, kicking occasionally. It appears to still be attempting to breath despite the obfuscation of its mouth._  
7 minutes 40 seconds PE: | The extremities of the rabbit (ears, legs, tail) have crumbled and collapsed. Organ and muscle tissue seems to be congealing in a pink "soapy" texture above the skeleton. | _Theorised to be the point of failure of the cartilaginous joints._  
13 minutes PE: | The conversion of the fur, skin, muscle and outer tissues into a homogenous pink biomass has almost concluded. | _The rabbit is still shaking, with the isomerised flesh approximating the prior position of its legs vibrating considerably; implying the persistence of nerve connections._  
15 minutes 10 seconds PE: | The sides of the biomass begin seeping a pale brown bile. | _Theorised to be the point at which the connective structures of the stomach lining were overcome by SCP-8611._  
22 minutes 50 seconds PE: | Subject has fully lost any semblance to its original shape. | _After writhing into a corner, no further coherent movement was observed. Postulated to be the point of subject death, likely through the transmutation of fatty acids and proteins in the brain._  
30 minutes 3 seconds PE: | Undulating of flesh continues. A layer of warm plasma has pooled underneath the remains of the subject. Teeth can be seen floating above the approximate prior location of the subject's head. | _Testing of the plasmic liquid found a high concentration of sodium ions, suggesting the complete dissolution of the subject's skeletal system._  
34 minutes 46 seconds PE: | All distinct anatomical structures have become unrecognisable. | —  
36 minutes PE: | No further changes observed. | —  
**37 minutes PE:** | **Test Concluded** | **SCP-8611's heavily detrimental effect on all forms of biological matter established. Test was repeated under various conditions to identify the optimal conditions for efficient action.**  
  
  
Test 8611-7  
---  
**Test Subject:** ███████  
**Timeline of Observable Results:** | **_Notes:_**  
1 second PE: | [REDACTED] | _Elements of MTFs Nu-7, Eta-5 and Sigma-9 are mobilised. Re-containment affected quickly, with only fatalities being the overseeing doctor and three lab technicians. Damage to original test container irreparable._  
**█████ PE:** | **Test Terminated** | **Contact with anomalously durable organic lifeforms prohibited.**  
  
  
Test 8611-8  
---  
**Test Subject:** D-6043. "Máire Fitzsimmon", a non-anomalous female human. 29 years old, in good physical condition.  
**Timeline of Observable Results:** | **Transcribed Speech:** | **_Notes:_**  
1 minute 12 seconds UE (Until Exposure): | Subject is introduced into test chamber. | **Dr ████:** D-6043 please take a seat. | _Subject sits._  
55 seconds UE: | Two technicians enter the chamber in protective isolation clothing. | **D-6043:** What's going on? Should I be wearing one of those? | —  
42 seconds UE: | Subject reacts violently as one technician extends a probe tipped with SCP-8611 affected plant matter toward her. | **D-6043:** Eh? What the fuck are you doing? You didn't tell me about this. | _Subject stands, backing into the corner of the testing chamber._  
19 seconds UE: | Dr ████ speaks over the intercom. | **Dr ████:** D-6043 please remain seated or we will be forced to sedate you. | _A small detachment of containment personnel are notified of the subject's recalcitrance. D-6043 looks panicked as the technicians again approach._  
3 seconds UE: | Subject begins to run for the chamber door, pushing the two technicians out of the way. Brushing the probe as she passes. | **D-6043:** Fuck! Off! | _Containment personnel are ordered into action._  
2 minutes 27 seconds PE: | Subject runs from the test chamber, passing through several corridors and touching her exposed shoulder to a number of metal-alloy doors and polymeric furnishings in the process. | D-6043 is heard panting heavily and swearing multiple times. | _Containment team splits up to attempt to cut D-6043 off._  
3 minutes 18 seconds PE: | Subject enters and hides in a supply closet, exposing various cleaning chemicals to SCP-8611's effect. | Dr ████ advises the containment team to avoid physical contact with D-6043. | _Two armed personnel converge on the closet, informed by the site's camera feed._  
4 minutes 7 seconds PE: | Both of the containment personnel reach the closet's location. One covers the approach with their firearm as the other advances. | D-6043 is heard coughing, spluttering, swearing and moaning intermittently from inside. | _By this point, a general staff evacuation had been ordered as SCP-8611's effect became noticeable across the subject's path of travel. Alert sirens activate._  
4 minutes 25 seconds PE: | D-6043 falls out of the storage room. The right half of her body and face are highly corroded and spuming. Skin hangs from areas of partially dissolved dermal tissue. | The agents order the subject to freeze, who only rasps weakly in response. A distinct hissing noise is heard from D-6043 and the closet behind her. | _The containment staff then step back from the subject, their attention being drawn to a multi-coloured emanation of light emerging from the open supply closet door._  
4 minutes 30 seconds PE: | A violent explosion occurs, originating from the room. D-6043, the site containment detail, Dr. ████, as well as several other research staff and D-class personnel are eliminated. | — | _Post-test analysis of the explosion area suggests the action of the volatile gaseous compounds chlorine azide (ClN 3), and fluorine perchlorate (ClFO4 ). The presence of these rare unstable chemicals is likely the result of SCP-8611 acting on a mixture of bleaches, ammoniated cleaning powders, and anti-rust agents containing hydrofluoric acid in the storage room._

**ACQUISITION:** SCP-8611 was first identified as a distinct phenomenon within what was later established to be a heavily affected young _Ovis aries_ (domestic sheep) specimen. It was seized from a laboratory located at ███████████ in London, England by members of MTF Beta-7. The premises were targeted by the Foundation due to their ownership by a corporation with ties to active Neo-Sarkic sects.[5](javascript:;) One individual occupied the laboratory at the time of SCP-8611's acquisition, who was subsequently sedated and removed for interrogation off-site.

**[BEGIN LOG]**
_Matlock enters the interrogation room and sits down at the table, opposite a now awakened 8611-Alpha._
**Matlock:** I'm glad you've finally come around. Would you like some water, or a cup of tea?
_8611-Alpha stares incredulously at Matlock._
**Matlock:** … coffee?
_Subject continues to stare as Matlock leaves, and returns several moments later with a paper cup; placing it in front of her._
**8611-Alpha:** Where am I? I … I want to leave.
_Subject starts from her chair and stares frantically at Matlock and the guards surrounding the room._
**Matlock:** It's okay Miss, they're just here for our protection. I'll ask them to leave.
_Matlock nods at the guard detail, who leave the room in single-file._
**Matlock:** It's just us now. No need to be afraid.
_Subject returns to her seat but still appears shaken._
**Matlock:** Now would you like to tell me your name?
_8611-Alpha is quiet again for several moments before she speaks._
**8611-Alpha:** Saira. Saira Fadhwari-Richwell. But why am I here?
**Matlock:** Well Saira, that was something I had hoped you could help me with.
**8611-Alpha:** What do you mean? I haven't done anything wrong. I haven't done anything.
**Matlock:** Of course not Saira. I'd just like to know what you were working on in the lab? Just now.
**8611-Alpha:** The lab?
**Matlock:** Right before you were here Saira.
_8611-Alpha rubs her head with her hand._
**8611-Alpha:** I'm not sure. Something … um … something my parents brought over, same as always.
**Matlock:** Same as always? How often would you say you work on things you'd consider … strange, Saira?
_8611-Alpha continues to breathe deeply and rub her temples._
**8611-Alpha:** I don't know, I guess whenever I'm home from Uni. Just things to look at over the term breaks. I don't do much with them, just write down what they do I swear. Why? Are they dangerous, are my parents in trouble? Please, what's going on? Are you the police?
_Subject's breathing increases rapidly again, she clenches her fists on the table._
**Matlock:** That's okay Saira, take your time and breathe. Yes we're with the Met,[7](javascript:;) special branch. But don't worry, you or your family aren't in any trouble.
_Matlock picks up a white folder and opens it, scanning for a few seconds._
**Matlock:** What do you study Saira?
**8611-Alpha:** I do uh … I study anatomical Chemistry. I was just back for the week.
**Matlock:** That must be tough. Do you enjoy it?
**8611-Alpha:** Y-yes. My family always wanted me to be a chemist, so I was very prepared.
**Matlock:** It must still be challenging, right? What kind of preparation did they give you Saira?
**8611-Alpha:** We've always been a very scientific family. We actually own that building, the um … the lab I was in.
_8611-Alpha clears her throat nervously before resuming._
**8611-Alpha:** Now that I think of it, most of the family deal with biology in some way. And they were always prodding me on since I was little. My cousin Ghani owns a sort of bio-tech firm, fancy exercise machines and stuff like that, that measure your heart rate and muscle growth. Um, Mum has her self-help books. They're all about improving your life through dieting and affirmations and stuff. Dad does— I mean he owns the company. They do all sorts of stuff in their labs. I think just being around them put me onto it, the apple and the tree right?
_Matlock nods._
**8611-Alpha:** When I finished my exams, they started bringing me the—
_Subject pauses. She breathes shakily and rubs her arms with her hands._
—weird things. Just to look at first, and I loved it. I was sick of mixing and measuring solutions all day. This was exciting. This was new. I just wanted them to know I liked it, and that I was good at it. So I asked them to let me test it all, only to mess about with. And … some of it didn't _behave_ right."
**Matlock:** How so?
**8611-Alpha:** Not like I was taught. There were diseases that spread so quickly, killing their hosts in seconds. There was a lab rat that was covered in tumours. So many tumours I was really surprised it was still alive. But it was. I think I named it Bumby and kept it for weeks. I'm sorry you didn't need to know that, sorry. Erm, I remember aunty Shannon left a sample here once. It looked like wine but it would turn anything that drank it sort of … inside out. They were all that kind of weird. But nothing actually dangerous if you left it alone.
**Matlock:** I understand Saira. What can you tell me about the one you had before you came here? Did your parents say where it came from, if they had more like it?
**8611-Alpha:** I can't. I … can't. I don't remember the last few hours. Did you … drug me?
**Matlock:** Focus Saira. Did your parents say anything about the biological material in the lab?
**8611-Alpha:** They said something, something about getting this one done quick. Before I left to go back to Uni. They sounded more urgent than usual. It was a sheep when I started, a cute little lamb. But it started to _unravel_ as I watched. Oh. I do remember. The way everything flipped the wrong way 'round. All the proteins, her eyes and ears and fur, her DNA even— oh god the way the muscle slowly slipped off of … of off …
_Subject gasps and then only breathes for several seconds._
**8611-Alpha:** She screamed and kicked the whole time.
_Subject begins to cry._
**8611-Alpha:** They said they needed her in … in bottles once it'd finished. That was strange. In thick glass ones, like they use for strong acids. Why? Why did they want that?
_She looks fearfully at Matlock._
**Matlock:** I'm not sure, but thank you for all your help Saira. You've done us a great service. The agents here will make sure you are returned home safely.
_Matlock leaves the table, pressing the small amnestic gas release controller in his hand as he exits the interrogation room._
**Matlock:** And good luck with your studies.
