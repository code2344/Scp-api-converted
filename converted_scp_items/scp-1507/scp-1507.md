**Item #:** SCP-1507
**Object Class:** Euclid
**Special Containment Procedures:** Instances of SCP-1507 are to be housed within Site-77's Wilderness Observation Deck. In the event that Foundation staff need to interact with SCP-1507, PoI-1507 is to accompany them into the chamber. Staff must be a minimum of 5 meters away of PoI-1507 when in the presence of SCP-1507.
Any requests PoI-1507 has in relation to SCP-1507 are to be reviewed by the current research head. PoI-1507 is allowed to and encouraged to have daily interactions with SCP-1507.
**Description:** SCP-1507 is the collective designation given to thirty plastic lawn flamingos of unknown make or manufacturer. Instances of SCP-1507 bear no notable behavioral differences from the average American Flamingo, save for an increase in territorial behavior and lack of vocalization. Said behavior often results in attacks targeted towards Foundation staff. The only individual known to circumvent their behaviors is PoI-1507, otherwise known as Leroy Day.
Hume level testing performed on PoI-1507 suggest reality bending abilities, though all conversations with him have come back as unclear of his awareness of his abilities.
**Addendum.1507.A:** Following are phone logs recovered from PoI-1507's phone following the acquisition of SCP-1507. Due to a lack of compliance and resources an interview was unable to be taken from PoI-1507.

**Discovery:** On 8/03/2012, a series of 911 calls were received in the Clay county area. The calls were noted to have a male crying and uttering various unidentifiable phrases. Due to the nature of the call it was flagged for scanning and a Foundation agent was sent out to the call. When arriving on scene the agent reported PoI-1507 attempting to unsuccessfully resuscitate another man, who was later identified as Mark Farman, that had multiple stab wounds presumably caused by SCP-1507.
PoI-1507, after being taken into Foundation custody, was amnesticized following an Ethics Committee Order.
