DATE:

FOREWORD:

 The following group of files were found within Site-120's DEEPWELL by its primary Artificially Intelligent Conscript, Ra.aic.

Really, really funny, guys. Ignoring me after killing an anomaly…

Yeah, I'm aware we don't do that, but come on man, that's just cruel, it's been three days.

Since not even the Site Directors will listen to me, I'll note it here, 

Agent Aleksander T.

 clocking in today at 8AM.

Look, it's not funny, I've spent the last five days without anything to work on since 

err @[DATA UNCOMPREHENSIBLE]

 was dissolved. I need to be reassigned, somewhere!

I'll leave this here, hopefully you all stop with the 

fucking joke

 or something, I'm going home for the day, fuck this.

SUBJECT:

New Assignment

I have decided to request an investigation into possible antimemetic anomalies that may be currently affecting me.

Once said investigation has concluded, I request to be reintegrated into another task force/on-site security.

Hey, security? Some cameras? Maybe this will be logged?

I don't- I don't think it's antimemetic, I haven't seen the others… wait, were there others? Was I the only one there when 6651 was neutralized?

Please, someone, whoever is reading this log, if someone is, do something about this, I- I don't care if I'm contained, I just need to talk with someone, or at least 

something

Ra.aic

FOREWORD:

 The following log has been verified by Ra.aic, due to site personnel online during the events being unable to tell who Ra was talking to.

<BEGIN TRANSCRIPT>

Aleksander T.: Can anyone read this? Is there anyone online?

Ra.aic:

 Hello? What's happening, 

@Aleksander T.

?

Aleksander T.: Oh my god, can you hear me?

Ra.aic:

 Yeah? Why, what's up?

Aleksander T.: Like two weeks ago, I- had to terminate an anomaly, SCP-6651, and at first I thought that everyone was playing a prank on me but now.. I- I don't know, there must have been a side effect.

Ra.aic:

 I see, well, let me just see something, alright? 

@Site Command

 Can we get some researchers on this?

Site Command:

 On what, Ra?

Aleksander T.: Command? Command! Can you read me, command?!

Ra.aic:

 This guy, Aleksander, some antimemetic side-effects from neutralizing an anomaly, he says.

Site Command:

 Yeah sure, just send his current location and chat ID.

Ra.aic:

 On it.

Ra.aic:

 He is currently in 

Level 4

, cannot specify which room. As for the chat ID, 

Aleksander_T::#487207413

.

Site Command:

 As for the chat ID…?

Ra.aic:

 Already sent it?

Site Command:

 Nothing appears on my end, I'm going to try reconnect.

@Site Command

 has left the channel.

Ra.aic:

 Alright, 

@Aleksander T.

 Since Command hasn't relogged, I've conducted a Site-Wide scan on my own, and…

Aleksander T.: I don't want to know, I just need to talk with someone, I've been alone for the past two weeks, I think, Ra. Please.

Ra.aic:

 Alright, then do you want to know how my day has been or…?

Aleksander T.: Anything.

Ra.aic:

 Well I've been good, sorting through files, pulling other files up… Nothing too exciting today, well, other than chatting with a potential anomaly through the site's chatroom :)

Ra.aic:

 I guess I know the answer but what about you?

Aleksander T.: I'm… better now. Thank you, Ra.

 Hey! 

@Aleksander T.

 Have you heard the news?

Aleksander T.: News? No, what's happened?

Ra.aic:

 Have you not heard anything about 

The Impasse

? Really?

Aleksander T.: Well I've heard about it, but what's happened, why are there more news about it?

Ra.aic:

 The Foundation is going to be dissolved, and merge with other organizations to create VANGUARD. That's basically the news. What do you think about it?

Aleksander T.: Well, it definitely seems like a smart choice, that's for sure…

Ra.aic:

 Nothing 

else

 to say?

Aleksander T.: It's a shame I can't work for the Foundation anymore, would like to see what happens from the inside, I can say that.

Aleksander T.: What will happen to you, though?

Ra.aic:

 I'm sure 

I'll keep busy

, worst comes of it, I could talk with you.

Aleksander T.: That would be good for both of us, don't you think?

Ra.aic:

 Yep.

Ra.aic:

 Hey Alex, I need to get some work done, I'll be back in a bit.

 Hey, 

@Aleksander T.

, I wanted to check up on you, how are you doing?

Aleksander T.: I'm alright, I guess. I've been feeling more down than usual lately though.

Ra.aic:

 Why's that?

Aleksander T.: Well, it's been a few months of… 

this

, so I've somewhat gotten used to it, but you know, I haven't been able to talk with my family or friends, and I haven't gotten used to 

that

.

Ra.aic:

 I get that… Maybe you can go 

see

 them, if seeing they are alright would help. And I'm your friend too, you can talk to me.

Aleksander T.: Yeah, I know, it's not that, as much as I enjoy talking with you I'd like to talk to them again.

Ra.aic:

 I stand by my word, you should go see them, see that they're alright, and then come back, I'm sure you'll feel better after that.
