[BEGIN LOG]
**Granite:** Mic check.
**Basalt:** Check.
**Pumice:** Check.
**Slate:** Check.
**Granite:** Alright, proceed.
_The team descends into SCP-6431._
_Houses with varying architecture span throughout SCP-6431. The space appears open. A sunrise is visible, giving SCP-6431 a red tint._
_Pieces of trash are scattered across the ground. Multiple roads fork off from the entry point, and pieces of furniture sit on the sidewalks._
**Pumice:** The fuck? Why's it so red in here?
**Slate:** I don't think we're inside.
_Slate gestures upwards._
**Basalt:** Weird-ass neighborhood.
**Slate:** No kidding. What's with the furniture everywhere?
**Basalt:** The furniture? What about the houses?
**Granite:** I mean, it's a space under New Orleans. Isn't that already weird?
**Pumice:** Why's that weird?
**Granite:** You really don't know?
**Pumice:** Oh, right, water…
_A slight breeze pushes a cup across the street._
**Granite:** Let's get going.
_The team proceeds along the left road for approximately 21 minutes. Various houses of no discernible pattern line both sides. The road branches after every 4-8 houses._
_The sound of a closing door is heard, causing Basalt, Pumice, and Slate to stop. Several vaguely humanoid figures briefly appear in the windows of the surrounding houses._
_Slate looks around._
**Slate:** Where'd that come from?
**Pumice:** I don't think we're alone.
**Basalt:** Let's investigate. What do you say, Granite?
**Basalt:** Granite?
**Pumice:** Shit, he's still moving.
_Basalt, Slate, and Pumice run to catch up with Granite._
**Basalt:** You good?
_A pause._
**Basalt:** Granite, are you alright?
**Granite:** Oh, yeah, I'm fine.
**Basalt:** And you'll tell us if something's wrong.
**Granite:** Mhm…
_The team continues walking for ten minutes. Granite turns on multiple roads before stopping. and turning around._
**Granite:** Hey, why do you guys keep following me?
**Pumice:** You're the team leader.
**Granite:** What're you talking about? Team?
**Pumice:** Y'know, the exploration?
**Granite:** Just- stay away. Stop following me.
**Slate:** You-
**Granite:** Go!
_Basalt looks around._
**Slate:** What do we do now?
**Basalt:** Let's go… right.
_The team, with the exception of Granite, turns to the right and continues walking._
**Slate:** We're not seriously gonna leave him, are we?
**Basalt:** No. We'll turn on the next block.
_The team takes the next turn and walks for six minutes._
_Basalt holds her head._
**Slate:** You okay?
**Basalt:** Yeah, just kinda dizzy…
**Slate:** Why don't we take a break?
**Basalt:** No, we're almost there.
**Slate:** You heard from Granite?
_Silence._
**Slate:** Basalt, did you hear from Granite?
**Pumice:** I don't think that's it.
**Slate:** No shit, Sherlock.
**Pumice:** No, I mean-
_An unidentified female voice cuts in._
**Female:** Where have you been? I told you to be back before dinner.
**Granite:** I was out with some friends.
**Slate:** The fuck?
**Female:** I was worried about you.
**Granite:** Sorry, Mom.
**Pumice:** Granite, you okay there?
**Female:** Come on, let's get you cleaned up.
**Pumice:** Granite, come in.
_Silence._
**Slate:** Granite?
**Pumice:** We lost him.
_A pause._
**Slate:** Basalt, where are you taking us?
_A pause._
**Slate:** Basalt, where are you going?
**Pumice:** Let's just follow her.
_The team continues walking for five minutes before Basalt stops and stares up at a house._
**Slate:** I… I don't like this.
_A vaguely humanoid figure briefly appears in a window before moving out of sight._
**Pumice:** Did you see that?
_Basalt begins to walk towards the house._
**Pumice:** Oh, no, you don't!
_Pumice forces Basalt to the ground._
**Pumice:** What's gotten into you?
**Basalt:** Who- who are you? What do you want?
**Pumice:** Basalt?
_Pumice's hands begin to sink through Basalt._
_Basalt stands up, leaving Pumice on the ground._
**Slate:** Oh god.
_Basalt tilts her head slightly before removing her headset._
_She opens the door and walks inside._
**Pumice:** Shit.
**Slate:** What now?
**Pumice:** Head back before it happens to us.
**Slate:** I… guess.
_Pumice turns._
**Slate:** They're gone, aren't they?
**Pumice:** Probably.
_Pumice and Slate walk silently for ten minutes._
**Pumice:** Hey, Slate?
**Slate:** Hm?
**Pumice:** What was your family like?
**Slate:** Why do you ask?
**Pumice:** I think… I understand now.
**Slate:** Understand what? What're you talking about?
**Pumice:** I just wanna know.
_A pause._
**Slate:** I didn't have one.
**Pumice:** Well, you're lucky, I guess.
**Slate:** Lucky? How is that lucky?
**Pumice:** You'll understand eventually.
**Pumice:** I think I'm gonna go home now.
**Slate:** You're not making any sense.
_Pumice turns to the left. Slate follows._
**Slate:** Pumice, where are you going? This isn't the right way.
**Pumice:** I told you: I'm going home.
_Slate grabs Pumice's wrist and attempts to pull him in the opposite direction. He continues walking, pulling Slate along slowly._
**Slate:** You're coming back with me. Come on!
**Pumice:** It'll be over soon.
**Slate:** Yeah, because we're going back up! Snap out of it already!
_Pumice's wrist passes through Slate's hands, causing her to stumble._
**Pumice:** You need to leave.
**Slate:** I'm not gonna lose you, too!
**Pumice:** You've already…
_Pumice stops and walks into a house. Slate follows him inside._
_The camera feed cuts out._
_Two unidentified voices begin to speak._
_Slate breathes heavily._
**Child A:** Nate! You're back!
**Pumice:** Hey, Syd.
**Slate:** Pumice, whatever that thing is…
**Child B:** Look, look, my tooth fell out!
**Pumice:** Don't forget to put that under your pillow.
**Slate:** Get- get away from it!
_Slate screams._
_The camera feed begins again, showing Slate running from the house. She continues running towards the entry point for 32 minutes._
