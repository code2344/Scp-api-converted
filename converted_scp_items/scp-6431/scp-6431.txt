[BEGIN LOG]

Granite:

 Mic check.

Basalt:

 Check.

Pumice:

 Check.

Slate:

 Check.

Granite:

 Alright, proceed.

The team descends into SCP-6431.

Houses with varying architecture span throughout SCP-6431. The space appears open. A sunrise is visible, giving SCP-6431 a red tint.

Pieces of trash are scattered across the ground. Multiple roads fork off from the entry point, and pieces of furniture sit on the sidewalks.

Pumice:

 The fuck? Why's it so red in here?

Slate:

 I don't think we're inside.

Slate gestures upwards.

Basalt:

 Weird-ass neighborhood.

Slate:

 No kidding. What's with the furniture everywhere?

Basalt:

 The furniture? What about the houses?

Granite:

 I mean, it's a space under New Orleans. Isn't that already weird?

Pumice:

 Why's that weird?

Granite:

 You really don't know?

Pumice:

 Oh, right, water…

A slight breeze pushes a cup across the street.

Granite:

 Let's get going.

The team proceeds along the left road for approximately 21 minutes. Various houses of no discernible pattern line both sides. The road branches after every 4-8 houses.

The sound of a closing door is heard, causing Basalt, Pumice, and Slate to stop. Several vaguely humanoid figures briefly appear in the windows of the surrounding houses.

Slate looks around.

Slate:

 Where'd that come from?

Pumice:

 I don't think we're alone.

Basalt:

 Let's investigate. What do you say, Granite?

Basalt:

 Granite?

Pumice:

 Shit, he's still moving.

Basalt, Slate, and Pumice run to catch up with Granite.

Basalt:

 You good?

A pause.

Basalt:

 Granite, are you alright?

Granite:

 Oh, yeah, I'm fine.

Basalt:

 And you'll tell us if something's wrong.

Granite:

 Mhm…

The team continues walking for ten minutes. Granite turns on multiple roads before stopping. and turning around.

Granite:

 Hey, why do you guys keep following me?

Pumice:

 You're the team leader.

Granite:

 What're you talking about? Team?

Pumice:

 Y'know, the exploration?

Granite:

 Just- stay away. Stop following me.

Slate:

 You-

Granite:

 Go!

Basalt looks around.

Slate:

 What do we do now?

Basalt:

 Let's go… right.

The team, with the exception of Granite, turns to the right and continues walking.

Slate:

 We're not seriously gonna leave him, are we?

Basalt:

 No. We'll turn on the next block.

The team takes the next turn and walks for six minutes.

Basalt holds her head.

Slate:

 You okay?

Basalt:

 Yeah, just kinda dizzy…

Slate:

 Why don't we take a break?

Basalt:

 No, we're almost there.

Slate:

 You heard from Granite?

Silence.

Slate:

 Basalt, did you hear from Granite?

Pumice:

 I don't think that's it.

Slate:

 No shit, Sherlock.

Pumice:

 No, I mean-

An unidentified female voice cuts in.

Female:

 Where have you been? I told you to be back before dinner.

Granite:

 I was out with some friends.

Slate:

 The fuck?

Female:

 I was worried about you.

Granite:

 Sorry, Mom.

Pumice:

 Granite, you okay there?

Female:

 Come on, let's get you cleaned up.

Pumice:

 Granite, come in.

Silence.

Slate:

 Granite?

Pumice:

 We lost him.

A pause.

Slate:

 Basalt, where are you taking us?

A pause.

Slate:

 Basalt, where are you going?

Pumice:

 Let's just follow her.

The team continues walking for five minutes before Basalt stops and stares up at a house.

Slate:

 I… I don't like this.

A vaguely humanoid figure briefly appears in a window before moving out of sight.

Pumice:

 Did you see that?

Basalt begins to walk towards the house.

Pumice:

 Oh, no, you don't!

Pumice forces Basalt to the ground.

Pumice:

 What's gotten into you?

Basalt:

 Who- who are you? What do you want?

Pumice:

 Basalt?

Pumice's hands begin to sink through Basalt.

Basalt stands up, leaving Pumice on the ground.

Slate:

 Oh god.

Basalt tilts her head slightly before removing her headset.

She opens the door and walks inside.

Pumice:

 Shit.

Slate:

 What now?

Pumice:

 Head back before it happens to us.

Slate:

 I… guess.

Pumice turns.

Slate:

 They're gone, aren't they?

Pumice:

 Probably.

Pumice and Slate walk silently for ten minutes.

Pumice:

 Hey, Slate?

Slate:

 Hm?

Pumice:

 What was your family like?

Slate:

 Why do you ask?

Pumice:

 I think… I understand now.

Slate:

 Understand what? What're you talking about?

Pumice:

 I just wanna know.

A pause.

Slate:

 I didn't have one.

Pumice:

 Well, you're lucky, I guess.

Slate:

 Lucky? How is that lucky?

Pumice:

 You'll understand eventually.

Pumice:

 I think I'm gonna go home now.

Slate:

 You're not making any sense.

Pumice turns to the left. Slate follows.

Slate:

 Pumice, where are you going? This isn't the right way.

Pumice:

 I told you: I'm going home.

Slate grabs Pumice's wrist and attempts to pull him in the opposite direction. He continues walking, pulling Slate along slowly.

Slate:

 You're coming back with me. Come on!

Pumice:

 It'll be over soon.

Slate:

 Yeah, because we're going back up! Snap out of it already!

Pumice's wrist passes through Slate's hands, causing her to stumble.

Pumice:

 You need to leave.

Slate:

 I'm not gonna lose you, too!

Pumice:

 You've already…

Pumice stops and walks into a house. Slate follows him inside.

The camera feed cuts out.

Two unidentified voices begin to speak.

Slate breathes heavily.

Child A:

 Nate! You're back!

Pumice:

 Hey, Syd.

Slate:

 Pumice, whatever that thing is…

Child B:

 Look, look, my tooth fell out!

Pumice:

 Don't forget to put that under your pillow.

Slate:

 Get- get away from it!

Slate screams.

The camera feed begins again, showing Slate running from the house. She continues running towards the entry point for 32 minutes.
