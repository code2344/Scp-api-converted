ITEM #:

 SCP-6077

OBJECT CLASS:

 Explained

SPECIAL CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES:

 Any additional instances of SCP-6077 are to be expunged from the public record. Failure to do so will require a misinformation campaign under the guise of a mundane radio anomaly.

DESCRIPTION:

 SCP-6077 are a series of identical transmissions, received via a previously undiscovered tachyon-based method from at least several dozen star systems of origin. The first instance of SCP-6077 was received on 15/08/1977, and was dubbed the "Wow! Signal" due to the exclamation the presiding astronomer, Jerry R. Ehman, transcribed on the printout.

SCP-6077 was the focus of a major Foundation initiative from the years of 1978 to 2022, as additional copies of the transmission were received and a more clear version could be interpolated. Following extensive research and effort by Foundation astronomers, cryptographers, and linguists, SCP-6077 were confirmed to be collectively transmitting the following message:

COORDINATED MESSAGE FROM THE UNITED WORLDS OF [untranslatable] AND [untranslatable]

 

OFFICIAL COMPLAINT OF DISTURBANCE

 

PLEASE CEASE EXCESSIVE PRIMITIVE TRANSMISSION

 

STRONGLY WORDED FLEET TO FOLLOW

As of 15/08/2027, no further related communications have been received, and SCP-6077 remain the only confirmed instances of communication between humanity and extraterrestrial life.
