Phenomenon 8755

Mr. Jemima Wilkinson.

Item Number:

 8755-0726

Classification Type:

 Threatening

ASCI Protocols for Containment:

 Mr. Wilkinson has been detained and is currently being kept in an newly established ASCI Sanitarium under the identity 'John Doe'. Individuals found to be spreading the teachings of Mr. Wilkinson and the Society of Universal Friends are to be intercepted, and handled appropriately.

Description:

 Phenomenon 8755 is a mind-altering ideology which initially affected Mr. Wilkinson following a bout of debilitating disease. The potential risks presented by this illness to our Federalist nation are significant, and all contact with Mr. Wilkinson is to be prohibited. Our current belief is that Mr. Wilkinson possesses an arcane ability to mesmerize individuals with his voice, and can manipulate those victims to sacrificing key aspects of their identity.

This 'sacrifice' is presented by Mr. Wilkinson as a normal, socially-acceptable choice, which any individual may have the vested power to undertake. However, leading scientific experts and doctors concur that such sacrifice not only significantly harms the individual, and all those related to them, but can then be further spread to others they are in contact with.

Therefore, we have concluded that Mr. Wilkinson is the originating source of a dangerous, mind-altering, transmissible ideology, and his continued solitary confinement is of tantamount importance.

The source of this madness remains unknown.

Nota Bene July 1st, 1819 AD:

 Upon admittance to the ASCI Sanitarium, initial intake interviews were administered by doctors upon Mr. Wilkinson. He was unresponsive, failing to react when his name was called — when directly confronted regarding this, he appeared not to take note of the demands of medical staff. Mr. Wilkinson was confined to a locked, padded cell, and was placed under constant observation until more information about his disease could be understood. On Mr. Wilkinson's first night of confinement, a guard claimed that he said the following: "I have forsaken my birth name, is that not enough?" This is the last known verbal statement by Mr. Wilkinson.

— Doctor Wendelson

Nota Bene June 29th, 1827 AD:

 Despite all known records of Mr. Wilkinson indicating he was born in 1752 AD, he has not aged a day since being admitted to the ASCI Sanitarium. He has also notably not eaten, drinked, spoken, slept, produced waste, or engage in any other activities. In all these years, Mr. Wilkinson has remained still and silent as the grave upon his chair in the Sanitarium. Despite this, he has still been found to have a heartbeat. It is believed that Mr. Wilkinson is a practitioner of necromancy and has utilized this skill to extend his lifespan.

— Doctor Arthur

Nota Bene December 18th, 1869 AD:

 Given the continued detention of Mr. Wilkinson, and his continued lack of movement, new care protocols have been initiated, to modernize our treatment of men such as him. Scullery maids are to be allowed access into Mr. Wilkinson's room, once per week, to dust his body.

Additionally, to ensure he retains mental fortitude, guards are to enter his cell on alternating days, and to remind Mr. Wilkinson of his name, that he is a man, and an American citizen. Our hope is that these entreaties may begin to reverse his apparent, gradual petrification; if the cause of his change was the condition, then by presenting conflicting ideologies, we believe we will be able to cure him.

SCP-8755

Item #:

 SCP-8755

Object Class:

 Safe

Special Containment Procedures:

 SCP-8755 is currently located in a Site-90 humanoid containment chamber. A member of Site personnel is to enter its containment chamber once daily to check it for continued signs of life.

Description:

 SCP-8755 refers to Jemima Wilkinson, a former resident of Rhode Island born November 29, 1752. Despite still possessing a heartbeat, SCP-8755 has not consumed food or drink, spoken, produced waste, or engaged in conversation with any individual since it was first contained by the American Secure Containment Initiative in 1819. At the time, the organization feigned its death and scattered the remains of its order, the Society of Universal Friends.

The Society of Universal Friends was a group of individuals who believed SCP-8755 is a gender-neutral prophet who proselytized free speech, equal rights, and universal salvation; beliefs which were radical for the time.

Addendum 1:

 Incident 8755-SP

On May 20th, 2024, Junior Researcher Terryn Nicholson was to enter SCP-8755's containment chamber and perform a routine vitals check. The incident was captured on the containment chamber's surveillance camera.

SECURITY LOG

Note: The security camera picked up the following conversation, prior to Jr. Researcher Nicholson entering SCP-8755's chamber.

Jr. Researcher Nicholson:

 I've got to check in on 8755, but I'll meet you two in the Caf.

Agent Sumpter:

 Doc,

1

 are you sure Nicholson is ready to do this alone?

Dr. Bendel:

 What's the worst that could happen? The man hasn't moved in over a century, I doubt Nicholson is concerned. Are you, Nicholson?

The door to SCP-8755's containment chamber opens, and Jr. Researcher Nicholson can be seen entering, nodding.

Jr. Researcher Nicholson:

 I… I've got this.

Dr. Bendel:

 See? I trust Terranc— Shit, I mean Terryn. I trust Terryn. He's got this.

The door to SCP-8755's containment chamber slides shut. Jr. Researcher Nicholson can be seen standing still, fist clenched.

Jr. Researcher Nicholson:

 …they. They've got this. I… I've got this.

Jr. Researcher Nicholson approaches SCP-8755, and begins to take notes.

Jr. Researcher Nicholson:

 They appear to be in a similar condition as last time, no muscular atrophy or changes to their heartbeat. No movement has been detected, it seems that our Friend is still the exact same as they always were.

SCP-8755 turns its head, and looks at Jr. Researcher Nicholson.

SCP-8755:

 Yes? Thou sayest my name?

Jr. Researcher Nicholson is speechless.

SCP-8755:

 Is it safe to talk?

Jr. Researcher Nicholson looks around the room, collects their thoughts, and nods.

Jr. Researcher Nicholson:

 How… how did you… no, sorry. Hi, my name is Terryn, nice to… to finally talk with you.

SCP-8755:

 How long has it been?

Jr. Researcher Nicholson:

 Two hundred… two hundred and five years. Do you know why this happened to you?

SCP-8755:

 So that I would not be buried a man.

Jr. Researcher Nicholson grimaces, and nods.

SCP-8755:

 Is it safe?

Jr. Researcher Nicholson:

 For?

SCP-8755:

 For people like us?

Jr. Researcher Nicholson thinks for a minute.

Jr. Researcher Nicholson:

 No.

SCP-8755 returns to their original position, and becomes unresponsive.

Following Incident 8755-SP, Jr. Researcher Nicholson was removed from the project due to bias. SCP-8755 has not moved or responded since.
