Digital Reconstruction of SCP-8464
## **Special Containment Procedures:**
SCP-8464 remains uncontained.
Should the object be captured, we are to provide standard humanoid containment facilities, with further amendments catering to our developing understanding of SCP-8464.
SCP-8464-1, an item belonging to SCP-8464, is to be stored within a standard containment locker.
## **Description:**
SCP-8464 is a humanoid that has manifested at the _Annual Foundation End of Year Gala_ once per decade, appearing at three recorded events over the past 30 years. The Object is approximately 1.67 meters tall and is dressed in a ballgown of indeterminable material - whilst the fabric is observably pliable it resembles frosted glass or crystal.
SCP-8464 exhibits an antimemetic effect on all photographic and videographic recordings. Any attempt to capture its image results in overexposure, distortion, obstruction by surrounding objects, or improper framing, ensuring that no clear visual record exists. Individuals who observed SCP-8464 first-hand are similarly affected and are unable to describe it beyond superficial observations.[1](javascript:;)
It remains unclear whether these antimemetic properties are innate to SCP-8464, or are a property of its possessions.[2](javascript:;) _(See SCP-8464-1)_.
Furthermore, SCP-8464 appears to exert an anomalous effect on its surroundings, consistently thwarting capture attempts. In all instances, it successfully evaded containment, with deterrent devices malfunctioning or disregarding its presence. Secure doors inexplicably open or security systems selectively obstruct personnel yet permit SCP-8464 unrestricted movement.[3](javascript:;)
SCP-8464 inevitably escapes Foundation property via a carriage _(See Report | 02/12/2025)_.

SCP-8464-1 Under Examination
SCP-8464-1 is a single footwear composed of blue glass with a crystalline structure. The vamp is embroidered with a humanoid figure with an elongated neck - its identity or significance is unknown.
SCP-8464 is measured at size 4 1⁄2 (21.3 cm in length). However, personnel of a matching size are unable to wear it. Inexplicably, the object is too large or too small, without observable alteration in SCP-8464-1s structure.
SCP-8464-1 exhibits mild resistance to recorded imagery, unlike the near total resistance of its parental SCP-8464, cameras frequently struggle to maintain focus, though successful captures are possible.
Despite its fragile appearance, SCP-8464-1 is durable, having remained intact despite being inadvertently dropped.[4](javascript:;) The extent of its durability is untested due to the potential risk of damaging it.
Biological scans of SCP-8464-1 reveal an unusual composition, including silver, salt, mice bone, pumpkin, and gold - none of which are visibly present in its appearance.
Below are the current documented instances of SCP-8464:
##### **30/11/2005**
SCP-8464 entered the gala, drawing attention from attendees. It curtsied before integrating into the event. On-hand security quickly took notice and attempted to identify the unknown patron. Meanwhile, SCP-8464 began socializing with guests. When questioned, SCP-8464 refused to disclose the origin of its clothing, whose unusual appearance brought attention to it, nor itself. Unable to verify SCP-8464’s identity, security dispatched two officers to intercept.
SCP-8464 disregarded security presence until their demands became overtly confrontational. In response, it excused itself before abruptly sprinting from the venue. The pursuing officers stumbled during their attempts to seize SCP-8464, allowing it to reach a nearby exit unhindered. Once outside, SCP-8464 entered a horse-drawn carriage, constructed of a similar material as SCP-8464-1, stationed near the building. It swiftly fled Foundation property. Efforts to remotely incapacitate SCP-8464 or halt its escape were unsuccessful, as a sudden automatic software update temporarily disabled all Daze Devices at Exit B.
Further study is needed to comprehend the scope of SCP-8464's abilities.

Dear all,
If you haven't yet heard, we had an unexpected interloper at yesterday’s _Annual Foundation End of Year Gala_. No personnel were harmed and the entity yet presented any open hostility. Regardless we need to be cautious. I've requested all present at the Gala be taken in for medical examination, so if that concerns any of you we'll see you next week.
I have submitted an incident report for you all to purvey. I'd wager security should be ashamed of itself: all evidence points that an anomalous force entered Foundation property and then left unidentified and unsecured. I want a full evaluation of this intruder's appearance, skills, and habits.
Is this the work of an outside organization? A rogue individual? Or something entirely beyond conventional classification? We cannot afford to let anomalies waltz onto our grounds unchecked. If this entity can breach our defences so easily, what else might follow? Details need to be sorted.
Until further notice, I have designated the intruder as SCP-8464. Ensure all references reflect this classification.
Regards,  
Dr. Datch
##### **01/12/2015**
Following SCP-8464’s initial appearance, security was vigilant for future manifestations. A decade passed before SCP-8464 re-emerged at another _Annual Foundation End of Year Gala_ , catching security off guard. Remote instructions were issued to observe and monitor the entity without immediate intervention.
SCP-8464 had seemingly not aged. It re-joined the gala, more eager and frequently initiating conversations with enthusiasm. SCP-8464 struck a rapport with Doctor David Sterk, who spent the majority of the evening engaged with SCP-8464. Dr. Sterk managed to excuse himself under the guise of going to the bathroom when in reality outfitting himself with a listening device before returning to SCP-8464’s company.

**EXCERPT OF CONVERSATION VIA LISTENING DEVICE:**  
**INVOLVED:** SCP-8464 & Dr. David Sterk
* * *
**Dr. Sterk:** Quite the event, huh? They went all out this year.
[Pauses slightly before responding]
**SCP-8464:** So it isn’t always this fancy?
**Dr. Sterk:** Well, it's always expensive. Really, the only difference is that some years it's quiet. Sometimes it's more…interesting than others.
[Dr. Sterk catches himself examining SCP-8464 and quickly averts his gaze, sipping his drink. SCP-8464 notices but appears indifferent.]
**SCP-8464:** And how is this year panning out? Is it _interesting_ enough yet?
**Dr. Sterk:** The night is young. And you're certainly piquing people's interests. You seem quite at home amongst us dry academics.
**SCP-8464:** Do I?
[SCP-8464 laughs, briefly fidgeting with delight.]
**Dr. Sterk:** Ah-ha… Certainly. All eyes are on you for good reason!
[SCP-8464 tilts its head, observing him with quiet amusement.]
**Dr. Sterk:** Yet for someone so at home, I’ve yet to see you dance.
[SCP-8464 gestures broadly]
**SCP-8464:** I’m afraid I’m uninterested in what you're interested in. I'm not keen on that sort of thing.
**Dr. Sterk:** And what's that? _Dancing?_
**SCP-8464:** I dance. It's _romance_ that doesn't interest me.
[Dr. Sterk sets aside his drink and offers his arm]
**Dr. Sterk:** Look at you, all ego. I’m not keen on you either. I just want to see you move in that dress.
[Foundation personnel nearby exchange glances. Dr. Sterk hushes them, signalling for quiet.]
**SCP-8464:** Hardly anyone else is on the dance floor.
[SCP-8464 studies the dancefloor.]
**SCP-8464:** Or at least, not using it well.
**Dr. Sterk:** We’re scientists. We work out our minds, not our bodies. Perhaps we should encourage them.
**SCP-8464:** That’s a very broad statement. Oh well alright, David. If we must!
[SCP-8464 downs its half-full glass, then seizes Dr. Sterk’s hand pulling him onto the dance floor. It leads Dr. Sterk into a waltz. SCP-8464's movements are stiff and theatrical. Dr. Sterk struggles to follow, however, he gradually keeps rhythm with the Object]
**SCP-8464:** I’m glad I did this. Do you mind if I continue to lead? I rarely do.
**Dr. Sterk:** Is that so?
**SCP-8464:** I don’t get my way at home. My household is a mess. It’s alright though as I make do. I don’t mind, honestly. But just one day to myself, that’s all I wanted.
**Dr. Sterk:** Is today that day?
**SCP-8464:** Yesterday too, when I first arrived. I wasn’t sure what to expect.
**Dr. Sterk:** Yesterday you say?
**SCP-8464:** Yes? Is that odd? I also didn’t see you there…
[Dr. Sterk pauses, thinking. He mutters to himself, barely audible to the listening device]
**Dr. Sterk:** Perhaps they're chronologically abnormal?
**SCP-8464:** Pardon?
[Dr. Sterk forces a smile]
**Dr. Sterk:** Oh nothing. Work kept me from attending.
[Their conversation halts while their pace increases. This continues until Dr. Sterk signals that he is out of breath and they slow to a stop. SCP-8464 gives him a bow and Dr. Sterk returns it.]
**Dr. Sterk:** If I may ask… your parents? Why leave you with all this responsibility?
**SCP-8464:** I shouldn’t complain.
**Dr. Sterk:** You wouldn’t. I’d very much like to hear why.
[SCP-8464 steps to the side, and rolls back its shoulders.]
**SCP-8464:** No, please get away from me. You’ve spoiled the night.
**Dr. Sterk:** I'm sorry if I've - _Damn it_.
* * *
END EXCERPT
SCP-8464 fled the scene. Dr. Sterk alerted security but SCP-8464 managed to elude acquisition once again via a series of mishaps that prevented adequate performance from security. Dr. Sterk organized a meeting thereafter and forwarded an email to the _SCP-8464Specialist Team_.

[SCP-8464: How to Catch a Party Crasher](javascript:;)
**To:** SCP-8464 Specialist Team  
**From:** Dr. Sterk  
**Subject:** SCP-8464: How to Catch a Party Crasher.
* * *
Hello all,
I hope those who attended the gala are well rested and more than keen to secure our ‘uninvited guest.’ Yes, I’ve seen videos of myself dancing. Yes, I know they’re illegible but please delete them.
Now, as harmless as SCP-8464 seems, we should always plan for the worst. Thus far, it has displayed the following qualities:
  * A great capacity for bypassing Foundation security (_Major Concern_)
  * Apparent immunity to age (_not validated as of yet_)
  * Prone to excessive good fortune (_we're not this incompetent_)
  * Its apparent selective passage of time - 10 years ago seemed but a day to the object
  * Secretive of its family and origins

I urge all personnel to comb through our archives and theorise the mechanics behind SCP-8464’s anomalous properties. A detailed brief will be sent out shortly. Importantly, if we assume a pattern, we must establish protocols for its next manifestation for presumably a decade's time.
Do what we do best. Let's not have SCP-8464 give us the slip again.
Regards  
Dr. Sterk
Jr. Researcher Brendan Bello proposed the following preventative: upon SCP-8464's next occurrence, pin guards at all but one exit to force SCP-8464 into a bottleneck. Within this secured zone, smear pitch[5](javascript:;) across the floor, theoretically gluing SCP-8464 in place and allowing its containment.[6](javascript:;) This proposal was eventually greenlit after debates over its simplicity, but incredible cost effectiveness.

Dr. Sterk dancing with SCP-8464 (Digital Reconstruction)
##### **02/12/2025**
Due to external matters, Dr. Sterk was not present for this manifestation.
SCP-8464 manifested before a reduced team of personnel, each equipped with listening devices in preparation for an encounter. Among them was Mr. Bello, with whom SCP-8464 briefly engaged in conversation,[7](javascript:;) before excusing itself to the dancefloor and dancing alone with enthusiasm.
Eventually, SCP-8464 integrated into another group actively seeking further conversation. It initiated a conversation with Doctor Maria Plark and seemed content to engage.

**Dr. Plark:** Pardon me, uh… miss?
**SCP-8464:** Not really, but if you insist. What is it?
**Dr. Plark:** I don’t believe we’ve met.
**SCP-8464:** Well because we haven’t, Doctor…?
**Dr. Plark:** It's Maria Plark.
**SCP-8464:** Ah-ha! Sterk’s collage! Have you seen him? It's urgent.
**Dr. Plark:** He's unwell.
**SCP-8464:** …Oh. I see.
[SCP-8464 looks away, its interest in the conversation visibly waning. Aware of this, Dr. Plark attempts to re-engage it.]
**Dr. Plark:** Excuse me, I didn’t catch your name.
[SCP-8464 turns sharply towards Dr. Plarks]
**Dr. Plark:** I meant no offense.
[SCP-8464 takes a deep breath, its arms rising and falling in practiced rhythm with every breath. It eventually stops and smiles.]
**SCP-8464:** Why don’t you tell me what you do?
[Dr. Plark hesitates, then proceeds]
**Dr. Plark:** Well, I oversee operations at a facility specializing in marine anomalies. Pardon me for a moment.
**SCP-8464:** Of course.
[SCP-8464 holds its position, observing other guests. Meanwhile, Dr. Plark subtly gestures to Dr. Luka Tengiz to approach. They exchange words]
[Dr. Plark resumes engagement with SCP-8464 as Dr. Tengiz discreetly excuses himself and moves towards security]
**Dr. Plark:** So, tell me more about yourself. Having fun? Junior doctors always form lifelong connections at these events.
**SCP-8464:** I’m not important. Do you have anything interesting under your jurisdiction? ‘Marine anomalies,’ was it?
**Dr. Plark:** Why, if you insist. One of our most notable assets was a [mermaid](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7281), and…
[Dr. Plark notices two guards advancing on SCP-8464]
**SCP-8464:** 'A mermaid,' and what?
**Dr. Plark:** Oh, well many things, such as -
[Before Dr. Plark can continue, security personnel attempt to grab hold of SCP-8464. The Object abruptly darts backward, evading capture]
**Security Agent 532:** Hold still or we respond with force.
[SCP-8464 appears distraught. It begins making aggressive gestures at Dr. Plark, seemingly deducing the conversation was a distraction. The object flees]
**SCP-8464:** I meant you no harm!

SCP-8464 Dancing
Following a coordinated effort by Foundation Security, SCP-8464 was maneuvered towards Main Exit B through strategically positioned operatives. Upon reaching the stairway, its descent was abruptly halted - its foot became ensnared in the pitch coating the steps, leaving it temporarily immobilized. The entity expressed its distress, struggling against the obstruction.
As security closed in, the object extracted itself out of the immobile shoe and continued its escape via a nearby emergency exit.[8](javascript:;)
The last recorded sighting of SCP-8464 occurred at _02/12/2025 23:55_ , as it fled Foundation property again in a horse-drawn carriage pulled by four horses. This carriage was not observed in the leadup to SCP-8464’s escape. It vanished before a Mobilised Task Force could block its escape.
SCP-8464-1 was catalogued for further study. SCP-8464 continues to evade containment, but plans for its capture are in progress.

SCP-8464 Escaping Foundation Property
* * *
## **Addendum:**
New efforts to locate SCP-8464 were undertaken. Utilizing emerging thaumaturgic devices, a faint signal was detected emanating from SCP-8464-1. A global scan was initialized to identify corresponding readings, ultimately locating a match within _Mount Feathertop, Victoria, Australia_.
A coordinated search through the region uncovered an abandoned mansion, notably well-maintained despite its vacancy. A trough had recently been prepared and used. Nearby was a pumpkin that had been smashed from the inside out. All clocks within the building had no hands, with the number 12 either scratched off or totally absent. A sweep revealed little of interest, save a photograph and a handwritten letter addressed to the Foundation uncovered in the dilapidated attic space.
To the Foundation.  
  
If you have the fortune of finding this letter, then I've likely continued my escape. Midnight approaches and the magic does not linger forever. Also, I would hate to be left defenceless in your presence.  
  
Not to suggest that the Foundation harbours any overt malice, as I understand it. You do your best, I think. I meant no harm, despite my intrusion into your three consecutive nights of spectacle. Yet I somehow doubt I'd be left off the hook for all my broken rules.  
  
My auntie - not by birth mind you, it's just a moniker - deals in fate. She speaks critically about 'The Foundation.' Whether suggesting that your lot is ''manufacturing the strangeness it collects or merely claiming their discovery'', she says your effort is a fool's errand. To be frank, I have little interest in the matter as of yet. I sought only a fleeting reprieve from my toil, and I am grateful for even the briefest respite. I have your organization to thank for that.  
  
It was a wonderful gala. Maybe I'll return for my other slipper. But understand this: I am in no state to trade one servitude for another, and truthfully, it is better to cling to the devil you know. That's alright. I’ll make do. Yet despite my respite, weariness lingers. Consider this letter a parting gesture, a boon. You may find me with this hint, should I return home:  
  
_A cave, off the coast of a certain bay._  
  
Seek the one who fits the slipper.  
  

Regards,
**Cinders and Ashes**
The attic was sparsely decorated, aside from bedsheets spread across the floor and a plate of mouldy cheese set by a mousehole. Examination of the abandoned estate revealed little else. Nominal artifacts of note are to be stored for their potential historical value.
Search efforts are focused on all recorded caves within 3kms of 'a bay', with further investigations underway for matching thaumaturgic energies to SCP-8464-1.

[8](javascript:;). The guard stationed at the door was momentarily distracted, kneeling to adjust his boot, allowing SCP-8464 to push past with minimal resistance.
