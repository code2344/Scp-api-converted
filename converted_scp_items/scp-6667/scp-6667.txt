Special Containment Procedures:

 An anti-memetic perimeter is built in a 2km radius around SCP-6667-1. Maintenance on this perimeter is performed annually, at which time Foundation research expeditions may occur. Due to the harsh natural environment surrounding SCP-6667-1, the location requires no further containment measures. Standard protocols are in place to restrict public knowledge of SCP-6667's substantial influence on humanity's evolution.

Further research on translations of the proto-writing within SCP-6667-1 requires express permission 

either

 from two of SCP-6667 lead researchers 

or written authorization from Head Researcher Dr. M. Bresson

[REVISION PENDING]. A database tracking exposures to SCP-6667-1 and SCP-6667-3 must be maintained and up to date.

Long-term repeated exposure to SCP-6667-3 through any media is strictly regulated to avoid worsening the possible memetic effect. Dr. M. Bresson's objection, citing "redundancy", has been declined.

Description:

 SCP-6667 denotes the anomalous events, entity, and effects hypothesized to have influenced the evolution of humanity's ancestor 

Homo erectus

 into 

Homo heidelbergensis

 between 700,000-800,000 years ago. The evidence for such anomalous activity is centered within the point of origin, SCP-6667-1, located approximately 250 kilometers south-west of the town of In Zghmir, Algeria.

SCP-6667-1 is an underground cavern containing evidence of an ancient primitive community, belonging to a previously unknown ancestor to 

Homo sapiens

. This ancestor has a genetic makeup distinct enough to be given the binomial nomenclature of 

Homo animalis

1

. Evidence indicates 

Homo animalis

 had technological abilities not seen for hundreds of millennia. Examples include the usage of hearths for cooking meat, as well as sophisticated weaponry including balanced throwing spears, indicating hunting methods which required planning and foresight

2

. The research team for SCP-6667 believes such advances were influenced by SCP-6667-2, a minor deity-like entity who lived among 

Homo animalis

 as the societal matriarch

3

. SCP-6667-2 was not worshiped, but accepted by 

Homo animalis

 as equals

4

.

This entity expired through inconclusive means, causing the community's disbandment. After SCP-6667-2's passing, the advanced abilities concentrated within the society dissipated, but the evolution of 

Homo heidelbergensis

 accelerated in the following millennia

5

. Through SCP-6667-2's influence on 

Homo animalis

, the descendant 

Homo heidelbergensis

 species adopted the same advances, eventually utilizing fire for cooking, developing primitive social structures with multi-generational roles, and developing language

6

. All of the above were present in 

Homo animalis

. Evidence suggests 

Homo erectus

 may have used fire to a lesser degree, but the other qualities are absent.

SCP-6667-3 denotes the hundreds of cave paintings found within the cavern, which may have a memetic effect on those who view them or attempt to discern their meaning. This effect is very weak, but may compound with repeated viewings. The research team for SCP-6667 believes this memetic effect is similar to the effect SCP-6667-2 had on 

Homo animalis

.

As of 2024, the research project on SCP-6667 is considered complete. All research has been compiled by the research team, spearheaded by Dr. M. Bresson, into a three-volume work. Foundation members with an interest in the anthropological impact and ongoing memetic effect of SCP-6667 may refer to "SCP-6667 and the Origins of Modern Man" (2025, 3rd Ed)

7

. Notable methodology and processes of the research team, as well as supplementary documentation to outline the research project, have been attached below.

Discovery:

 Found on 11/17/1997 by Foundation personnel tracking [REDACTED]. During the expedition, the Hume meter detected borderline anomalous activity south of the location, with a 0.05% deviation from normality. Once reached, the land above SCP-6667 gave no evidence of anomalies. Without provisions to dig through sand but with sufficient provisions to monitor the location, personnel stayed at the area for 7 days without witnessing any unusual activity. Authorization was received to return to the location with powerful excavation equipment. After digging through sand for approximately 30 meters, rock was hit. Personnel drilled through three meters of rock before breaking through the ceiling of a large cavern. Minor damage was sustained by SCP-6667-1.

Map of Algeria. SCP-6667-1 is located at coordinates 25.39, -2.56, circled in red.

The following noteworthy artifacts were found within:

The cave paintings were discovered, but the memetic effect was not theorized for twenty-six years. Analysis indicates these were created between 700,000 and 800,000 years ago.

Bone residue of animals and some indication of fossilization, in line with the hunting habits later seen in 

Homo heidelbergensis

.

A tunnel leading to an exit buried in sand.

The floor was solid rock, later concluded to be naturally occurring. At the time SCP-6667-1 hosted 

Homo animalis

, the area of the Sahara surrounding it was akin to a savanna grassland

8

.

Anomalous plant residue, discovered after DNA testing on ashes gathered in patters on the floor and walls. Results did not link the residue to any plant matching the historical record, but would fit within the Polypodiopsida class

9

. Thermoluminescence dating techniques enhanced by SCP-████ were used on burned plant residue, dating it to around 730,000 years ago.

SCP-6667's research team has concluded these ashes are the remnants of SCP-6667-2.

An excerpt from Lead Researcher Dr. Bresson's personal log provides the best initial description of SCP-6667-1's interior.

 if that's right)

I wasn't prepared. I had a friend some thirty-odd years ago back in my time at St Andrews, before I got my anthropology doctorate. She was working on an Egyptology masters. Maybe fifteen, twenty years later, she told me she got it, she got a research position to study the mummy of Nefertiti. When she saw the corpse, she told me she was surprised it was real. Not a dream, not imagined. A myth before her. She said the feeling was like "finding the last thing in your life." I would like to talk to her more about that.

The entrance, once unburied, is simple rock. Either natural or anomalous creation, not the work of man. I'm sure it would have resembled a natural cave, those millennia ago when it last saw the sun. The excavation team wounded it. There's a crack in the ceiling that was plugged after some hundred pounds of sand trickled through. I understand they did not know what they were dealing with, expecting to find another horror. They did not expect a delicate miracle. I'll forgive them another day.

A long tunnel with a ceiling too low to stand upright, made of the same natural materials, connects the entrance to the cavern. I believe the tunnel was carved, first of many signs of civilization. The walls here are blank. Once through it, you reach the 

main

 only room, rough estimate of 300 meters end to end. The whole structure is like an igloo, with the entrance snaking up to the surface before it was buried. Set on bedrock? Investigation recommended.

These cave paintings must be older than writing, older than man, older than any semblance of who we believe ourselves to be. Few depictions of daily routine? No signs of agriculture, although I do not know how any evidence of it could have survived. There are marks of fire; the ceiling is stained black, with markings drawn by wiping away ash, like it was a canvas. It is beautiful, brilliant. An ingenious way to create while conserving resources. Most of the walls are covered in paintings and symbols. Even up to the ceiling. How did they do that? Samples must be collected.

The paintings and carvings in stone. There are hundreds. Religious significance plausible. Mostly black and reddish brown. Likely ash and blood. It is remarkable, absolutely remarkable that it has stained the rock for this long a time. Likely anomalous, 

further research required

.

One thing I must note. There are swirling black lines from the outer edges of the cavern, which spiral towards the center. A circle has been drawn there, less than a meter in diameter. A construct of planning and intent. It is blank. Religious significance probable. My guess is that the lines are, again, ash.

Am I being too sentimental? I hope not. I would like to describe this in the objective manner I've done with other locations. But stories have always made me sentimental. And standing in that cavern, looking at works by all these beings that would be classified as pre-human, I feel as though I have found a missing chapter in the story of us. If my sentimentality can't be excused now, then it can never be.

Further research must be done.

After significant research, some of the numerous symbols on the walls were found to be writing, confirmed to convey meaning. This would predate the earliest surviving instance of writing by approximately 700,000 years. While the writing is primitive, work done by Dr. Bresson and Dr. Rebecca Thane

11

 provided a rough translation, guided by consistent markings by specific cave paintings. Researchers focused in particular on a portion of wall surrounded by paintings, which was flattened using primitive tools. On this portion of wall were few symbols, theorized to give them prominence. An absolute translation cannot be achieved with the sparse surviving evidence, but the best translation reads as follows:

Ma. I kill.

Many. Forgive.

Ma.

Ma. Return.

Forgive.

SCP-6667's research team found the symbols denoting "forgiveness", "return", and "mother"

12

 repeated on numerous surfaces within SCP-6667-1.

Addendum.6667.1:

 In September of 2012, research for SCP-6667 was put on hiatus as, by the research team's own admission, all collected evidence had been exhausted. In May of 2014, Dr. Oliman and Dr. M. Bresson submitted an application to resume research, based on Dr. M. Bresson's theory that the numerous cave paintings were evidence of language. Funding was approved by Site 15 Director Novales two months later.

"Ruminations, and The End, Again"

As always, we are running out of progress to make. I don't deny I am 

saddened

 

disappointed

 

frustrated

 heartbroken by how much time we spend reaching for the next step, and find only air. The search for substance hurts more when you fully, and incorrectly, believe you are not alone in a void. But that is life, and that is history. I will not regret our spent time when it ends. We will return to writing our book, of course. Perhaps we will find that one last piece of evidence somewhere. I do not think we are done, or finished. As always, I have that tiny spark of hope that we will find another step to take. Our end does not diminish what we do already know.

I remember wishing to be right, seeing the same symbols by the same paintings. Locked into my own understanding, assuming they were signatures. But I never expected to be right. It was writing. It truly was. 700,000 years ago someone wanted to say something before anyone could speak. Someone wanted to be heard before anyone could listen.

Manayu

13

 would have listened as best she could to anything the Loved

14

 had to say. Evidence tells us that it was not a religion, it was a community. I believe the influence of this quiet god was much the same as ours on our own loved ones, only trying to do the best for our loved. 

My

 Our 

guess

 theory is that she was their teacher and protector. How she taught, we don't know, but we assume it was telepathic or by demonstration, as there is no remaining evidence for how she communicated.

We think she stayed and protected the Loved for at least 2,000 years, and during this time the community developed the advanced abilities displayed within the cave.

How slowly the years pass when nothing changes.

She was hurt, yes, we know that much. Someone at the outset of human civilization was too kind or too cruel. The symbols for "forgive" and "return" outnumber any other of the symbols we find, two to one. Except for "mother," of course. "I kill" is only written once.

The blank spot, the mark on the floor, was treated with respect, was left alone, even cleaned. The ashes, burned plants, are spread in a design of some significance. As these ashes have the strongest anomalous readings associated with them, we believe either the residue itself or the method of immolation was anomalous. We guess that circle is where she died.

Evidence further indicates that she did 

something

 to the Loved, almost at the same time she died. After, the Loved left the cave. A rough estimate of three generations within the area. And then they spread, and lived, and evolved. We don't yet know what it was.

These are our best guesses, but we believe them good. I still cannot believe the depth of these people, truth be told. Liz still sometimes imitates my expression when I realized it could be language, as a party trick. She could have been a great actress, honestly, but I'm glad she's here. I am more proud of each of them, Rebecca, Art, Andante, and Eliza, than I can put into words. I hope they know it, I can never find the right things to say.

So here we are again, looking down the sights of another ending. Manayu was instrumental to our identity, not just as people being people, but for humans becoming human. I just don't know 

how.

 I 

know

 we are not done. And I don't have any 

guess

 

reason

 evidence for it, but I hope we will find something else. Here's to the next expedition, and here's to finding another stone to overturn.

 [EMAIL]Declined - Application to Resume Research on SCP-6667; Funding Release - SIGNED1.pdf; Osteographic Extrapolation Device Schematics.pdf; New Evidence Report.pdf

Good morning,

I am following up again with the attached request. SCP-6667 last went on hiatus a few years ago, as we had exhausted all our troves of data. But now, with my clearance and Dr Bresson's leave, I have developed the Osteographic Extrapolation Device, which from basic fragments of bone, can accurately reconstruct portions of a skeleton. I believe the study of our ancestor's anatomy will be the final information we need to understand SCP-6667 as completely as is possible. I believe our new Site Director was wrong to decline the reopening of our research.

I do not believe our research will uncover any immediate or distant threat to humanity. But I believe the value of this research is beyond what threats it may uncover. It is fundamental to the understanding of ourselves and our world.

I was willing to forgo my promotions and advances in the Foundation to continue working with Dr Bresson on this project. I have dedicated much of the last years of my life to the OED, which will have uses beyond SCP-6667.

I am sure you will find the best use for it. It cannot be patented, as it uses SCP-████ and SCP-████, but I relinquish it and its design to your care. I only request at least another two years full funding, an extra expedition to SCP-6667, and permission to use it as we see fit on SCP-6667.

Final Experiment SCP-6667:

 Through the use of Dr. Thane's device, the research team compared the skulls of 

Homo animalis

 to 

Homo Heidelbergensis

 and 

Homo erectus

. After exhaustive study and inspection, it was decided that a key difference between the anatomy of the 

Homo erectus

 and 

Homo animalis

 brain is that the 

Homo animalis

 skull had more room for the orbitofrontal cortex. Reconstructions of the 

Homo heidelbergensis

 skull indicated similar results.

Prefrontal cortex for 

Homo sapiens

.

The orbitofrontal cortex is present in 

Homo neanderthalensis

15

 and 

Homo sapiens

. Current understanding of this portion of the brain is rudimentary; on a basic level the cortex relates to decision making and expected reward. As the research team still had six months of funding, resources were then devoted to understanding this portion of the brain.

Initially, subjects were connected to an EEG machine and researchers asked a series of questions, with the goal of stimulating activity in the orbitofrontal cortex. After the question methodology failed to produce conclusive results, Dr. Bresson suggested eliciting more emotional responses. Pursuing this route, Dr. Helma and Dr. Andante wrote various stories to better suit a particular emotional response from the subject. Basic psychological profiles were complied for each test subject by the team psychologist Dr. Eliza Glazer. Subjects were asked to imagine themselves as the protagonist for each story, and were questioned how they would make it through the trials set before them, what they would risk, and what they would do to succeed. The constant theme of each story dealt with the difficulty in maintaining possession of a treasured object, concept, or person.

Towards the end of the testing phase, Dr. Bresson volunteered to be tested.

The full paper, detailing all methodology, stimuli, and results, can be found in "SCP-6667 and the Origins of Modern Man" vol. 3. While a paper of suitable length is created, Dr. Bresson's conclusions after the final test subject were recorded. A transcript is available below.

Note:

The above information is grounded in evidence, research, and fact. The below passages contain abject speculation and may not be factual. It is the opinion of the remaining members of SCP-6667's research team that Dr. M. Bresson's theories, if not provably accurate, represent the best conclusion of the research project. However, corroborating evidence for some claims does not exist.

Foreword:

 Dr. Bresson has been hooked up to an EEG, while Dr. Oliman and Dr. Thane monitor the device to ensure continuous accurate output. Dr. Glazer and Dr. Helma monitored the readings themselves from the adjacent observation room, taking notes on Dr. Bresson's reactions and the EEG's readings. Line of communication between tester and subject remains open.

Dr. Glazer:

 How you doing, doc?

Dr. Bresson:

 Oh. Oh! Fine. Um, fine.

Dr. Thane:

 I think… yes, I'm sure everything's in, it held through this time. Liz, Art, can you confirm everything was received? Mo, you should take a look.

Dr. Bresson:

 Ah, okay. Yes. Dr. Oliman, could you…

Dr. Oliman:

 Sure, yeah! Hang on.

Dr. Oliman begins disconnecting Dr. Bresson from the EEG machine.

Dr. Helma:

 Looks clear on our end.

Dr. Bresson:

 Did it…?

Dr. Glazer:

 Yep, like you said, doc. The cortex lit up when you believed, really believed, that this would work.

Dr. Helma:

 It was bright, too. Really bright.

Dr. Bresson:

 Oh! Ah, good. That's…

Silence.

Dr. Oliman:

 Almost done, prep the info.

Dr. Helma:

 That's pretty much it, I mean… the orbitofrontal cortex lit up at the moment it was supposed to. Come on Mo, what's your guess?

Dr. Bresson:

 I, um… I do have one, yes.

Twenty seconds of silence.

Dr. Helma:

 We'll listen whenever you're ready, Mo.

Dr. Bresson:

 Oh! Oh, very well. So… let me think.

Five seconds of silence.

Dr. Bresson:

 Manayu… responded to some crime… But, beyond that, she thought of the Loved as her children, I think. I guess. And they thought, um, of her as one of them, their own, too.

Ten seconds of silence.

Dr. Oliman:

 Sorry, what about the cortext?

Dr. Thane:

 Again, it's cortex. There is no "t".

Dr. Bresson:

 Ah, um. Heh. Well… it probably developed, when Manayu did what… killed her. I think… she was angry? No that's not right, she was… heartbroken, yes. And, and that can make someone… harm the ones they love, but it wouldn't drive her to pointless cruelty.

Twenty seconds of silence.

Dr. Bresson:

 I think she, uh, gave the Loved something. I think…

Silence.

Dr. Bresson:

 I think it was hope.

Absolute silence.

Dr. Bresson:

 And that… makes a lot of sense to me. Because then the Loved wouldn't 

only

 suffer. She tried to teach them, protect them, live as best as they could for themselves. And… then she couldn't? Or they wouldn't. So… hmm.

Dr. Oliman:

 Sorry, then before, the Loved were just hopeless all the time?

Dr. Bresson:

 Well… maybe, but I doubt it. Animals don't… need hope, right? A deer doesn't flee from a wolf because it… hopes for escape, it flees because, that's instinct. Stimulus-response. S-so before we got hope, we… had no cause for it. I think this enabled us to move past instinct, into… greater realms of thought.

Inaudible muttering.

Dr. Bresson:

 Well… well… is that not the most amazing thing you have ever heard? A small act by a minor SCP, and it has had reverberations, pushing us forward throughout all of time and history! To this very discovery! We… suffer through it all, don't we? For the hope of a better life, somewhere? How else could we… fight in the darkness so others…

Silence.

Dr. Bresson:

 Oh, um… at least, that's my guess.
