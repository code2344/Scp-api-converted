**Item #:** SCP-6215
**Object Class:** Euclid
**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-6215 is to be stored in a low-security climate-controlled locker in Site-73. Access is to be granted to Level 2 personnel or higher.
**Description:** SCP-6215 refers to an anachronistic cotton shirt, recovered in a tomb outside of Tepi, Ethiopia during an unrelated archeological dig. While carbon dating has placed the age of SCP-6215 at 282,000 years old, the style and manufacturing of SCP-6215 is in line with modern day industry practices.
On the front of SCP-6215 is an image alongside text. The image depicts a stylized cartoon snake coiled around the base of a date palm tree, whose leaves are noticeably wilted. The text is written in a previously unknown proto-Sabaean language. Translation efforts are ongoing.
**Addendum.1:** Since initial containment on 01/11/1974, several objects of similar age and anachronistic properties have been identified by the Foundation, including near-identical copies of SCP-6215. A selection has been presented below.
Designation | Location of Recovery | Description  
---|---|---  
SCP-6215-1 | Templo Mayor, Mexico | Several plastic rings molded together to form a ball. Small aluminum half-spheres are embedded in each ring. When left unattended, SCP-6215-1 will float one meter above the ground.  
SCP-6215-21 | Dead Sea, Jordan | A stuffed plush snake with plastic eyeballs. When squeezed, SCP-6215-21's eyes will bulge out of its body, emitting a hissing vocalization through unknown means.  
SCP-6215-78 | Yangtze River, China | A single-use plastic cup in the shape of a half-bitten apple. Analysis of the item's interior have detected trace amounts of a liquid identical to that of Coca-Cola.  
The Foundation estimates the number of these items to be approximately 1,400. Containment efforts are ongoing.
