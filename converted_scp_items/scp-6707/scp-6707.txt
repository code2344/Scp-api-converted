Item #: SCP-6707

Keter

Special Containment Procedures:

 Foundation personnel, embedded in academic extraterrestrial expeditions, must obfuscate studies on SCP-6707's known spread across the universe.

Description:

 SCP-6707 designates several species of carbon-based organisms. Generally, SCP-6707 species bear multiple appendages, attached to a central stalk supporting the organism's weight. Specimens exercise phototropism, growing to receive maximum light (generally from Earth's sun). Additional green appendages convert this light into sustenance for the primary organism, while additional appendages on the organism's bottom ground it and collect further sustenance.

SCP-6707 forms a fundamental aspect of Earth's climate and numerous human cultures.

As far as extrasolar exploration can ascertain, no SCP-6707 instances or equivalent organisms exist beyond Earth.

Reclassifying as Explained again, with clarification why. We have no clue what further explorations may bring. Hold off for a bit.

I figure we should have descriptions of what other planets *do* have. Not all of us completely understand what "boronic nutrient production" is.

Reclassifying as Explained, yet again. Surely, in an infinite universe, there exists one other planet with trees.

the new archon class works pretty well for this. a bit silly to attempt to contain trees, don't you think?
