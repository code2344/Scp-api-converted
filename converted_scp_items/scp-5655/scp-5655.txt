Item #:

 SCP-5655

Object Class:

 Safe

Special Containment Procedures:

 SCP-5655 is to remain closed and contained in a small storage container at Site-08. Use of SCP-5655 outside of testing is prohibited.

Description:

 SCP-5655 is an empty can of Spam which, when shaken or turned over, will manifest SCP-5655-1. SCP-5655-1 is a 7.5cm translucent red humanoid with reality-bending capabilities. When given a request beginning with the words "I wish", SCP-5655-1 will alter reality in an attempt to fulfill the request. However, SCP-5655-1's limited reality-altering capabilities will often result in requests being only loosely fulfilled.

Addendum:

 A series of tests were conducted to determine SCP-5655-1's ability to fulfill requests involving physical, abstract, and philosophical elements.

 I wish for an orange ball.

Result:

 A tangerine with a bite taken out of it.

 Junior Researcher Dinns reported part of his lunch spontaneously disappearing at the time of this test.

 I wish for a heavy stone.

Result:

 A 2.2kg stone.

Additional Notes:

 Stone manifested above SCP-5655-1's upstretched arms, crushing it.

 SCP-5655-1 lifted the stone from the previous test above its head, set the stone down, then pointed at itself.

.

Incident 5655.1

< BEGIN LOG >

Researcher Alami:

 I wish for a way to balance the Foundation's budget.

(SCP-5655-1 rubs its chin and paces back and forth for several seconds.)

SCP-5655-1:

 To be perfectly honest Ms. Alami, I don't think I can grant your wish.

Researcher Alami:

 You can talk?!

SCP-5655-1:

 Why are you surprised? This is the least impressive thing you've seen me do.

Researcher Alami:

 I just… never mind. Why can't you grant my wish?

SCP-5655-1:

 It's a matter of safety. I don't know if you're aware of this, but your reality is dangerously unstable. As a consequence, my job is quite a lot like a game of—

Researcher Alami:

 Don't say 

Kerplunk

.

SCP-5655-1:

 …my job is quite a lot like a game of 

Jenga

. Every time I grant a wish, I'm pulling another piece out of the tower and hoping that the whole thing doesn't topple over. I've been limiting myself when it came to your other wishes, but the amount of reality manipulation it would take to grant this wish, in 

any

 capacity, would likely cause your reality to collapse. For both legal and ethical reasons, I can't do it.

Researcher Alami:

 But you're a genie. Like you said, granting wishes is your job.

SCP-5655-1:

 Yes, but there are rules and regulations for these sorts of things. 

(A small sheaf of papers manifests in SCP-5655-1's hand)

 Article 8, Section 2 of the "Multiversal Interactions and Stability Administration" handbook very clearly states that "Should an act of reality manipulation place a severe enough strain on the foundation of a reality that the actor believes that there is a significant risk of reality collapse, then the actor must not perform the act and is exempt from any and all duties to perform said act". My semi-transparent hands are tied.

Researcher Alami:

 Well in that case, I wish that you change the rules so that you can grant my previous wish… that my boss gave me.

SCP-5655-1:

 Ms. Alami, this is a matter of interuniversal law. As much as I'd love to help you, my wish-granting abilities don't extend to things outside of your reality.

Researcher Alami:

 So there's really nothing you can do?

(SCP-5655-1 sighs.)

SCP-5655-1:

 I'm afraid not. Usually when a genie disappoints a client like this, they offer to alter the client's mind so that they are incapable of feeling disappointed; but I'm afraid that doing so would also likely destroy reality. I guess the only thing I can do is grant you a different, safer wish.

Researcher Alami:

 Yeah, I could do that. Did you have anything in mind?

SCP-5655-1:

 Nothing in particular, no… You look tired. Do you want a coffee?

Researcher Alami:

 Sure, that would be great. I mean, I wish that you got me a coffee.

SCP-5655-1:

 Your wish is my command.

(A cup of coffee manifests in front of Researcher Alami. She takes a sip.)

Researcher Alami:

 How much sugar did you put in this?

SCP-5655-1:

 Enough to make you ignore that the coffee's cold.
