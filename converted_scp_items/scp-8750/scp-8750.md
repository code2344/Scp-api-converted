**Item#:** 8750
**Clearance Level 1:** Clearance
**Containment Class:** neutralized

**Description:** SCP-8750 is a former Foundation researcher, Ashe Barker. SCP-8750 is a Type 4-U Reality Bender.[2](javascript:;) SCP-8750 is currently contained at Site-97 in Brandon, Florida, where they were working when they entered an anomalous coma.[3](javascript:;) Relocation of SCP-8750 has been deemed unviable as the manifestation of anomalous properties happens regardless of SCP-8750's location. SCP-8750 has conjured up several spectral entities, designated SCP-8750-1 to SCP-8750-3. The entities manifested by SCP-8750 act out scenarios from SCP-8750's past.
**Discovery:** SCP-8750’s anomalous nature was found on 2016/12/29 when reports of a child resembling the late Jacob Barker[4](javascript:;), now designated SCP-8750-1 was reported to have been wandering the town aimlessly.
**Addendum SCP-8750.1** SCP-8750 was found to affect the area around their house.  
Reports of SCP-8750-1 led MTF Δ-29 (“Outside the Box”) to the apartment, where they established a temporary on-site location to collect data. Appearances of SCP-8750-1 also contained a second entity, identified to be a spectral version of SCP-8750, designated SCP-8750-2, as well as the occasional appearance of a third entity. This was identified as Dr. Robert Osprey,[5](javascript:;) and is designated SCP-8750-3.

> **Barker:** Okay, and? That wouldn't be my problem. This is our kid. Can you at least try to act sad?
> **Osprey:** We don't have time left to be sad. We need to try to be strong for him so he can enjoy the time he has left.
> **Barker:** I'm just… I'm not that strong, Robert.
> _He grabs her hand._
> **Osprey:** Look at him, Ashe. He's sitting there smiling in his sleep. He knows that he gets to visit his favorite theme park tomorrow.
> _He pauses for a second._
> **Osprey:** I know it's hard, but you have to try for him. We've got the entire weekend, let's let him enjoy the time he has left.

> **Barker:** No, you absolutely don't. You don't get a say. You lost that right years ago.
> **Osprey:** That's bullshit. He's still my kid. He has a right to know.
> **Barker:** You're only saying that for yourself. Stop being selfish.
> **Osprey:** Selfish? What a joke. You're preventing me from seeing my child in his last month just so you can have the rest of his time to yourself. You won't even tell him why I can't come around anymore.
> **Barker:** What happened to letting him enjoy the time he has left? You are a hypocrite.
> _Osprey looks stunned and begins crying._
> **Osprey:** Things change Ashe, I just want the opportunity to say goodbye to my kid.
> **Barker:** It isn't happening, Robert. I can't rob him of his happiness.
> **Osprey:** Then let me do it; let me tell him. We can spend the rest of the time he has left as a family again.
> **Barker:** _(crying)_ We stopped being a family ages ago. Just go.
> **Osprey:** Whatever. Just please think about it. I'm begging you. Please don't rob him of his chance to say goodbye to you.

> **< Begin Log>**
> **Barker:** _(tearing up and shouting)_ He was our child; why are you being so insensitive?
> **Osprey:** You need to let go Ashe, it’s been six goddamn months; you think I wasn’t going through the same hell you did? It’s selfish of you to hold on so long. You need to go outside, you can't keep living like this.
> **Barker:** Fuck you! Six months isn’t long, you aren’t as devastated because you are a deadbeat who was never around!
> **Osprey:** _(shouting louder)_ Are you that self-absorbed to not realize that I loved him too? I had no choice Ashe, you kicked me out; you took me out of his life. I've tried again and again; I’ve even taken you to court several times.
> _He pauses for a moment. Barker tries to interject, but he continues._
> **Osprey:** I wasn’t even granted visitation without your permission, and now you are trying to say you loved him more than me? I didn't have an option! You are selfish, conceited, and crazy.
> **Barker:** _(gasps)_ Excuse me? You didn’t even fucking ask! You never made an effort; you just berated me for how I raised him! You expect me to move on, but I based my entire life around him! He was my child! Mine!
> **Osprey:** Do you not even hear yourself? He was our child!
> _He pauses for a moment before continuing._
> **Osprey:** He’s gone now. What is moping around, blaming me, and doing nothing with your goddamn life gonna do for you? It’s so selfish of you. You barely go to work anymore and keep lounging around. How about you grow up? Grow the fuck up, Ashe. It's embarassing.
> **Barker:** You have the audacity to come into my house, insult me, tell me to move on, and tell me how to live my life? You are just as uncaring as ever, Robert! I thought you of all people could have understood my pain!
> _Barker pauses for a moment._
> **Barker:** (mumbling) Get out.
> **Osprey:** What?
> **Barker:** Get the fuck out of my house!
> _They both go silent for a moment._
> **Osprey:** Alright. I’ll go.
> _Osprey gets up, heads to the door, and opens it._
> **Osprey:** I mean it, you need to move the fuck on.
> _The door slams shut, and they de-manifest._
