TOP SECRET DOCUMENTS
**Item #:** SCP-1796
**Object Class:** Safe
**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1796 is to be held within a standard containment locker, located in the basement floor of Site-██'s Safe SCP wing. No personnel who have previously authored containment documentation are to interact with SCP-1796, and anyone without Level 4 clearance or above is forbidden from accessing SCP-1796. All documents produced by SCP-1796 are to be stored in Site-██'s anomalous media archive. Testing with SCP-1796 is currently restricted, pending a review of Site-██'s archives.
**Description:** SCP-1796 is a yellow manila envelope. The words "To ███" are written on the back of the envelope in red ink, with the address covered using black ink.
When a piece of paper containing information is inserted into SCP-1796 for more than ██ seconds, its content is modified to reinsert any concealed information not already written on the paper. Any expunged data, such as black boxes or expunged segments, are replaced with the actual suppressed information—repeated insertion of the modified paper into the anomaly results in further alteration and clarification of the initial information.
Some clear expunged info can remain after the first insertions, but this will be clarified after repeating the action a few times. It is unclear what specific type of information SCP-1796 targets first.
