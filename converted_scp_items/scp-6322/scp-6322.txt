Item #:

 SCP-6322

Object Class:

 Safe

Special Containment Procedures:

 SCP-6322 is currently held in a soundproof object containment locker at Site-19. Personnel conducting testing on SCP-6322 must do so inside a specialized chamber rated at Sound Transmission Class 50 or higher, and are required to wear protective active noise canceling equipment and to cover skin when handling the object, even in its inactive state.

Description:

 SCP-6322 is a sphere of unidentified gemstone measuring 10cm in diameter. When SCP-6322 comes into contact with human skin for longer than 3 minutes, the object emits a 115 decibel ringing sound. Organic creatures in a .5km radius of the object who hear this sound without protective equipment experience rapid lung consolidation

History:

 The Foundation was alerted to the existence of SCP-6322 following interception of communications between Marshall, Carter, and Dark Ltd. and a client regarding the shipment of the object via the United States Postal Service. Foundation operatives successfully rerouted the package containing SCP-6322 to Sloth’s Pit, Wisconsin, where it was to be recovered by Unit 87 of Mobile Task Force Alpha-4 (“Pony Express”) and returned to Dr. Franklin Hays, head of the SCP-6322 project. Captain Daniel Byrne of Mobile Task Force Delta-5 ("Front Runners") was sent to oversee transport of SCP-6322 back to Site-19. Unit 87 was chosen as the first point of contact due to Site-87 being the largest and closest Foundation site, as well as the Sloth's Pit postal warehouse being specially equipped for similar scenarios.

Notice to MTF A-4 U87

Our sources at Site-19 have intercepted a message confirming that the Chaos Insurgency is going to make a play for the object. Your jobs just became marginally more difficult, but as always I have complete faith in your ability. No doubt you have met Captain Byrne; you may utilize him as you see fit to conduct the operation. Retrieval of the object is of utmost importance. Please review your protocol regarding violent countermeasures taken on civilian property and prepare accordingly.

Godspeed, Pony Express.

Neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night,

Commander Cowley

Miranda you're not gonna believe this

Phone log from a call between Captain Daniel Byrne and Commander Melina Cowley

[Begin Log]

Cowley:

 That would be the long and short of it. Quick work; in the best case scenario we’ll have it secured before the Insurgency even arrives.

Byrne:

 Very quick work.

Cowley:

 You sound trepidatious, is there something you’re worried about?

Byrne:

 Maybe. It’s a dangerous object. It was reckless of them to send it through the mail in the first place. I just wonder about all this.

Cowley:

 You wonder about what?

Byrne:

 I mean- I don’t want to be rude, please don’t misconstrue what I’m saying-

Cowley:

 What ARE you saying?

Byrne:

 No offense, but don’t we have people who are better qualified for something like this? With the Insurgency involved? Shouldn’t we bring somebody else in? As backup? My guys could EASILY handle-

Cowley:

 It’s coming through the post. That’s what our job is. That’s what we’re here for.

Byrne:

 What happens if it gets rocky? Or violent? Are your people- are you guys even trained for that?

Cowley:

 Yes.

Byrne:

 Sorry. Don’t need to get your feelings hurt.

[Cowley snorts]

Cowley:

 Sweetheart. I’ve worked clerk at a post office during the Holidays. Nothing you can say could hurt my feelings.

[Byrne is silent for several seconds]

Byrne:

 Fine. I’ll work with what I’ve got. I won’t call anybody else in.

Cowley:

 Good, because you don’t get to make that decision in the first place.

[Agent Baxter enters the conference room and crosses to shake Captain Byrne’s hand]

Baxter:

 Oh hi, there! You must be Captain Byrne! Great to meet ‘cha!

Byrne:

 Captain Baxter, nice to meet you.

Baxter:

 Ope, it’s just Agent Baxter. But you can call me Perry! The ladies nominated me as second-in-command. Our captain was Captain Harold Darvish, but we hasn’t seen him since he fell in the Pit.

Byrne:

 Since he fell… into the Pit.

Baxter:

 Yep! Hope he’s doin’ okay in there. Probably is. Smart guy. Anyways, what can I do ya for?

Byrne:

 I’m just here touching base about the operation. The package should arrive in two days. I wanted to make sure you were ready.

Baxter:

 ‘Course! My guys are so excited, we hasn’t seen Chaos Insurgency in our neck a’ the woods since the Vikings won the Super Bowl.

Byrne:

 HAVE the Vikings ever won the Super Bowl?

Baxter:

 Nope! Ya see what I did there?

[Agent Baxter laughs. Captain Byrne attempts to laugh]

Byrne:

 Um, yes. I just have to ask, are you sure you’re ready for something like this? Dangerous object, possible… violent intervention?

Baxter:

 ‘Course we are! ‘S why I wore my heavy duty gear!

Byrne:

 Your heavy duty- now? You’re wearing it right now?

Baxter:

 Sure am, guy.

2

Byrne:

 That? That’s your gear?

Baxter:

 Steel toe shoes. And listen!

[Agent Baxter raps against his chest. It makes a hollow knocking noise]

Baxter:

 Get to use my fancy bulletproof vest. Even though we don’t really like guns.

Byrne:

 You don’t like guns. Of course you don’t like guns…

Baxter:

 No guns. We try to get everybody out alive, enemies too.

Byrne:

 That's insane. You realize that's insane, right? I'm gonna kill some CI's if I have to.

Baxter:

 Not so long as I'm still honorary Captain, you're not.

[Captain Byrne and Agent Baxter stare at each other.]

[Agent Baxter smiles.]

Baxter:

 But I’ll tell ya, really looking forward to working with ya! We’ll get that box taken care of, yes sir.

[Captain Byrne says nothing for several seconds]

Byrne:

 Baxter, listen. I’m gonna be honest with you. I’m from Delta-5, based out of Site-19. I’m sure you’ve heard of us. We deal with REAL issues. We solve REAL problems. When it comes to leading your team, I’m not gonna tell you what to do, just know that if need be, we can have a backup team of… better prepared agents to help out.

Baxter:

 ‘Preciate it, but between you and me, we’ve never needed more than the five of us. Four of us now, I suppose. Pretty capable when it comes to the post. Little's a real heavy hitter, Buckley throws a wicked fastball, and Singh might be small but she knows the warehouse like the back of her hand.

Byrne:

 What does pitching a fastball have to do with- with anything?

Baxter:

 Comes in handy sometimes.

Byrne:

 Alright, Agent Baxter. This has been… informative, but I have other business I need to attend to. I’ll be in touch.

Baxter:

 ‘Djeet?

Byrne:

 …I beg your pardon?

Baxter:

 It’s 6:30, wanna go for some food? A beer?

Byrne:

 I think I’m just going to go back to my hotel.

Text messages between Captain Byrne and Delta-5 Agent Tim Miranda

I'm becoming increasingly certain that every last one of these poor fucks is going to die.

oh no

theyre not that bad are they

They barely have armor. They don't even use guns.

yikes

I'm going to have to carry this operation myself or it's going to be easy money for the Insurgency

how many on the team?

Five counting me.

no guns? really?

Their weird leader says they "don't like them"

well the insurgency does

[Begin Log]

Byrne:

 Alright, Baxter. I think we need to talk strategy.

Baxter:

 Oh, no worries, bud! We’ve got a real good one already.

Byrne:

 Do you? Because I haven’t heard anything about that.

Baxter:

 ‘S because it ain’tcher job, is it? You’re here to get it back to Nineteen, aren’t ya?

Byrne:

 Yes, but it’s pretty obvious you’re going to need all the help you can get.

Baxter:

 Oh-kay, if you really want to help so bad, you’re welcome to come on by. So long as you don’t get in our way, ‘s a horse apiece to me.

Byrne:

 I’m trying to save your lives, you folksy bastard. The Insurgency aren’t polite and they don’t play nice. You don’t even have armor.

Baxter:

 Whoa there, guy. No need for name calling. We don’t need armor, it slows ya down. Gotta keep ‘er movin’ in our line of work. You’ll see.

[Agent Baxter pats Captain Byrne’s shoulder]

Baxter:

 We might not be so much like other Task Forces, but we know what we’re about. And things don't work the same here as they do where you're from.

Byrne:

 Elaborate.

Baxter:

 Let's say we've got quite the home field advantage in our neck of the woods. 'Specially in that warehouse.

Byrne:

 Yeah, I’ll believe it when I see it, Fargo.

 3 November 2012

Note:

 The package containing SCP-6322 arrived with the last shipment at approximately 4:30pm. At 5:10pm, the warehouse is evacuated under pretext of a minor gas leak. MTF Alpha-4 U87 agents Baxter, Buckley, Singh and Little are stationed inside the warehouse alongside MTF Delta-5 Captain Byrne. Agent Baxter advises Capt. Byrne to stand in the center floor of the warehouse. Capt. Byrne is the only agent equipped with a firearm and full tactical armor. Six Chaos Insurgency agents, Designated Agents A-F, arrive at the warehouse at 10:42pm.
