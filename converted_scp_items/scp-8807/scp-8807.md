SCP-8807 is to be stored in the mortuary of [Site-67](/scp-8138). Access to the subject for research purposes and relevant research logs is to be requested from the Site-Director. _(Denied; see: Appendix [8807-003]. -**O5-4**.)_

**`DESCRIPTION`**
* * *
  
SCP-8807 designates the corpse of Theodore Frencoire, 179 centimeters in height, aged at 54, and of Caucasian descent. The subject displays severe radiation burns, especially around the eye area; cause of death has been identified to be radiation poisoning.
From records recovered at the site of recovery, the subject received anomalous properties after extensive human experimentation conducted by GoI-005 (”[Chaos Insurgency](/chaos-insurgency-hub)”).[1](javascript:;) Notes indicate that GoI-005 attempted to develop a ”living weapon” for utilization against the SCP Foundation and/or [the public](/scp-8870).

**[BEGIN RECORDING]**

_< Sounds of clicks of buttons of the recorder are audible. Low muttering is audible as well.>_
  
**KIERSON:** _Fucking hell…_  

_< Sounds cease. Creaking of a chair is audible.>_
  
**KIERSON:** _Okay… (clears throat)_ Operative Dirk Kierson, reporting on—  

_< Loud closing of a door is audible in background.>_
  
**KIERSON:** _(shouts)_ I’m making a recording, asshole!
**KIERSON:** _(pauses)_ Anyway… reporting on the subjects. All are in relatively good health, accounting for some bruises here and there. All of them are ready for the test trials.  

_< Silence.>_
  
**KIERSON:** So… yeah…  

_< Silence.>_

> **SUBJECT #:** 1
> **S/A/H/W/E:** Male/54/179/84/Caucasian
> **REPORT:** Subject 1 has been responding well to treatment. Reports of migraines and limb stiffness occasionally are within acceptable parameters. Resistance is dealt with via mild electrocution. Have already spoken with higher-ups about inefficiency of method & potential loss of subject; have yet to receive reply.
> First signs of development of preternatural capabilities; subject recoiled when operative Henderson entered his cell with a concealed taser. Was screaming and retreated into corner of the cell.
> Obviously, this is progress. Recommend enactment of treatment for remaining 3 subjects.

_< Clicking of a lighter is audible, followed by an exhale.>_
  
**KIERSON:** _(exhales)_ Project SOUP’s been successful so far. Testing with Subject 1 will commence in two days, while Subject 2 already went through today.  

_< Silence. Inhale. Exhale.>_
  
**KIERSON:** 2 burned his own eyes out; apparently shooting super-hot lasers out of your eyes isn’t good for your health. _(chuckles weakly, trails off)_
**KIERSON:** Subject 3 will be prepared tomorrow. Hope she fares better than 2.  

_< Silence. Long exhale. The stumping of a cigarette is heard close to the recorder.>_

_< Subject 1 stands within a barren, stark white room. He is severely malnourished, with various bruises adorning his body.>_
_< In front of him are three boxes; one is made of wood, one is made of sediment, the last made out of a metallic material.>_
_< He is shivering, frantically looking around the room.>_
_< The intercom system crackles to life. Subject 1 tenses up and recoils from it.>_
  
**KIERSON:** _(via intercom)_ Subject 1, report on what’s in the left box.
**SUBJECT 1:** _(weakly)_ P—please…  

_< In the adjoining observation room, Henderson pulls out his taser. Kierson motions for him to stand down.>_
  
**KIERSON:** You are aware of what’ll happen if you disobey orders. Now, do as I said, Subject 1.  

_< Silence. Subject 1 begins to sob.>_
_< Eventually, he looks up from the floor at the left-most box.>_
  
**SUBJECT 1:** _(sobs)_ Key…
**KIERSON:** Now the center box.
**SUBJECT 1:** S—shoe…
**KIERSON:** The right-most one.  

_< Pause. Subject 1 appears to have difficulties with the task.>_
  
**KIERSON:** Subject 1?
**SUBJECT 1:** I—I can’t see it… I can’t see it!
**KIERSON:** Are you sure!
**SUBJECT 1:** I—I can’t! I _can’t!_  

_< Subject 1 begins to hyperventilate.>_
  
**KIERSON:** _(to Henderson)_ Move him back to his cell.  

_< Henderson enters into the experimentation room. Subject 1 retreats into a far corner, crying and screaming incoherently.>_
_< Henderson pulls out his taser and incapacitates Subject 1 with it. Subject 1 immediately falls unconscious to the floor.>_

**KIERSON:** Last night’s batch of tests were a success. Subject couldn’t see through lead. Expected, given that regular radiation also can’t pierce through it.
**KIERSON:** As for Subjects 3 and 4… 3 was able to lift a small car. An entire car, stemmed on her shoulders. Then one of the men heard a _crack_. And she folded like a lawn chair. Took custodial three hours to…  

_< Silence.>_
  
**KIERSON:** Subject 4, well, froze to death. Took off high into the air, and fell back down to the ground as a popsicle. _(sighs)_
**KIERSON:** Project’s been a curse so far. Barely any results. Desirable, at least. Hope our boy fares better than the rest of ’em.

**KIERSON:** Henderson’s dead. Well, as good as dead. Radiation poisoning fucked him up.
**KIERSON:** Now, you don’t need some Ph.D or genius-level intellect to figure out what caused this. Subject 1’s been confined to a solitary cell, lead-lined. No one’s allowed in or out, except if you’re wearing a radiation suit. Won’t help for long, but at least the higher-uppies are trying to make it seem like they care for us.
**KIERSON:** New subjects just rolled in. Apparently the uppies wanna refine some previous procedures.  

_< Sound of lighter. Inhale, exhale.>_
_< Silence.>_
  
**KIERSON:** _(mutters) Fucking idiots…_

_< Sounds of muffled gunshots are audible. Heavy breathing interperses the audio occasionally.>_
  
**KIERSON:** They broke out… some of them.  

_< Clicks of a firearm is heard.>_
  
**KIERSON:** Empty magazi—  

_< Loud creaking of metal is audible.>_

SCP FOUNDATION INTERNAL MEMO  
From the office of **O5-4**  
Internal Affairs
* * *
To whom this may concern,
After our recent discovery of SCP-8807, as well as the flurry of research logs that just so happened to be on the scene, many departments have requested access to the corpse; the records even more so.
A great flurry more have even suggested that we reverse-engineer what the Insurgency was up to — to better our own weapons research projects. To all of this, I say, _no._
We will not lower our ethics for simple advancements in our research, even if said research would greatly benefit not only ourselves, but the rest of the world as a whole.
All proposals regarding this conversation topic have been, and will be, tentatively denied until further notice.  
  

_**Secure. Contain. Protect.**_
