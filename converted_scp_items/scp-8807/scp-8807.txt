RESEARCH LOG 8807-001

[BEGIN RECORDING]

 

<Sounds of clicks of buttons of the recorder are audible. Low muttering is audible as well.>

 

KIERSON:

 

Fucking hell…

 

<Sounds cease. Creaking of a chair is audible.>

 

KIERSON:

 

Okay… (clears throat)

 Operative Dirk Kierson, reporting on—

 

<Loud closing of a door is audible in background.>

 

KIERSON:

 

(shouts)

 I’m making a recording, asshole!

KIERSON:

 

(pauses)

 Anyway… reporting on the subjects. All are in relatively good health, accounting for some bruises here and there. All of them are ready for the test trials.

 

<Silence.>

 

KIERSON:

 So… yeah…

 

<Silence.>

RESEARCH LOG 8807-002

SUBJECT #:

 1

S/A/H/W/E:

 Male/54/179/84/Caucasian

REPORT:

 Subject 1 has been responding well to treatment. Reports of migraines and limb stiffness occasionally are within acceptable parameters. Resistance is dealt with via mild electrocution. Have already spoken with higher-ups about inefficiency of method & potential loss of subject; have yet to receive reply.

First signs of development of preternatural capabilities; subject recoiled when operative Henderson entered his cell with a concealed taser. Was screaming and retreated into corner of the cell.

Obviously, this is progress. Recommend enactment of treatment for remaining 3 subjects.

<Clicking of a lighter is audible, followed by an exhale.>

 

KIERSON:

 

(exhales)

 Project SOUP’s been successful so far. Testing with Subject 1 will commence in two days, while Subject 2 already went through today.

 

<Silence. Inhale. Exhale.>

 

KIERSON:

 2 burned his own eyes out; apparently shooting super-hot lasers out of your eyes isn’t good for your health. 

(chuckles weakly, trails off)

KIERSON:

 Subject 3 will be prepared tomorrow. Hope she fares better than 2.

 

<Silence. Long exhale. The stumping of a cigarette is heard close to the recorder.>

[BEGIN RECORDING]

 

<Subject 1 stands within a barren, stark white room. He is severely malnourished, with various bruises adorning his body.>

<In front of him are three boxes; one is made of wood, one is made of sediment, the last made out of a metallic material.>

<He is shivering, frantically looking around the room.>

<The intercom system crackles to life. Subject 1 tenses up and recoils from it.>

 

KIERSON:

 

(via intercom)

 Subject 1, report on what’s in the left box.

SUBJECT 1:

 

(weakly)

 P—please…

 

<In the adjoining observation room, Henderson pulls out his taser. Kierson motions for him to stand down.>

 

KIERSON:

 You are aware of what’ll happen if you disobey orders. Now, do as I said, Subject 1.

 

<Silence. Subject 1 begins to sob.>

<Eventually, he looks up from the floor at the left-most box.>

 

SUBJECT 1:

 

(sobs)

 Key…

KIERSON:

 Now the center box.

SUBJECT 1:

 S—shoe…

KIERSON:

 The right-most one.

 

<Pause. Subject 1 appears to have difficulties with the task.>

 

KIERSON:

 Subject 1?

SUBJECT 1:

 I—I can’t see it… I can’t see it!

KIERSON:

 Are you sure!

SUBJECT 1:

 I—I can’t! I 

can’t!

 

<Subject 1 begins to hyperventilate.>

 

KIERSON:

 

(to Henderson)

 Move him back to his cell.

 

<Henderson enters into the experimentation room. Subject 1 retreats into a far corner, crying and screaming incoherently.>

<Henderson pulls out his taser and incapacitates Subject 1 with it. Subject 1 immediately falls unconscious to the floor.>

KIERSON:

 Last night’s batch of tests were a success. Subject couldn’t see through lead. Expected, given that regular radiation also can’t pierce through it.

KIERSON:

 As for Subjects 3 and 4… 3 was able to lift a small car. An entire car, stemmed on her shoulders. Then one of the men heard a 

crack

. And she folded like a lawn chair. Took custodial three hours to…

 

<Silence.>

 

KIERSON:

 Subject 4, well, froze to death. Took off high into the air, and fell back down to the ground as a popsicle. 

(sighs)

KIERSON:

 Project’s been a curse so far. Barely any results. Desirable, at least. Hope our boy fares better than the rest of ’em.

RESEARCH LOG 8807-005

[BEGIN RECORDING]

 

KIERSON:

 Henderson’s dead. Well, as good as dead. Radiation poisoning fucked him up.

KIERSON:

 Now, you don’t need some Ph.D or genius-level intellect to figure out what caused this. Subject 1’s been confined to a solitary cell, lead-lined. No one’s allowed in or out, except if you’re wearing a radiation suit. Won’t help for long, but at least the higher-uppies are trying to make it seem like they care for us.

KIERSON:

 New subjects just rolled in. Apparently the uppies wanna refine some previous procedures.

 

<Sound of lighter. Inhale, exhale.>

<Silence.>

 

KIERSON:

 

(mutters) Fucking idiots…

<Sounds of muffled gunshots are audible. Heavy breathing interperses the audio occasionally.>

 

KIERSON:

 They broke out… some of them.

 

<Clicks of a firearm is heard.>

 

KIERSON:

 Empty magazi—

 

<Loud creaking of metal is audible.>

APPENDIX [8807-003]

 

SCP FOUNDATION INTERNAL MEMO

From the office of 

O5-4

Internal Affairs

To whom this may concern,

After our recent discovery of SCP-8807, as well as the flurry of research logs that just so happened to be on the scene, many departments have requested access to the corpse; the records even more so.

A great flurry more have even suggested that we reverse-engineer what the Insurgency was up to — to better our own weapons research projects. To all of this, I say, 

no.

We will not lower our ethics for simple advancements in our research, even if said research would greatly benefit not only ourselves, but the rest of the world as a whole.

All proposals regarding this conversation topic have been, and will be, tentatively denied until further notice.

 

Secure. Contain. Protect.
