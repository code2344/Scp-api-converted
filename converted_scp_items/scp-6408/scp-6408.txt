Metaphysical representation of SCP-6408.

Description:

 SCP-6408 is an oracular-shaped 

hole

 within the human noosphere, acting as a pathway to a much larger noospheric expanse. This invariably leads to foreign structures entering into consensus thought.

These foreign structures are metaphysical in nature, presenting as commands/demands. A subject's mind perceives these as subconscious thoughts and thus are acted upon without the subject's knowledge.
