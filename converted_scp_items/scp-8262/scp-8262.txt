 SCP-8262 is to be held within a standard issue storage container.

Description:

 SCP-8262 is an ornate wooden door 2 meters in height and 1 meter in width. It possesses a brass handle and a locking mechanism.

When a human subject stands within close proximity of the door, subjects often report auditory hallucinations coming from behind the door.

Hallucinations, thus far recorded, include:

Excessive knocking and banging against the door;

Rapid footsteps from behind the door;

Screams and cries from the other side of the door.

SCP-8262 was retrieved from the home of a Mr. Markus Belinger, who had locked his wife, Mrs. Abigail Belinger, within the cellar. Authorities were alerted to the scene by neighbors of "strange" smells. Upon discovery, Mr. Belinger was found to have hanged himself, while Mrs. Belinger was found dead in the cellar of dehydration.

A note was found beside Mr. Belinger, which reads:

The object was taken into custody after those present at the scene reported the same kind of auditory hallucinations.
