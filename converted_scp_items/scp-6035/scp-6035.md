**Item #:** SCP-6035
**Object Class:** Safe Neutralized
**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-6035 is currently secured in a standard high-value storage locker at [Site 73](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/secure-facilities-locations). To prevent possible reactivation of its anomalous properties, it may not be removed from its current location without permission from the Site Director.
**Description:** SCP-6035 is a vinyl LP of the 1980 album _Is This Real?_ by the punk rock band Wipers. When not activated, SCP-6035 is identical to non-anomalous vinyl records of the same album.
SCP-6035’s anomalous properties manifested when it was placed on any working turntable or other device that is intended for the use of vinyl records. When the first song, titled _Return of the Rat_ , was played, two large anthropomorphic entities resembling common brown rats (_Rattus norvegicus_) and carrying electric guitars manifested in the immediate vicinity of SCP-6035. These entities (designated SCP-6035-A and SCP-6035-B) would then proceed to act out the lyrics of the song in a mostly literal manner, and had elongated human-like arms and legs for this purpose. The subject who activated the record would be periodically interacted with as the song progressed.
Once _Return of the Rat_ concluded, the entities de-manifested and the rest of the record could be played with no anomalous effects.
**Sample SCP-6035 Test:**
Test Subject: D-53995. Subject is instructed to place SCP-6035 on the testing turntable, play the record, and observe the results.
**Song Timestamp** | **SCP-6035-A and -B Actions** | **Lyrical Equivalent**  
---|---|---  
0:00-0:10 | SCP-6035-A appears within the testing room and begins playing its guitar at 0:05. | Opening instrumental.  
0:10-0:20 | SCP-6035-A stops playing its guitar and a map of the United States appears in its hand. SCP-6035-A scrutinizes the map closely before showing it to D-53995 and pointing at it excitedly. | Corresponds to lyrics urging the listener to stay alert and remain aware due to unspecified persons arriving from throughout the country.  
0:20-0:44 | SCP-6035-A vocalizes the chorus and continues to play its guitar. These are the only words spoken by SCP-6035-A and SCP-6035-B throughout the manifestation event. | Eponymous chorus and instrumental.  
0:45-0:54 | SCP-6035-B manifests, carrying a Bible and wearing the attire of a Catholic priest. It then proceeds to beat D-53995 over the head with the Bible for several seconds before pointing its finger at her in an accusatory manner. | Corresponds to lyrics in which the singer urges unnamed persons to “confess” to an unspecified action.  
0:55-1:50 | As the chorus and guitar solo begin, SCP-6035-B discards its Bible and an electric guitar appears in its hands. SCP-6035-A and SCP-6035-B then vocalize the chorus before reproducing the guitar solo from the song. | Chorus, guitar solo.  
1:51-2:00 | SCP-6035-A and SCP-6035-B appear on either side of D-53995 and grab her shoulders while pointing around the testing chamber in an agitated manner. | Corresponds to lyrics identical to the verse from 0:10-0:20, but with an unspecified “room” referenced in place of a country.  
2:01-2:37 | SCP-6035-A and SCP-6035-B vocalize the chorus and play the instrumental that concludes the song. Following the end of the track, they both take a short bow and immediately de-manifest before the next song (_Mystery_) plays. | Chorus, closing instrumental.  
**Addendum 6035.A: Accidental Neutralization of SCP-6035:** On 22 Oct 2019, SCP-6035 was accidentally neutralized during regular testing.
Following the conclusion of a standard test, researchers instructed the test subject (D-46924) to remove SCP-6035 from the testing turntable and immediately replace it with a non-anomalous vinyl of _Eight Songs for Greg Sage and The Wipers_ , a 1992 tribute album consisting of covers of various Wipers songs. Following the conclusion of the third song on the album, a cover of _Return of the Rat_ by the grunge band Nirvana, SCP-6035-A and SCP-6035-B[1](javascript:;) manifested in the testing chamber. One was wearing a Nirvana-themed shirt and the other a shirt which mimicked the cover art for _Is This Real?_ Both entities then made loud screeching vocalizations at one another in an apparently argumentative manner for the next five minutes.
At the conclusion of the argument, the SCP-6035-A/B instance wearing the Nirvana shirt picked up SCP-6035 and threw it against the testing chamber wall. Both instances then slowly walked towards the opposite end of the testing chamber before de-manifesting. Following this event, SCP-6035 displayed no anomalous properties in its subsequent activations; SCP-6035-A and SCP-6035-B have not appeared since the aforementioned test. SCP-6035 has been reclassified as Neutralized.
