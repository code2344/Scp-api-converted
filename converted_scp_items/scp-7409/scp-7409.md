SCP-7409. Close-up captured by _Phoenix_.
**Item #:** SCP-7409
**Object Class:** Safe
**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7409 is to remain in its location of discovery. Due to the remoteness of this location, further containment is unnecessary.
**Description:** SCP-7409 is a single white lily _(lilium candidum)_.
SCP-7409 bears visual resemblance to domesticated _lilium candidum_ found on Earth; however, the object is located approximately 700 million light years from Earth. This location is notable for being at the approximate center of the Bo√∂tes Void[1](javascript:;).
SCP-7409 was discovered during a routine patrol of its surrounding area by unmanned Foundation drone _Phoenix_. Once _Phoenix_ encountered SCP-7409, it switched itself to manual control mode and awaited further instructions from ground control. Upon seeing the object, ground control noted a desire to "leave it alone", which they identified as a minor compulsion effect. Despite this, the team instructed _Phoenix_ to attempt to retrieve a sample of SCP-7409.
When the drone came within 1 kilometer from SCP-7409, its propulsion jets abruptly lost power. _Phoenix_ 's momentum was still able to carry it to the object. However, the drone was unable to collect it or retrieve samples from it; indeed, SCP-7409 appeared to have been "anchored" to its location by an undetectable force. _Phoenix_ 's jets returned to normal functionality after photos of the object were taken, and ground control directed it back towards its routine patrol.
The area surrounding SCP-7409 contains several large clouds of small particles, later identified as _lilium candidum_ pollen. The volume of these clouds is consistent with 16.2 billion years of pollen production.
