Special Containment Procedures:

 Research into means of neutralising SCP-6600 or repositioning Reality ♮-1 is underway. All resources that are used for non-essential projects should be rerouted to prevent the eventual collapse of Reality ♮-1. Containment efforts are to focus on mitigation of adverse effects on reality.

At this time, efforts to protect the Veil are still in place. Governments and NGOs affiliated with the Foundation have been tasked with management of civilian unrest. Concealment of the effects of SCP-6600 is impossible; civilians will be informed of reality deviations incited by SCP-6600 for safety purposes. However, they will not be told the cause.

Description:

 SCP-6600 is the catalyst of the rapid deterioration of universal stability in the Multiversal Web

. The effects of SCP-6600 causes the dissolution of Ways

 connecting universes, eventually severing them from the Multiversal Web. The nature and source of SCP-6600 are unknown.

The structure of the Multiversal Web denotes that each universe is bound to two or more Ways. Ways entering a universe branch into a root-like structure that extends through subspace; they possess a non-Euclidean interior allowing entry from many locations within the Multiversal Web, permitting rapid travel within the universe and other universes.

Due to SCP-6600, the Ways extending from Reality ♮-1

3

 have become highly unstable. Attempted exploration of the Ways by formic exploratory teams has resulted in near-immediate expiry of drones as a result of incompatible laws of physics, even while wearing protective SRT

4

 garments. Other realities

5

 are also subject to the effects of SCP-6600.

As a result of SCP-6600, Reality ♮-1 has been experiencing minor shifts in reality, which increase in frequency. These phenomena include, but are not limited to:

Objects and spiders changing in colour;

Objects and spiders shifting in space unpredictably;

Objects disappearing or reappearing without warning, sometimes resulting in objects merging;

Localised temporal distortions, causing time to move quicker or slower;

Minor visual anomalies in and around surfaces, resulting in multiple copies of an object overlapping one another.

SCP-6600 also causes cognitive degradation. Symptoms include:

Memory loss;

Loss of consciousness;

Changes in personality;

Loss of brain function;

Loss of bodily autonomy;

Agitation, confusion, and aggressive compulsions.

The widespread appearance of these anomalies has caused panic in the general populace, inciting riots and looting. International and governmental agencies have reduced the severity with varying degrees of success. Preventing panic is an objective, but not the Foundation's main concern at this time.

05 Briefing on SCP-6600 Video Log Transcript

Director Celeste:

 As you know, we have recently found out that our universe and reality are not the only ones out there. In addition, we have also discovered the shifts in reality are being caused by the deterioration of our reality, or as we know it, SCP-6600. It is theorized that we will be completely separated from the Multiversal Web in at least eight years.

Researcher Lime:

 Eight years is… a short time.

Director Celeste:

 It is. So, I am suggesting that Site-67 become the safe site and main research centre for SCP-6600. We are certain that preventative measures are required.

O5-4:

 Site-67 is currently a lunar protection site, no?

Director Celeste:

 Currently, yes. However, if the Council agrees, I would like to renovate the Site into something more purposeful. As it stands, we own twenty-six lunar protection sites globally. That seems like overkill.

O5-7:

 How much do you think it will cost?

Director Celeste:

 Around 60,000 SB, but that’s the maximum.

O5-4:

 What documentation do we have so far on SCP-6600? While it does present a threat to the Veil, it does not seem detrimental.

[Director Celeste gestures to Researcher Lime.]

Researcher Lime:

 My team has run the numbers and there really isn’t any knowing what will happen when we separate from the Multiversal Web, however, it is likely that we will suffer consequences.

Director Celeste:

 With this being known, I highly recommend you sign off on this.

O5-1:

 We will discuss it. I'll be in touch.

 Renovation of Site-67

We’ve decided to permit the renovation of Site-67 to a specialized site for the containment of SCP-6600. We expect budget reports.

 Renovation of Site-67 — Complete(ish)

Date:

 9/13/30

Hello, everyone.

I hope you're all doing well after these hellish 4 months, but we’re back in business!

An acceptable amount of renovations have been completed on Site-67. I would like researchers to transfer back to our home Site and continue research. Many have brought to me the idea of reality anchors to protect against the ever-growing effects of SCP-6600. While the mass unrest has been mostly quelled, I would like field agents to prepare for the worst when going on missions.

In the meantime, keep up the good work.

 Situation Of Things

Hello hello!

So, as many of you know that things have been getting worse, panic in the general populace is rising and the Veil is partially broken. This is not to say we should give them more information. In fact, I suggest we keep all of it under Veil part two. With this I want field agents to avoid all major cities unless absolutely necessary. I feel for you and your families, especially those who are not informed.

On another note, we’ve found out that Scranton Reality Anchors are slightly effective against SCP-6600’s effects. We are still looking for a way to concentrate the effects of these anchors. If the theories are right, it will preserve normalcy, at least what we have left. If anything, it should reverse the current effects, and keep us tethered to The Multiversal Web.

Keep up the good work.

Recorded tests on Reality Anchors and other preserving technology; these tests were held to determine the effectiveness in decreasing the severity of SCP-6600's effects.

Hello!

The majority of testing on our reality anchoring and shielding has concluded, and while the effects of SCP-6600 are still present within our Site, it should be more than manageable. Unfortunately, the estimated time to finish implementing the Aeolian (VI) on site is about 2 years. With that information, testing on The Multiversal Webbing may be challenging, but I have faith that all of you will make great strides in preserving our reality.

New assignments and positions will be coming to all of you soon. I’m sure we can do this.

Don’t give up hope!

AUDIO LOG TRANSCRIPT

DATE:

 8/8/2034

NOTE:

 The following is a transcript of a broadcast focused on general morale boost.

<Begin Log>

Hello!

So, I want to start this “update” by congratulating the great work done by the renovation and reality defending team, as their effort on the reality anchors and reality shields have proven successful in protecting the Site against the current state of our universe.

Three years ago we started this venture, and while we may have been successful in some aspects, we’ve only managed to protect this one Site. With that, many researchers have brought up the concern that this solution is not viable in both the short and long term, as our situation is always changing. This may also not work well for broad general public use. Thus, I would like us to move away from focusing on reality shields and anchors for protecting Reality ♮-1 as a whole, instead of having them for the SCP Foundation and our major Sites.

In the meantime, I would like our field agents to continue their work in identifying the effects of SCP-6600 on the general public and Earth itself. Researchers should continue their work on protecting Reality ♮-1, with a group working on the enhanced reality shields and anchors but a majority will be working on a longer-term and more stable solution to SCP-6600.

Celeste, out.

AUDIO LOG TRANSCRIPT

DATE:

 1/23/2035

NOTE:

 The following is a transcript of the first broadcast to the entirety of the SCP Foundation.

<Begin Log>

All of you have seen the most recent memo from the higher-ups. Researchers predicted six years ago that we would have eight years until the complete collapse of Reality ♮-1. Well, in the last month Reality ♮-1 is almost completely detached from the Multiversal Web. It’s unknown when we will be cut off, but we’re sure it’s soon. For the rest of the Foundation, we apologize. We've failed. If you’re capable of leaving your Site, please do. Come to Site-67 and prepare for the worst. If you’re able to put forward your efforts and resources to help, please do. I know it’s a lot to ask, that you abandon your friends and family, but there is hope.

If you are not able or willing to help, and if you notice any of these effects, evacuate the area:

Tears in surfaces such as walls, the ground, sky, or any other area.

Popping or snapping sounds from seemingly nowhere.

Seeing yourself, or loved ones both within the static and on the streets. 

Note:

 Do not interact with them. It is unknown at this time if they are violent.

Extreme brain fog, and other psychological effects, including depression and memory loss.

Chills.

Changes in vision and other sensory perception.

Any other changes to reality.

The Veil may be broken, but our hope is not. Please come to Site-67 if you’re able to. There is always a need for more legs.

Thank you and stay well.

Director Celeste.
