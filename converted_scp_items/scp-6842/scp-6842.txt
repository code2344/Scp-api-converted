Special Containment Procedures:

 SCP-6842 is currently in the care of Agent Klein of MTF-Omicron-1 (“Tactical Penetration”). Further containment procedures were deemed unnecessary after positive behavioral changes were noted as a result of working with MTF-Omicron-1. Periodic monitoring on a yearly basis of the extent of and potential changes in SCP-6842's anomalous effects should be conducted to ensure classification remains appropriate. These assessments are to be performed at Biological Containment Site-63.

Description:

 SCP-6842 is currently (as of 18-4-2019) a Red Merle pattern Border Collie in the care of Agent Klein of MTF-Omicron-1. SCP-6842 was procured by the Foundation on 27-01-1942 and has undergone multiple metamorphosis since this time. When DNA testing became available both pre-metamorphosis and post-metamorphosis DNA samples of SCP-6842 showed no significant discrepancies, suggesting SCP-6842 remains the same entity.

SCP-6842’s anomalous feature occurs at any point it would be expected to die. When brain death occurs in SCP-6842 it spontaneously combusts. Once SCP-6842’s body is fully consumed its phenotypic and morphological features will reconstruct into a different breed of 

Canis lupus familiaris

1

 and general bodily function will resume.

SCP-6842 has attempted to escape containment multiple times and has been noted to metamorphose into breeds whose attributes are advantageous to these attempts. Behavioral changes are reported on in provided test logs. Non-relevant test logs have been left out of the official database entry, but can be made available upon request.

Note 23-07-1963:

All further testing on SCP-6842’s anomalous effects is prohibited, by order of The Ethics Committee.

SCP-6842 was discovered in 1942 as an Ambulance Dog

2

 working for the British army. The Foundation located SCP-6842 after rumours surfaced of an “immortal Dog” surface within the Unit it was recovered from. At the time of initial containment SCP-6842 had the appearance of a Lurcher

3

. SCP-6842 is believed to be a byproduct of the 7th Occult war, possibly being the result of anomalous experiments performed by the British government.

Tests with SCP-6842 revealed its anomalous traits and after multiple different tests SCP-6842 was officially given a Euclid classification due to its hostility towards researchers and multiple attempted escapes.

Note 12-08-1953:

Since SCP-6842 was assigned to MTF-Omicron-1, its behaviour has undergone major changes, including a decrease in aggression and an increase in obedience. Following this, its classification was changed from Euclid to Safe. See supplied mission report from MTF-Omicron-1 for a more detailed log of these behavioral changes.

Breed after termination

Bernese Mountain Dog

Termination Method

Subcutaneous Lethal injection(Pentobarbital dosage: 100mg/kg)

Results

SCP-6842 was injected subcutaneously with pentobarbital at a dosage of 100mg/kg of body weight. After approximately 25 minutes, during which SCP-6842 emitted sounds of distress, the same combustion as observed in previous tests took place. After metamorphosis Once SCP-6842 could move it pounced off of the medical table and snapped at any staff close to it biting Dr. S.C. Riemann in the process.

Behavior

Prior to testing, while transporting SCP-6842 to the testing room, SCP-6842 snapped at the research assistants tasked to transport it.

After testing SCP-6842 broke free from the restraints keeping it tied to the table, attacking and biting Dr. Riemann when it managed to break free.

Note

Dr. Riemann was cleared by onsite medical staff and suffered no long term adverse results from the bite.

 

Note:

Further testing on SCP-6842 will focus on attempts to influence its post-metamorphosis breed; initial tests will operate on the assumption that cause of death is a leading factor in breed ‘selection’. Due to SCP-6842’s increase in aggression, one armed personnel member should be present during all testing, to ensure staff safety.

Termination Method

Drowning

Results

SCP-6842 has regenerated into a Whippet while, taking the cause of death into account, the expected breed after metamorphosis was a german shepherd. This development gives reason to suspect that, while linked, the cause of death is not the only variable determining the breed after metamorphosis. Further testing will be required.

Behavior

While preparations were being made for testing SCP-6842 showed aggression and, when taken out of containment, violent hostility.

Post-metamorphosis SCP-6842 escaped as one staff member opened the door to the testing room. SCP-6842 had to be tranquilized to ensure recontainment.

Subcutaneous Lethal injection (Pentobarbital dosage: 100mg/kg)

Results

SCP-6842 was injected with Pentobarbital at a dosage of 100mg/kg body weight. After approximately 35 minutes, during which SCP-6842 emitted sounds of distress on a near continuous basis, the combustion reaction took place as normal. The post-metamorphosis breed of SCP-6842 was again, not in line with expectations set by previous tests. While the leading theory is still that the specific death has an effect on the outcome of the change of breed, more resources will be used to find the exact link to maximize the use of this feature.

Behavior

SCP-6842 showed initial hostility when personnel entered the testing room with the supplies needed for the injection. It attempted to attack personnel when the injection was to be administered.

Post-metamorphosis SCP-6842 ran around the room attempting to find a means of escape. SCP-6842 was transported back to its containment cage when it had expended all of its energy.

Shooting (Center mass)

Results

SCP-6842 got shot during an escape attempt. SCP-6842 broke loose from personnel transporting it to a testing chamber. SCP-6842 was incapacitated by a shot, fired by Security personnel, that hit center mass. The expected combustion happened approximately 15 minutes later. The escape attempt was classified as malicious.

Behavior

SCP-6842 was not outwardly aggressive when retrieved from containment. When leaving containment SCP-6842 was on a leash and, quickly after leaving the room its cage was in, quickly ripped the leash away from the research assistants and ran away.

SCP-6842, after being shot and its metamorphosis, attempted to harm security staff. It showed aggression and attempted to bite any staff that came close. SCP-6842 was tranquilized to aid in re-containment.

IV administration of PentoBarbital (Dosage: 150mg/kg)

Results

Pentobarbital was administered at a Dosage of 150mg/kg body weight of SCP-6842. SCP-6842 was restrained on a medical table and was given an IV line, through which the Pentobarbital solution was to be administered. SCP-6842 did not express any sounds of distress at this time, the expected combustion happened ten minutes after administration.

Behavior

SCP-6842 showed slight aversion to personnel that got it from containment, but stopped being aggressive and trying to escape the situation.

SCP-6842, directly post-metamorphosis, escaped the restraints it was in on the medical table. SCP-6842 attempted to attack multiple research personnel who were in the room. SCP-6842 had to be sedated to ensure being brought back to containment safely.

Integration and Use of SCP-6842

Dear Dr. Andersson

 

We would like to inform you on the progress SCP-6842 has made in our training and integration regime, and its participation in its first official mission.

During training, SCP-6842 has shown great promise due to its prior training as an ambulance dog during the war. It was quickly noted to be much less aggressive and prone to escape around personnel not previously involved in testing.

During its first official mission, SCP-6842 showed great progress and great work in general. Examples of this include, but are not limited to: Alerting agents of approaching patrols, providing safety for our agents and even on navigation. It showed major benefit to the mission itself, as seen in the official safety report submitted.

We formally request that we be notified of any further testing at least two months in advance, and reserve the right to deny any testing due to possible mission interference. Due to possible confidentiality issues, we also reserve the right not to give a full justification for denial of testing.

We thank you for your cooperation in this matter and wish for your continued cooperation in future endeavors. SCP-6842 is now in the permanent care of MTF-Omicron-1.

Regards,

 

MTF-Omicron-1 Task Force command

NOTICE FROM MTF-OMICRON-1 TO SCP-6842 RESEARCH TEAM

We write to inform you that SCP-6842 has passed in the evening of 02-05-1963. Due to the deteriorating health of SCP-6842 we chose euthanasia as the most humane option as it would regenerate afterwards into a healthy state again. Its anomalous ability triggered as expected and it’s now an Icelandic Sheepdog.

— MTF-Omicron-1 Task force command

 

Note:

 03-05-1963

The team researching SCP-6842 has been notified by MTF-Omicron-1 that SCP-6842 had died of natural causes. Its anomalous trait still took effect, the new breed of SCP-6842 being an Icelandic sheepdog. This seemingly points to SCP-6842 living normally around the same amount of time as the breed it takes on after regeneration.

NOTICE FROM THE FOUNDATION ETHICS COMMITTEE

Date: 23-07-1963

All further testing involving the termination, attempted termination, or purposeful harm directed towards SCP-6842 is heretofore prohibited. The current caretakers of SCP-6842, MTF-Omicron-1, have reported that SCP-6842 experiences pain on the same level as a non-anomalous animal. Additionally, this committee notes that testing on SCP-6842 has yet to provide any significant benefit or scientific insight. A full review of SCP-6842’s test logs is being conducted to determine any wrongdoing on the part of the research team or Site Administration.

 

Notice of Dismissal of Dr.Riemann

Following the investigation of test logs regarding SCP-6842, the Ethics Committee has concluded that Dr. Riemann neglected to request permission for further testing from the Ethics Committee when it became evident that SCP-6842 was capable of experiencing pain and further neglected to report to Site Command that ‘Termination tests’ were not providing any significant or relevant data.

In light of these discoveries, Dr. Riemann has been found guilty of gross negligence in his post as lead researcher for the SCP-6842 research team and has therefore been dismissed. Further penalties will be enforced by the Ethics committee.

Effective as of: 01-08-1963

We would like to welcome you as the new lead researcher for SCP-6842. We hope to have a better experience with you than with Dr. Riemann.

Any proposal for testing relating to SCP-6842 should be sent to us with at least two months' notice so we can decide whether we take SCP-6842 in for testing or not. Given the nature of our Task Force we do not need to provide any reason to deny testing.

We hope you keep the circumstances of Dr. Riemann’s removal off the SCP-6842 case in mind.

 DNA Testing of SCP-6842

Dear Sir/Madam,

 

I would hereby like to inform you that I have put in an application for DNA testing of SCP-6842, scheduled for 28-11-1986.

 

We will be testing some older samples of SCP-6842 that we have in storage. However, we need some material for comparison and will therefore need some new DNA material of SCP-6842. This will consist of some hair, saliva and blood samples.

 

This can be done at BCS-63, and after acquiring the necessary samples, SCP-6842 can immediately be released back into your care. The process should not be more painful or uncomfortable than a normal veterinary visit and should last approximately 30 minutes.

 

If any more questions arise feel free to contact me.

DNA Testing

28-11-1986

Presiding researcher

Dr. E.C. Langdon

Current Breed

Boston Terrier

Samples used

Sample Set 1 (Jack Russel Terrier): Hair, blood and saliva samples taken on intake and kept in cryo storage. Taken on 08-04-1942.

Sample Set 2 (Boston Terrier): Hair, blood and saliva samples taken on 28-11-1986

Hypothesis

Comparison between samples from 1946 and 1986 will show that SCP-6842 is the same being as during intake, bar for slight variation due to differing breed.

Results

Hypothesis was proven both right and wrong. The DNA profile of SCP-6842 showed the exact same composition in both DNA samples. It did not change depending on breed either. It didn’t show any variation in the composition of its DNA compared to 40 years prior.

 

Note:

 24-05-1993

Late during the night of 23-05-1993 I was notified of the passing of SCP-6842 of natural causes around 15 years after the last regeneration. The breed of SCP-6842 after regeneration was confirmed to be a Jack Russel Terrier. No direct correlation between breeds has been found yet when SCP-6842 has died of natural causes.

-Dr. E.C. Langdon

 

Note:

 27-08-2005

In the Early morning of 27-08-2005 I was notified of the passing of SCP-6842 again by natural causes. The new breed of SCP-6842 is a Golden retriever. Still no direct correlation was found between the death of the SCP-6842 and the breed it becomes after death. This should be seen as an indication that the initial theory that the breed can be manipulated is untrue.

Dear Dr Sanders,

 

I would like to formally congratulate you on your assignment to take over ‘research’ on SCP-6842.

 

It’s classed as a small extra task for a reason, because it is. The main thing that has happened over the years I led SCP-6842 research is a single physical test. The main thing you will do while assigned to this case is logging natural passings of SCP-6842. I recommend you keep it this way.

 

You will likely soon be contacted by MTF-Omicron-1 Task Force command in regards to SCP-6842. They’re quite intense, but they only have the best intentions regarding the care of SCP-6842 in mind. You may want to read up on what happened before I took over the research.

 

Good luck with your new assignment.

Note:

 26-01-2019

In the afternoon of 26-01-2019 A message from MTF-Omicron-1 was received about SCP-6842 stating that it had passed again and has regenerated into a Border Collie. On examination it specifically is a Red Merle pattern border collie. Noted is that any initial hostility it used to show towards research staff has been negated over the years of training and SCP-6842 should no longer be considered hostile in any form.

Report on the integration of SCP-6842 into MTF-Omicron-1

 

Integration report of training with SCP-6842 from 05-07-1951 through 05-10-1951

Integration Goal

Training SCP-6842 to act as a working dog for specific use in MTF-Omicron-1 including but not limited to: Ensuring safety for our agents, alerting agents to incoming patrols and possibly navigation. Counteracting aggressive behaviors and reduce flight risk from SCP-6842.

Presiding Agent(s)

Agent Klein.

Current Breed of SCP-6842

Australian Koolie

Summary

On request by operators within MTF-Omicron-1 near its inception their request for a working dog was granted. SCP-6842 was chosen as it already had a basic training as a working dog with its Mercy Dog history during WWII. SCP-6842 took quickly to its training and its new handler and showed next to no aggressive or tendencies to try to escape that were noted when SCP-6842 was turned over to MTF care. After a month in training SCP-6842 was cleared to be a working dog.

SCP-6842 was procured by MTF-Omicron-1 on 05-07-1951 while integration was supposed to start on 05-09-1951. This choice was made by Agent Klein as the current breed of SCP-6842 was deemed beneficial to its training and integration and a new termination would not guarantee a beneficial breed of dog.

SCP-6842 seemingly still had some ingrained access to the training it had had for its duties during WWII. Being able to follow the same commands that were generally used during the war. This was beneficial as it cut down on the basic training time of SCP-6842. This only required the agents of MTF-Omicron-1 to learn the proper commands to use.

SCP-6842 showed some behaviors that needed to be corrected before it could officially be used. These were its tendencies to anger towards science personnel within the Foundation. Agent Klein noted this to likely be due to it only getting harmed when scientific personnel were involved. Corrections were made by positive exposure by bringing SCP-6842 around scientific personnel in positive situations. These behaviors were corrected for general scientific personnel after around a month. The behavior was not corrected for specific personnel like Dr. Riemann, but keeping SCP-6842 away from certain personnel was deemed a viable option.

Training also involved alerting to personnel that are not part of MTF-Omicron-1 when on alert as a way to avoid patrols. This effect was achieved by having SCP-6842 familiarize itself with the smells of the members of MTF-Omicron-1 and teaching it to alert when someone that wasn’t one of them came from out of sight. This would be used for situations like patrols coming around corners.

Training and integration was officially concluded on 05-10-1951 after the successful conclusion of the penetration test scheduled on that date.

Contents of report

The contents of the following report are an abbreviated version of the full mission report. The full mission report is still highly classified due to the nature of it dealing with security within the Foundation and specifically Armed Containment Area ██. The purpose of this document is to show the use of SCP-6842 during a mission.

At 07:20 first entrance was made into ACA-██ under the guise of being part of MTF-Nu-7 “Hammer Down”. The uniforms of the agents Klein, Burke, Chance, and Walters were made to resemble accurate replications of MTF-Nu-7 uniforms. Noted by Agent Klein is that with SCP-6842 around less people questioned their legitimacy as people were hesitant to get into the way of a working dog.

Around 8:00 Agents Klein and Burke split off from the group. Where Chance and Walters went on directly to the barracks, Agents Klein and Burke saw opportunity with SCP-6842 in tow to explore more of the facility and at the same time find flaws in security patrols and possible other entry points.

Around 8:30 Agents Klein and Burke found an unsecured door on the side of the facility marked on the supplied facility map. (Map not supplied in declassified information.)

Around 9:00 SCP-6842 led agents Klein and Burke around corridors to behind a security checkpoint. Avoiding patrols and an actual security checkpoint by avoiding the smells of other people.

Agents Klein and Burke reached the barracks of onsite security personnel around 9:20. They opted to cross this off their list as the door to the security barracks was well secured going on to find the armory.

Around 9:30 the onsite Armory was located and noted to be unsecured by the virtue of patrols not crossing over near the armory itself. The armory lock was simple and noted to be easily opened with a simple direct attack.

Around 10:00 Agents Klein and Burke met back up with Agents Walters and Chance at the Nu-7 barracks. Neither duo was questioned on their legitimacy while inside.

While on the way back out of ACA-██ SCP-6842 alerted to people, other than the agents of MTF-Omicron-1, coming from out of sight allowing the agents to diverge their route out of the facility. This by chance revealed another less secured route leading to an eventual extra exit to the outside.

Going outside onto the ground of ACA-██ led to an easy return to the vehicles they arrived with. No security clearance proof was taken into the ACA at the onset of the mission.

All discoveries made in this Physical penetration mission have been presented to Site-director ██████ to ensure ease of adjustments to secure ACA-██ better in the future.

Any of the specific security flaws mentioned in this report have already been fixed and tested again to be sure of the improvement of onsite security
