An instance of SCP-6534-1.

Special Containment Procedures:

 SCP-6534 is to be contained in a standard humanoid chamber in Site-56.

Instances of SCP-6534-1 are to be contained in Site-56's Anomalous Media Archive. Mobile Task Force Beta-14 ("Format Wars") is responsible for locating and seizing instances of SCP-6534-1 in civilian possession, and administering amnestics when necessary.

Description:

 SCP-6534 is a 24 year old human female with the given name "Carmen Brown".

SCP-6534 possesses the ability to digitally manipulate the contents of Video Home System (VHS) cassettes through undetermined means. Cassettes modified through this matter are designated SCP-6534-1. The nature and duration of each modification made are determined by SCP-6534's personal choices.

Addendum:

 In July 2005, civilians in the southwestern United States began complaining of "tampered VHS tapes" that had been delivered through the United Parcel Service (UPS). Mobile Task Force Beta-14 was dispatched to investigate the phenomenon and confiscate tampered cassettes.

Transcript 6534-1

Interviewer:

 Researcher Victoria Vomac

Interviewed:

 SCP-6534

Date:

 July 27, 2005

<Begin Log>

Researcher Vomac and SCP-6534 are seated opposite each other in the interrogation room. There is a television set and a VHS player located behind Vomac.

Vomac:

 Could you state your name for the record, please?

SCP-6534:

 It's Carmen.

Silence.

Vomac:

 Carmen 

what?

SCP-6534:

 …Oscella Brown?

Vomac:

 Ms. Brown, I've had you brought here so I could learn more about your videotape manipulation abilities. How does it work?

SCP-6534:

 Am I under arrest?

Vomac:

 Technically… no. How does your ability work?

SCP-6534:

 I wanna talk to a lawyer.

Vomac:

 You need to- look, you're not being accused of a crime, so you don't need an attorney.

SCP-6534:

 Then why did they cuff me at the-

Vomac:

 Ms. Brown, if you answer every single one of my questions truthfully, I will let you leave. But until then, you'll have to stay here. Do you understand?

SCP-6534 takes a deep breath and nods its head "yes". Researcher Vomac takes a deep breath in return.

Vomac:

 Okay, question one: Do you have an ability to manipulate the content of VHS tapes in any way?

SCP-6534 nods its head "yes".

Vomac:

 Question two: How does this ability work? Is there a spell you need to chant? Or a demonic pact?

SCP-6534:

 Uh… no?

Silence.

Vomac:

 So what is the method that you use, exactly?

SCP-6534:

 I… really don't know how to explain it accurately…

Vomac:

 How are you unable to- you've done it dozens of times, we've found over fifty tampered tapes. At this point, you'd have a good grasp on the process, no?

SCP-6534 does not respond. Researcher Vomac lets out a sigh.

Vomac:

 You know, I'm starting to suspect you don't have such an ability after all. That's why you're staying silent about your method, there 

isn't

 one.

SCP-6534 does not respond. Researcher Vomac grabs a VHS cassette in a bag under the table and hands it to SCP-6534.

Vomac:

 You can't do anything with this, can you?

SCP-6534:

 Wha- yes I can!

Vomac:

 Prove it.

SCP-6534 grips the cassette with its left hand and closes its eyes. It begins to smile and giggle to itself.

Twenty seconds pass. SCP-6534 opens its eyes and hands the cassette back to Researcher Vomac.

SCP-6534:

 Done. Why don't you watch it right now?

Researcher Vomac turns towards the TV and VHS player behind her.

Vomac:

 One step ahead of you.

The cassette is inserted into the player; playback begins.

A calm lake is visible on-screen.

Vomac:

 What did you add, exactly?

SCP-6534:

 

<giggles>

 Oh, just a… little yellow duck.

Researcher Vomac observes the screen.

Vomac:

 Lies. There's no duck.

SCP-6534:

 I made her a little small… 

<giggles>

 you'll just have to look closer.

Researcher Vomac leans in closer at the picture.

Vomac:

 Why would you even make it so small if you're trying to prove that-

A loud shriek is heard as a black-and-white image of a deformed face appears on the screen.

Vomac:

 Oh, mother 

fucking

 God!

SCP-6534 begins to laugh harder. Researcher Vomac coughs and gags, regains her composure and turns back to look at the former.

Vomac:

 You- you little brat!

SCP-6534 points at the screen.

SCP-6534:

 I told you, there's a duck.

Vomac:

 I'm not falling for that again!

SCP-6534:

 

<calming down>

 I'm legit this time, there's a duck. I added it, as I promised.

Reseacher Vomac groans and looks back at the screen in an apprehensive manner. The screaming noise has died down.

Vomac:

 Hey wait a minute, there 

is

 a du-

A loud distorted quack is heard as a shadowy image of a duck appears on-screen.

Vomac:

 Aw, motherfucker!

SCP-6534 begins to laugh uncontrollably.
