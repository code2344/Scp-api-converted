An instance of SCP-6534-1.
**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-6534 is to be contained in a standard humanoid chamber in Site-56.
Instances of SCP-6534-1 are to be contained in Site-56's Anomalous Media Archive. Mobile Task Force Beta-14 ("Format Wars") is responsible for locating and seizing instances of SCP-6534-1 in civilian possession, and administering amnestics when necessary.

SCP-6534 possesses the ability to digitally manipulate the contents of Video Home System (VHS) cassettes through undetermined means. Cassettes modified through this matter are designated SCP-6534-1. The nature and duration of each modification made are determined by SCP-6534's personal choices.

**Addendum:** In July 2005, civilians in the southwestern United States began complaining of "tampered VHS tapes" that had been delivered through the United Parcel Service (UPS). Mobile Task Force Beta-14 was dispatched to investigate the phenomenon and confiscate tampered cassettes.

_Researcher Vomac and SCP-6534 are seated opposite each other in the interrogation room. There is a television set and a VHS player located behind Vomac._
**Vomac:** Could you state your name for the record, please?
**SCP-6534:** It's Carmen.
_Silence._
**Vomac:** Carmen _what?_
**SCP-6534:** …Oscella Brown?
**Vomac:** Ms. Brown, I've had you brought here so I could learn more about your videotape manipulation abilities. How does it work?
**SCP-6534:** Am I under arrest?
**Vomac:** Technically… no. How does your ability work?
**SCP-6534:** I wanna talk to a lawyer.
**Vomac:** You need to- look, you're not being accused of a crime, so you don't need an attorney.
**SCP-6534:** Then why did they cuff me at the-
**Vomac:** Ms. Brown, if you answer every single one of my questions truthfully, I will let you leave. But until then, you'll have to stay here. Do you understand?
_SCP-6534 takes a deep breath and nods its head "yes". Researcher Vomac takes a deep breath in return._
**Vomac:** Okay, question one: Do you have an ability to manipulate the content of VHS tapes in any way?
_SCP-6534 nods its head "yes"._
**Vomac:** Question two: How does this ability work? Is there a spell you need to chant? Or a demonic pact?
**SCP-6534:** Uh… no?
_Silence._
**Vomac:** So what is the method that you use, exactly?
**SCP-6534:** I… really don't know how to explain it accurately…
**Vomac:** How are you unable to- you've done it dozens of times, we've found over fifty tampered tapes. At this point, you'd have a good grasp on the process, no?
_SCP-6534 does not respond. Researcher Vomac lets out a sigh._
**Vomac:** You know, I'm starting to suspect you don't have such an ability after all. That's why you're staying silent about your method, there _isn't_ one.
_SCP-6534 does not respond. Researcher Vomac grabs a VHS cassette in a bag under the table and hands it to SCP-6534._
**Vomac:** You can't do anything with this, can you?
**SCP-6534:** Wha- yes I can!
**Vomac:** Prove it.
_SCP-6534 grips the cassette with its left hand and closes its eyes. It begins to smile and giggle to itself._
_Twenty seconds pass. SCP-6534 opens its eyes and hands the cassette back to Researcher Vomac._
**SCP-6534:** Done. Why don't you watch it right now?
_Researcher Vomac turns towards the TV and VHS player behind her._
**Vomac:** One step ahead of you.
_The cassette is inserted into the player; playback begins._
_A calm lake is visible on-screen._
**Vomac:** What did you add, exactly?
**SCP-6534:** _< giggles>_ Oh, just a… little yellow duck.
_Researcher Vomac observes the screen._
**Vomac:** Lies. There's no duck.
**SCP-6534:** I made her a little small… _< giggles>_ you'll just have to look closer.
_Researcher Vomac leans in closer at the picture._
**Vomac:** Why would you even make it so small if you're trying to prove that-

_A loud shriek is heard as a black-and-white image of a deformed face appears on the screen._
**Vomac:** Oh, mother _fucking_ God!
_SCP-6534 begins to laugh harder. Researcher Vomac coughs and gags, regains her composure and turns back to look at the former._
**Vomac:** You- you little brat!
_SCP-6534 points at the screen._
**SCP-6534:** I told you, there's a duck.
**Vomac:** I'm not falling for that again!
**SCP-6534:** _< calming down>_ I'm legit this time, there's a duck. I added it, as I promised.
_Reseacher Vomac groans and looks back at the screen in an apprehensive manner. The screaming noise has died down._
**Vomac:** Hey wait a minute, there _is_ a du-

_A loud distorted quack is heard as a shadowy image of a duck appears on-screen._
**Vomac:** Aw, motherfucker!
_SCP-6534 begins to laugh uncontrollably._
