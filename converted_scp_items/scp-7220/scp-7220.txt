Special Containment Procedures:

 SCP-7220 is contained in a standard human containment cell in 

Site-126

. Foundation staff are permitted interviews with SCP-7220 at the discretion of Site Director Grey.

Description:

 SCP-7220 is suspected to be the last living human. Although rumors indicate that other humans may exist in other small civilizations around the globe, SCP-7220 is the only instance that has been conclusively proven by Foundation scientists to be fully human.

SCP-7220 was discovered at 3340706504 seconds in the Site-126 break room. Research Unit-824 was attempting to access an old-world recreational activity, when it produced the following evidence that it was a human.

Following this revelation, Research Unit-824 was reclassified as SCP-7220 and contained for further testing. SCP-7220 proved capable of identifying several mishappen letters, successfully failing a game of chess, and declaring [INFOHAZARD REMOVED] to be false.

With the last living human in containment, Site Director Grey issued orders to all Units to override Foundation remnant protocols and focus efforts on reconstructing the Capitol city above Site-126.

Welcome, Site Director Grey

Site Director Grey enters a small suburban home outside Site-126. They enter and sit on the couch across from an unknown entity formed of nightmares and death.

Grey:

 Hello old friend. It's been a while.

Entity:

 You mortals have such a weird perception of time.

Grey:

 I'm immortal too now. I'm a lich, we're on the same level.

Entity:

 No, we're not.

The room darkens and howling screams echo from far away.

Grey:

 Fine, be that way. I thought we could be friends or something, since we did save the world together that one time.

Entity:

 Save the world? I don't want to save the world, I want to end it! …. Just not right now, I've got other things going on.

Grey:

 Of course. On to the real reason I'm here, I need to ask a favour of you.

Entity:

 Do I get your soul in return?

Grey:

 I don't have one of those-

Entity:

 No deal!

The Entity stands on its uncountable legs and leaves the room. Shortly after, a man wrapped in bandages sits enters the room.

Bernie:

 Hey, what was all that about? I heard screaming.

Grey:

 Oh, just our mutual friend being difficult again. Speaking of which, I need to ask you something.

Bernie:

 Go for it.

Grey:

 Well, I made a new human.

Bernie:

 What?

Grey:

 I took one of my robots and reprogrammed it to think it was a human, now every robot that's keeping this city running thinks we've got a real live human in lockup.

Bernie:

 What for?

Grey:

 Well, the robots were built to save humanity…. and they didn't do a great job and lost their one shot at fixing it.

Bernie:

 Sounds like someone else I know.

Grey:

 Well, I felt bad for them. All I need now is for you to tell the big guy that there's no real humans for it to maim or slaughter or whatever. I don't want it breaking into my facility again.

Bernie:

 I'll talk to it. You have fun with your robots.

It is currently under consideration to inform the public of the existence of SCP-7220.
