Item #: SCP-8148

Object Class: Keter

 

Special Containment Procedures:

 Foundation security at all Temporary Object-Holding Sites are to be informed of SCP-8148’s alias and appearance. Security is to detain and amnesticize any SCP-8148 instances and store it on site until the conclusion of its according SCP-8148-1 event. Security is permitted to terminate SCP-8148 if it is uncooperative. Once the corresponding SCP-8148-1 event has concluded, the SCP-8148 instance is to be relocated to a permanent humanoid holding cell and is to be contained until SCP-8148 demanifests.

Description:

 SCP-8148 is a 180.34 cm tall Type Blue 27-year-old caucasian male who refers to itself as “Doctor Silvian King.” SCP-8148 believes itself to be a Foundation Researcher of thaumatology.

1

 No Foundation employee has been taught thaumatology due to its anomalous nature. There is also no record of the Foundation employing a "Doctor Silvian King" at any point in its history. Despite SCP-8148 visibly aging while in containment, it always remanifests at 27 years old.

SCP-8148’s anomalous effect appears when a Temporary Object-Holding Site contains at least 1 temporary dormitory. Appearing to be asleep, at exactly 

00:00

, SCP-8148 may manifest inside the bed of an empty temporary dormitory. The likelihood of an SCP-8148 instance manifesting increases with the number of SCP objects and D-Class stored at the site. SCP-8148 will wake up at 

08:00,

 and, during the day, will usually attempt to aid staff in their activities. SCP-8148 shows varying degrees of knowledge in the task it attempts to assist in. Its behavior is also highly dependent on manifestation.

SCP-8148 has reacted to staff in a variety of ways ranging from complete obedience to orders given to it, to disregarding staff and acting outwardly violent towards them. On rare occasions, SCP-8148 has attempted to break into on-site armories.

SCP-8148 will stay manifested until its anomalous effects trigger again, at which point it will demanifest and a new manifestation of SCP-8148 will appear. This effect persists after death. Within 24 hours after the manifestation of SCP-8148, SCP-8148-1 will occur. SCP-8148-1 is the breach of containment at the site where SCP-8148 manifested. SCP-8148-1 has been observed containing several different types of breaches, all of which are listed below:

The breach of Keter Class anomalies.

The breach of Euclid class anomalies.

The invasion of the Site by an enemy GOI.

The invasion of the Site by an anomaly.

The escape attempt of D-Class Personnel.

The manifestation of a new anomaly.

SCP-8148 believes that it has survived all SCP-8148-1 instances it's interacted with. SCP-8148's behavior is inconsistent along with its memory of all the SCP-8148-1 events it has been involved with, commonly forgetting or referring to SCP-8148-1 events that not occurred.

The second guard terminates SCP-8148 and both leave.

[END LOG]

All D-Class that contributed to the riot were terminated and incinerated. The 2 security guards that encountered SCP-8148 described that it was attempting to offer its help to resolve the breach. Once identified as an SCP-8148 instance, it became hostile, stating that its arrest was "unjustified" and "unimportant compared to the breach currently occurring."

"Honestly, I'm surprised my encounter with it felt like just another conversation I'd have with an employee. If it didn't keep mentioning bizarre books like "Harry Potter," I wouldn't have suspected a thing."
