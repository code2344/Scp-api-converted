Item #:

 SCP-6176

Object Class:

 Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:

 Wing G of Site-301 has been converted to act as SCP-6176's primary containment chamber, currently a 4.5m wide cube-shaped room, initially intended to act as a supply room for janitorial staff. Organic personnel are not permitted to enter wing G. Instead, Kederesk.aic has been assigned to monitor and report on SCP-6176.

Dr. Carè after exposure to D-2133 (SCP-6176)

Description:

 SCP-6176 is a 

specific existential

, metaphysical construct or entity currently maintained in wing G at Site-301.

SCP-6176 is a metaphysical embodiment of its metaphysical self, which has produced an intense feedback loop in which SCP-6176 continuously reiterates itself. This process is indefinite as long as SCP-6176 remains conceptually alive. This is due to SCP-6176 being capable of visualising how subjects externally perceive itself, which inturn alters its own metaphysical self, which results in the feedback loop. SCP-6176 invariably becomes inert once it no longer becomes subjectively perceived by an organic individual.

Due to external perception of it, SCP-6176 primarily has taken a humanoid shape. Whether SCP-6176 in this state is conscious is still unknown, as external perception doesn't lead to change in SCP-6176 internally. However, if an iteration of SCP-6176 is produced off the basis of a hominid-centred perception, then it is likely SCP-6176 has manifested some form of consciousness. SCP-6176 iterations that are likely to be conscious are designated as SCP-6176-Prime instances. While the exact parameters for a prime instance are unclear, the Foundation has documented the appearance of 4 prime instances which have come about since SCP-6176's containment in 1972.

Addendum-1:

 Several tests were performed on SCP-6176 to see its reactions to external perception of it based on different states of consciousness.

Conscious State:

 Waking

Subject:

 D-4972

Result:

 SCP-6176 performed as was expected, in which a humanoid shape was formed during the subsequent iterations. No prime instances were produced.

Conscious State:

 Sleeping

Subject:

 D-4972

Result:

 No result, as D-4972 did not visually perceive SCP-6176.

Conscious State:

 Dreaming

Subject:

 D-2133

D-2133 was exposed to several images relating to SCP-6176, symbolic and metaphorical in nature. D-2133 was also allowed to converse with D-4972 regarding SCP-6176 before the test was conducted.

Result:

 SCP-6176 formed a humanoid shape which assumed the supine position. D-2133 proceeded to open their eyes, however was in a paralytic state. SCP-6176 formed superficial eyes which rapidly looked around before they formed into three images.

The first featured a young boy sitting beside an older woman in a hospital bed hooked up to a breathing apparatus.

The second featured the same young boy pulling away the blinds of a window at several other children playing basketball in the street.

The third featured the young boy in a suit and tie sitting at the bottom of a wooden staircase, crying into their hands.

Conscious State:

 Transcendental Consciousness

Subject:

 D-4972 and D-2133

Result:

 SCP-6176 formed several hominid-centred conceptual identifiers present within the noosphere, specifically ones which relate to both D-4972 and D-2133. Notable examples were: names, memories, aspirations and personalities.

Conscious State:

 Cosmic Consciousness

Subject:

 D-4972 and D-2133

Result:

 SCP-6176 formed a brain, with several roots growing from its base. This was followed by the manifestation of several symbolic images, which were incomprehensible to D-4972 and D-2133.

Conscious State:

 God Consciousness

Subject:

 D-4972 and D-2133

Result:

 SCP-6176 became a unified self-expression of its own perceived deific status among several GoI's. These formations expressed their own consciousness, which further reinforced SCP-6176 during later iterations.

Conscious State:

 Unity Consciousness

Subject:

 D-4972 and D-2133

Result:

 SCP-6176 becomes the expression of all human perception. This was demonstrated when D-4972 broke visual contact and stared down at the concrete floor. This prompted SCP-6176 to form into concrete, as well as manifesting several symbolic images of concepts such as "Underneath" and "Floor".

Testing was concluded after it was deemed SCP-6176 had gained too much of an understanding of human consciousness to the point where it became capable of self-sustaining itself. SCP-6176 began to form a symbolic representation of consciousness which later evolved into an isolated conscious form within SCP-6176. This form then internally perceived SCP-6176 which then prompted the formation of a volatile prime instance.

Addendum-2:

 Once the SCP-6176-Prime instance was formed, it was deemed too essophysically dangerous to remain in wing G. Thus it was put to a vote for whether SCP-6176 should be transferred to the 

Adaptive Containment Chamber (ACC)

 at Site-301.

For

 — 67%

Novote

 — 13%

Against

 — 20%

SCP-6176 was subsequently transported into the ACC.

Transcriptor:

 Kederesk.aic

Begin…

12:00

 SCP-6176 is placed within the chamber via the use of a transport automaton. The chamber is sealed and the adaptive lining is activated.

12:34

 The walls of the ACC begin to glow measuring around 650°C.

12:45

 Several adaptive plates begin to melt off the chamber walls. SCP-6176 grows more volatile.

13:11

 The chamber begins to stabilise with SCP-6176 reducing in size.

13:25

 SCP-6176 forms into both D-4972 and D-2133. Both D-class are found to now be absent from their quarters.

13:56

 SCP-6176 forms several thought forms. These forms then are reduced into their base concepts.

14:05

 SCP-6176 projects a noospheric pattern onto the chamber walls.

14:17

 Kederesk.aic is compromised as SCP-6176 forms into a deific automaton that begins breaking several of the adaptive plates.

14:48

 SCP-6176 then disappears. D-2133 is found back in their cell. D-4972's bed is found to be covered in dead butterflies.

…End

Note:

 The ACC was examined for structural damages. It was discovered that the ACC has already been used to contain 

another anomaly

, which was likely the reason SCP-6176's containment was compromised.

Addendum-3:

 An interview was performed with D-2133 following SCP-6176's transference into the ACC.

<Begin Log>

Dr. Carè:

 So you were temporarily transported into the ACC. Could you tell me a little bit about what you saw?

D-2133 is silent for 10 seconds, looking down at the floor.

D-2133:

 What's that?

Dr. Carè:

 The ACC? It's pretty simple…

D-2133:

 No, that (D-2133 points behind Dr. Care).

Dr. Carè:

 (Looking behind) I'm not sure what you're referring to?

D-2133:

 Oh, this is a pretty new experience for me.

D-2133 looks down at their hands, the number of digits fluctuating from 1 to 400. Dr. Carè doesn't notice this.

D-2133:

 Do you think if mankind ever heard God, they'd react in fear or hope? Just a piece of God, like a heartbeat or something?

Dr. Carè:

 I… don't think I've got an answer for that. Could you please try and answer the question.

D-2133:

 Well the chamber I was in adapts to contain it right?

Dr. Carè wipes blood away from his nose.

Dr. Carè:

 Yeah that's what it was designed for. Your point?

D-2133:

 If the embodiment of itself eventually became conscious, then the chamber introduced something that would break this. That would be showing the entity nothing.

Dr. Carè:

 So you're saying the ACC performed an unauthorised termination?

D-2133:

 Well, nothing ain't something a human's capable of perceiving. Most likely it repurposed the robot to do that. Even then it only caused its consciousness to burst. You can't introduce something as complex a consciousness to something as miniscule as nothing, that would simply break the laws of thermodynamics.

Dr. Carè:

 (Coughing) So where is SCP-6176 now?

Dr. Carè vomits and collapses onto the table.
