Description:

 SCP-6558 is a phenomenon where a reference to the SCP-6558 slot manifests on any other SCiPnet pages

1

. The affected documentation will refer to the SCP-6558 page with unconventional designations

2

. All references to SCP-6558 vary wildly. Using context from the infected files, SCP-6558 has been described as a toy plane, green moss, a sound frequency, a time-traveling jester, a dog, and the feeling of love.

Although descriptions manifested by SCP-6558 have been overall incoherent, since its discovery, the descriptions have gotten increasingly coherent and relevant.

It is not fully known how SCP-6558 is able to spread. However, it has been determined that the higher the number of documents and devices containing info relating to SCP-6558, the quicker it spreads. Currently, all documents infected by SCP-6558 have been confined to the SCiPnet servers.

Special Notes

SCP-2941-6

Persian lime

(

Citrus × latifolia

)

SCP-2941-6's morale has been shown to markedly increase when placed in a silent containment cell. Researchers are to do hourly checks to confirm that the speaker placed within -6's current bio-chamber is functioning correctly and that the audio file chosen by the current head researcher is playing on an uninterrupted loop at a minimum of 90db. At the time of writing, the sound of a knife scraping a glass bottle has been playing for eighty-four days.

SCP-▬▬-#

Tomato

(

Solanum lycopersicum

)

A spotlight is to be constantly shone into the containment cell. SCP-▬▬-# 

Hates

 spotlights.

SCP-2941-7

Turnip

(

Brassica rapa

)

Has expressed repeated desire to only be referred to as "Terry". Foundation personnel are expressly forbidden from doing so, but if absolutely necessary, they should refer to SCP-2941-7 directly, condescendingly, and repeatedly as any other name besides Terry. Names producing the most severe demoralization vectors so far include "Ferguson", "Wingding" and "Budz".

Ty Rex:

 Wazzaaap Jurassic junkies! It's another warm day out here in the woods and the pterodactyls are scrawing 

(Ty Rex closes his eyes while flapping his free arm and making a recreation of a loud "Scraw" sound effect)

 so I figured it would be a good day to go on a hike!

Footage cuts to a montage with a remix of various dinosaur vocalizations playing while Ty Rex walks through a wooded area, often focusing on various megaflora in the distance (currently the only known footage of the since Neutralised SCP-SAAN) or smaller animals skittering away in clearings, before returning to a shot of Ty Rex standing in front of a small plant with what appear to be berries (SCP-SAAN is not to be thought about.) A mountain range can be seen in the distance in the background of the shot. Dr. Grant pauses the video and zooms into the mountain range before beginning to speak.

 Contacting of Ty Rex is being attempted to have him remove all footage of SCP-SAAN. It Must Go Away. It Must Go Away. It Must Go Away. It Must Go Away. It Must Go Away. It Must Go Away.
