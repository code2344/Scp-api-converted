[D-24601 sits in front of a monitor in a testing chamber. Dr. Carter oversees the test from the adjacent control room.]

CARTER:

 For this one, we just need you to look at the image on the monitor and describe it as best you can.

D-24601:

 Sure thing.

[SCP-4214 is displayed on the monitor.]

D-24601:

 Huh. Funky-looking art. Looks like a jibbly keggle to me.

CARTER:

 Could y—

[Dr. Carter stares at D-24601 through the observation window. He is visibly confused.]

CARTER:

 Sorry, come again?

D-24601:

 A jibbly keggle, you know? Like uh, a scrimblo bimblo, a shbabbly shwobbly, uh… Perhaps a lorex unnu?

CARTER:

 D-24601, please take this seriously. Once again, please describe SCP-4214.

D-24601:

 But I have! It's a baba booey holding a small twiggo pinga. The iccum boccum really brings it all together, if I may add. The guncrow wiggowienny looks sorta wonky, though.

[Dr. Carter continues to stare at D-24601. He pinches the bridge of his nose and sighs.]

CARTER:

 Alright. I think I understand what's going on here. Thank you for your cooperation, D-24601.
