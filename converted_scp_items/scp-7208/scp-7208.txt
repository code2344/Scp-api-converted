Partially mapped portion of SCP-7208.

Special Containment Procedures:

 SCP-7208 is

CONSTRUCTS

 that make up baseline reality. As a result, the disruption of SCP-7208 or any of its constituents is to be avoided.

Due to the

 of SCP-7208, it may only be described using inherently nebulous language, such as 

semiotic pataphors,

 to using any designation other than “SCP-7208,” which inherently expresses no meaningful connotation as to the significance of SCP-7208.

further research has been suspended indefinitely.

Description:

 SCP-7208 is the

ABIGAIL

AMELIA

 Weaver

, director of the analysis of SCP-7208 until its indefinite suspension, is currently held in a standard humanoid containment cell until further notice.

From the limited portions of SCP-7208’s 

TOPOLOGY

CATEGORY

, it was hypothesised that SCP-7208 

PERMEATES

DOMINATES

 up to █8.14% of the Nöosphere in such a way that it at least partially intersects with human concepts of faith, hope, intention, and 

CREATIVITY

FREEDOM

.

As a result, SCP-7208 and its constituents are directly impacted by a subject’s 

interpretation

 of their meaning. This is somewhat 

ALLEVIATED

 by SCP-7208's special containment procedures, namely the use of 

pataphors,

 which effectively prevent subjects from constructing a coherent mental picture of the 

RHAPSODY

Incident-7208-π:

Notice:

 The following audio transcription was recovered from security footage captured in the

 office.

[knocking is heard from the door]

ABIGAIL

: "Come in?"

[a

 identified as Andrew Taylor enters the room]

ABIGAIL

AMELIA

 Weaver

: "I hope what you’re about to tell me is important."

Andrew: "I am sick and tired of this entire project."

ABIGAIL

AMELIA

 Weaver

: "You came to me just to complain?"

[Andrew approaches 

ABIGAIL

AMELIA

 Weaver's

 

DESK

]

Andrew: “Do you think you can blame me when all our research has been nothing but prancing around a single data structure, pretending that if we think about it as little as humanly possible, we might be able to draw it out of its shell enough to catch it in a jar, all so the Foundation can shake it up every time reality isn’t tickling its fancy?”

ABIGAIL

AMELIA

 Weaver

: "Andrew, you know very well our protocols and our rules regarding SCP-7208, I suggest you–"

[Andrew slams both of his hands against the 

DESK

LOOM

]

Andrew: 

"I know very well

 our pedantic platitude horseshit."

ABIGAIL

AMELIA

 Weaver

: 

"Andrew."

Andrew: "Are we playing hard-to-get with a 

memeplex?

 Why can’t we just nail this thing on the head and get our framework over with?"

ABIGAIL

AMELIA

 Weaver

: "We 

can't."

Andrew: "Why? Why can’t we? What’s the matter?"

ABIGAIL

AMELIA

 Weaver

: "Were you present during any of our briefings?"

Andrew: “Oh please, pretend I wasn’t.”

[a pause; 

ABIGAIL

AMELIA

 Weaver

 is seen burying her face in her hands, groaning]

ABIGAIL

AMELIA

 Weaver

: "We were all assigned by Foundation executives to look inside the Nöosphere at the idea, or the concept, or 

whatever

 of human 

CREATIVITY

FREEDOM

. What we found clung, or attached, or 

sucking up to it

 was a piece of a much 

bigger

 idea. When we mapped out more and more of it, we found it was just dissolved, just 

woven

 into reality as a whole, and because it was intersecting with 

CREATIVITY

FREEDOM

 

of all things,

 we couldn’t make any assumptions about it whatsoever, or else those assumptions would have become the 

de facto truth."

[Andrew is seen stepping back from the 

DESK

]

Andrew: "So we understand it more so we can understand it less?"

ABIGAIL

AMELIA

 Weaver

: "It would be best if we don’t understand it 

at all,

 but it appears to be necessary if we want to get any use out of it."

Andrew: "What use does it have if we can’t meaningfully interact with it in a way that doesn’t jeopardise our existence?"

ABIGAIL

AMELIA

 Weaver

: "That’s still to be determined. I 

strongly

 urge you to get back to your research and help everyone figure that out."

Andrew: "You have to be fucking–"

[Andrew approaches the door]

ABIGAIL

AMELIA

 Weaver

: "Where are you going?"

Andrew: "This is not worth the amount of time you put into it; 

it’s consuming you

. I’m not going to be part of a stupid fucking passion project."

[Andrew exits the room]

In the hour following the time of recording, all research of SCP-7208 was terminated. During the reassignment of personnel, it was found that no researcher named Andrew Taylor had ever

Protocol-7208-ρ “Rhapsode”:

 Using findings detailed in 

ABIGAIL

AMELIA

 Weaver’s

 initial reports regarding SCP-7208, the Foundation has developed an iterative ludometric framework which can 

DETERMINE

DETERMINE

 the outcomes of otherwise unpredictable circumstances.

This is 

ACHIEVED

 by generalising a circumstance into a family

.

∀A∀B[∃X:X∈A⇔X∈B]⇒A=B

 of 

ANALOGOUS

SYNONYMOUS

 designations, which are subsequently fed into SCP-7208. In response, SCP-7208 will produce an array of possible events.

The 

ludokinetic potential

 of each event is assigned a range of values according to a 

blatancy scale

 centred at 0.0 Jarries,

One

 where negative values are deemed impossible or illogical.

Personnel are reminded that measuring events to a single value will inherently alter them as a result of their perceived certainty.

Experiment-7208-ρ001:

Intention:

 To accurately predict the numeral that a twenty-sided die lands on prior to rolling.

Summary:

 The act of rolling a d20 die was generalised into a collection of designations, all of which were fed into SCP-7208. The outcomes produced by SCP-7208 converged upon "7."

The die was rolled, and it landed on "7."

This experiment was repeated fourteen more times, each time converging upon the correct outcome.

Measured Potential:

 0.9–1.3 Jarries

Comments:

 Non-integer values and values outside the range a d20 die is capable of landing on were both produced, all of which were measured to have negative ludokinetic potential. The experiment has been judged to be successful.

Experiment-7208-ρ002:

Intention:

 To accurately predict the arrangement of a deck of 52 playing cards prior to shuffling.

Summary:

 The concept of a shuffled deck of cards and the act of shuffling were both generalised and fed into SCP-7208. The resultant outcomes converged upon one arrangement, which matched the arrangement that was later produced.

The experiment was repeated using various other shuffling methods, such as overhand shuffling, cutting and rifling the deck, and the casino wash.

Measured Potential:

 1.7 – 2.2 Jarries

Comments:

 Arrangements which contained too few or too many cards, as well as arrangements that contained duplicate cards, were produced, all of which measured to have negative ludokinetic potential

The experiment has been judged to be successful.

Experiment-7208-ρ003:

Intention:

 To accurately predict the date and time of future seismic activity in Anchorage, Alaska.

Summary:

 The concept of an earthquake was generalised and fed into SCP-7208. The outcomes produced by SCP-7208 converged upon 23-08-20██ at 3:34 PM. The city of Anchorage was evacuated one day prior to the projected event.

A magnitude 6.8 earthquake occurred at the exact date and time

 by SCP-7208.

Measured Potential:

Comments:

 The Foundation is currently investigating the application of Protocol-7208-ρ in proactive responses to on-site containment breaches.

Experiment-7208-ρ004:

Intention:

 To accurately predict whether a pattern created in John Conway’s “Game of Life"

It is impossible to mathematically determine whether a pattern will halt; the problem is understood to be 

undecidable

 will halt.

Summary:

 Randomly generated patterns were fed directly into SCP-7208, which correctly 

DETERMINED

 their respective stabilities.

Patterns which are already understood to halt or not were excluded.

Measured Potential:

 4.0 Jarries

Comments:

 The Foundation is considering the application of Protocol-7208-ρ for other likewise undecidable problems in mathematics.

Experiment-7208-ρ005:

Intention:

 To 

DETERMINE

DETERMINE

 the outcome of a lottery ticket prior to playing.

Summary:

 The concept of purchasing and playing a lottery ticket was generalised and fed to SCP-7208.

The first lottery ticket played was 

DETERMINED

DETERMINED

 to win a jackpot of 25 million USD.

Measured Potential:

 38.5 Jarries

Comments:

 

Access to Protocol-7208-ρ has been restricted to personnel with Clearance Level 5 or higher.

Experiment-7208-ρ006:

Intention:

 To 

DETERMINE

DETERMINE

 exactly when SCP-106 will next breach containment.

Summary:

 SCP-106 breached containment, causing ██ casualties and widespread damage to on-site infrastructure.

Measured Potential:
