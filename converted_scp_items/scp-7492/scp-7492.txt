Item #:

 SCP-7492

Object Class:

 Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:

 Foundation assets placed among United States law enforcement, post-secondary faculty and alumni will flag potential SCP-7492 manifestations for review by MTF Kappa-28 ("School's Out").

Recovered instances of SCP-7492-A shall be delivered to the nearest Biological Research facility for analysis. Once identification has been made, retention is considered a low priority. Redundant instances will be decommissioned as biological waste.

Depending on the results of MTF Kappa-28's investigation, SCP-7492-B instances will either be amnesticized and released under long-term surveillance, or handed over to mundane authorities for prosecution. Reports shall be suppressed using Standard Cover Story 843 ("Tell-Tale Heart") or discredited via SCS 986 ("Collegiate Tomfoolery").

Description:

 SCP-7492 refers to the spontaneous manifestation of human body parts

1

 (designated instances of SCP-7492-A) in residential properties across the United States. Each anomaly is fresh and bloodless, with no signs of lividity, rigor mortis, or defensive wounds. Following discovery, SCP-7492-A will decompose at a natural rate. Other characteristics vary.

SCP-7492-A are always found among the possessions of a post-secondary student

2

 (designated SCP-7492-B). SCP-7492 events take place during periods of heightened stress, often coinciding with major changes in SCP-7492-B's life. Documented stressors include academic performance, financial stability, housing security, health, and liability.

Among cases known to the Foundation:

63% of SCP-7492-B contacted local authorities to report SCP-7492-A.

31% unsuccessfully tried to conceal or destroy SCP-7492-A. Under questioning, one-third of subjects blamed their actions on external factors, such as social, financial or legal consequences.

6% claimed recognition of SCP-7492-A and expressed a desire to keep it.

To date, every instance of SCP-7492-A has been a perfect biological match to the SCP-7492-B, despite the absence of corresponding injuries.
