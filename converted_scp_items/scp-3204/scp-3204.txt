And they were roommates.

 

Callie?

 

Callie, are you there?

 

Yes, Rhys. What is it?

 

Callie! Heyyyy :)

I believe I mentioned that document I was working on for 3204? Was hoping you could look over it and point out any mistakes. You're free right now, yeah?

 

Sure, just send it over. I'll come back to you when I'm done.

Item #:

 SCP-3204

Object Class:

 Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:

 SCP-3204 is to continue working for Site-140 as a RAISA representative, with confinement being restricted to mere observation. Dr. Rhys Amandine should be consulted regarding any issues SCP-3204 may have so it can be corrected immediately.

In addition, Amandine should consistently provide a sufficient amount of affection for SCP-3204 and remind her to receive breaks wherever necessary to prevent potential exhaustion. Physical and verbal intimacy, such as embracing her and/or complimenting her, is highly recommended to achieve this.

 

Wha

 

What is this?

 

Shhh, keep reading.

 

Hot chocolate prepared by SCP-3204

Description:

 SCP-3204 is Senior Researcher Calista Windward, a Class-IV thaumaturge possessing moderate to high levels of Elan-Vital Energy (EVE).

Windward's main abnormal property (excluding her dashing looks) is her telekinetic abilities, being capable of interacting with objects she can directly perceive. It is also noted that SCP-3204 possesses immense speed, strength and 

charisma

 far superior than the average human. Limitations to her flawlessness have yet to be determined.

1

She also makes some of the best hot chocolate (see given picture), being an overall talented cook behind the counter. While putting a lot of effort into her duties, SCP-3204 still manages to make time for Amandine, caring for her and ensuring she is spoiled and loved at any given moment. She is the best partner anyone could ever ask for.

Did I also mention how much of a stunning beauty she is? Well, she is.

Ms. Windward's other notable qualities include:

Her massive heart despite her cold demeanor;

Her hardworking attitude (even though she should rest more often);

Her acting like a teddy bear whenever we're together;

Her soft and fair skin, which feels nice to the touch;

Her ocean blue eyes I drown in every time we make eye contact;

Her blonde, majestic hair I want to entangle me;

Her lips;

How easily she gets embarrassed;

How much I like to embarrass her;

How much she cares about me;

How she notices the little things about me;

How warm she feels when she hugs me;

How gentle her voice is when she talks to me;

Her lipsâ€¦ again;

 

Oh my god.

 

What's wrong? It's just your standard article :)

 

Rhys, there are over 50 bullet points in this description.

 

Well, I just wanted to be more accurate, y'know?

I still have a backlog of all the features I couldn't fit in. Would you like to see?

 

â€¦

Later.

 

Addendum:

 Notable Excerpts

Below are a number of interactions between me and Callie (hi Callie!).

2

 A list of every single second I have with her is stored in the memory banks on replay 24/7/365, colloquially known as my camera roll.

Log begins.

Half past six in the morning. The sunlight pierces through the cracks of the curtains, lighting up the room. Snuggling comfortably under the sheets, a soft humming fills my ears. My phone lens peaks through the ajar bathroom door beside me, catching a glimpse of you.

A comb brushes your hair midair as you wash your face, getting ready for another weekend. 'So beautiful,' I mutter, my heart skipping a beat. I find myself watching you closely for a few minutes. Five, maybe ten, maybe more. I paid no mind whatsoever.

But suddenly, you let out a chuckle. My heart skips another beat.

Callie:

 Dearâ€¦

You turn your head to the side, causing me to instinctively hide my phone.

Callie:

 

(exhale)

 â€¦I know you're awake.

I gasp.

Rhys (me):

 How? I thought I was being a perfect Sleeping Beauty.

You face me, bearing a grinning expression.

Callie:

 You were giggling this entire time.

Rhys:

 Ah.

Pause.

You were right. I was giggling this entire time. My cheeks start to burn.

Rhys:

 

(clicks tongue)

 For how long?

Callie:

 A few minutes. Five? Ten? Maybe even more. Honestly, I lost count.

Rhys:

 Why didn't you say anything then?

Another pause. It was your turn to blush this time.

Callie:

 I like it when you laugh.

As the comb puts itself down, you come into the room. You sit on the bed, your hand caressing my cheek as your complexion grows even redder. I smile. Before long, though, you get up with a stretch and a deep breath.

Callie:

 I'll go ahead and make breakfast, okay?

You proceed to leave, but you don't go far. I grab your hand, keeping you in place.

Callie:

 Wh- What's wrong?

Rhys:

 Hm, I don't feel like eating today. Let's stay in bed some more.

Silence temporarily finds its place between us before you sit back down.

Callie:

 You're going to be hungry.

Rhys:

 I don't care. I wanna cuddle.

Callie:

 I'll even make you pancakes.

Rhys:

 Don't care. Cuddle. Now.

Callie:

 Rhysâ€¦

I close the distance between us, our noses practically touching.

Rhys:

 Don't you want to stay? With me?

Unblinkingly staring at each other, you forget how to react.

Rhys:

 Just for a few minutes. Five, ten maybe. That should be enough, yeah?

Callie:

 Mmâ€¦

I hold your hand in mine, our fingers intertwining. You hesitate for a moment before slowly settling under the cover and wrapping your arms around me. An experience I never wish to get used to, the tightening of your grip as you hide your expression.

I bury myself in your chest, taking in your scent.

You hold your breath, hoping never to let go.

We stay put until slumber takes us away.

Log ends.

 

sadkyugvhouia vweqy

 

Ahem.

Sorry about that. Just give me two seconds.

 

Heh.

 

Is this what you've been drafting for the past week?

Since when have you recorded these?

 

Not telling~

But yes, I did sneak some vids of you while you weren't looking. Thought it would look more 

immersive,

 if that makes any sense. Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯

 

"Immersive."

 

I'm sorryâ€¦

 

No, you don't have to apologize. Honestly, it's very cute.

You're cute, I mean.

 

Thanksies <3

 

â€¦

I gaze at you.

Rhys:

 What're you doing?

Callie:

 Hm?

You gaze at me back.

Callie:

 

(Pause)

 Working.

Rhys:

 Heh, I figured.

Sitting across from you at the cafeteria table. You've been making me meals for the longest time, so much so I find the site's food to be subpar in comparison. But the you in front of meâ€”the six-foot-one to my five-foot-seven, the diligent hands to my careless ownâ€”it's a treat unlike any other.

You're on the computer, the sound of your typing away bringing a tranquility to mind. Such workload, I'd perish under the weight of it. Seeing you here now, however, it's enough to keep my spirits up. A moment doesn't pass when I don't think about your arms, your faceâ€¦

â€¦your lips.

Something about you is different, though. Oh, I know.

Rhys:

 You're wearing glasses.

You look up briefly before returning to the screen.

Callie:

 I forgot my contacts. Besides, I'm sure you're enjoying the view. Doesn't hurt changing it up every now and again, wouldn't you agree?

Rhys:

 

(Exhales)

 I do.

Without a moment's notice, I move to the seat beside you. You back yourself slightly when I lean into your expression. One word, strawberries.

Callie:

 Uh, Rhys?

Rhys:

 Don't mind me. Just taking a closer look.

Callie:

 Please, stop teasing me. I really need to finish this review.

Rhys:

 Sure, if you beat me in a staring contest. Ready?

Callie:

 I- I'm sorry?

Rhys:

 Begin.

We stare into each other's eyes, taking in our sights.

I feel myself drowning again. If anything, this is an excuse. An excuse to look at you and to get you to look at me, an excuse to burn your image in my retinas. Falling in love over and over again, it isn't fair. I want you to know it, to feel it too. With every shade of red you're growing now, I hope it's another one of these messages reaching you.

â€¦

You look away, trying to catch your breath. I look at my wristwatch.

Rhys:

 45 seconds, a new record!

Callie:

 Are we done now?

Rhys:

 For now, yes. Thanks for the eye candy, babe.

I wink at you, showing off a wide grin.

Callie:

 

(Sighs)

 Well, at least I'm getting more used to it. Slowly, but surely.

Rhys:

 Huh? Oh, uhâ€¦ yeah.

â€¦

Right.

 

Another Saturday afternoon.

I stand by Holly's home, glass container in the living room bathing in the natural glow. Its wings flap ever so gently in the conditioned breeze, a pattern of orange and black complimenting my view. It must be nice residing in a space of leaves, flowers and an overarching branch. Such a tranquil experience, watching as a pet butterfly remains silently in place. A tranquil experience unlike any other.

And yet, I find myself sighing.

Facing my left, I find you sitting on the couch, the back of your head facing me. I find you shifting through a stack of papers, pushing your hair behind your ear and flipping between the pages.

Two mugs rest on the table, one filled with mocha and the other with hot chocolate. Two different drinks, yet their steams weave together regardless.

Rhys:

 Oh, Hollyâ€¦

I begin, speaking to Holly as quietly as I can. If it was sentient, it would sigh from those words alone.

Rhys:

 What'll it be today, hm?

Holly flaps its wings once.

Rhys:

 I could blow on her ear. Maybe hug her from behind? 

(Chuckles)

 It's been like this ever since I moved in, it's almost thrilling. Best part is she always reacts the same way. It makes me- heh, it makes me want to do it more.

You readjust yourself, inhaling deeply and letting out all the stress. I'm frowning just watching what more you have to do even on a weekend.

Rhys:

 Though, I should shake things up a lil' more. At this point, I'll be nothing more than a one-trick pony. Oh, but what to do? What to do?

It's only a matter of time until you get used to my antics. I haven't put much thought into it, but you've been handling my attacks better each and every time. Maybe something out of the box? Something I haven't even considered? To spoil you as much as you've spoiled me, it's a truly a puzzling task.

I tilt my head to the side, pondering the thought.

Rhys:

 Holly, would you know how to give a queen the ace of all hearts?

It pauses before flapping its wings twice. Then, it clicks.

Rhys:

 Well, I couldâ€¦ actually, hold on-

Leaning on the seconds passing by, I finally find my footing through the door. Even then, my heart races from such an idea.

Rhys:

 No, this'll be perfect. It's been a long time coming anyway. Might as well rip the bandaid, right? 

(Pause)

 Mm, I'm probably overthinking this- no! No, this is it. It'll be great, it's gonna be great.

I try to hold it in but I fail. A little slips out from my giddiness.

Rhys:

 Haha, now I can't stop thinking about it. I just 

have

 to do it.

Quickly, I make my way over to you and plant a kiss on the back of your neck. You let out a startled yelp, getting me to laugh. You stumble over your words, trying to scold me as you hide your face. Despite that, I end up kissing you again.

Another Saturday afternoon, and it's not enough. A kiss or two is never enoughâ€¦

But I know what is.

 

Rhys:

 I've been meaning to watch this. I heard it's really good.

Callie:

 Alright, I don't see why not.

It's movie night. The two of us are wrapped in a blanket on the couch, a bowl of popcorn between us. The room is unlit, save for the flat screen across from us. A monthly tradition, and another excuse to rest my head on your shoulder.

Honestly, I should be more focused on the movie. How many times have I been distracted by your breathing? Your warmth? More times than I can count on my hands and yours combined. I make sure to keep my focus, of course. A monthly tradition, and another excuse to talk to you, discussing the films we've watched.

A period of audible silence, occasionally interrupted by cheeky remarks and small bouts of laughter. Times like these, where time just stops as we take our time with these everyday things, I couldn't ask for anything more. These small pockets of nothing, they mean everything to me. You mean everything to me. A monthly tradition-

Rhys:

 Callie.

Callie:

 Hm?

Rhys:

 

(Opens mouth)

 Popcorn.

-and another excuse to gush about you, as you fly a piece of popcorn into my mouth.

I can't lie, though, it's hard to balance between these two things. It's especially difficult when I notice you staring at me, like you've been every time we hold these sessions. Silly you, you're not even paying attention to the movie.

Rhys:

 Aw, wow. That's just-

Callie:

 Mm?

Rhys:

 That's just beautiful.

Callie:

 Mmâ€¦

But you still manage to keep up with our talks. Maybe that's another knack of yours, who knows. It does feel nice when your eyes are facing me, like I'm on top of the world. You're so close, it's almost weakening. I wonder if you feel the same, if you still feel the same. Whatever happens, I don't want to let go. Ever.

A monthly tradition, and another excuse to see you blush.

Rhys:

 

(Whispers)

 Callie?

I turn to you. Your eyes are shut.

Rhys:

 

(Whispers)

 Callie, are you there?

You don't respond, your head resting on the couch. I ponder for a moment before considering. It's about time, there hasn't been a better chance than now.

I carefully release myself from your grip and, with a sneak and a step, I make my way to the kitchen. A few moments of rummaging through the cabinets later, I eventually find it. I can feel my heart racing again, I can hear myself giggling again. Returning to you, I crouch down and take one good look at your face. 'Soâ€¦ beautiful.' There, I turn to the thing in my palm, the tease of the century:

Measuring tape.

 

Oh, this next one's a personal fave of mine.

 

I think I know where this is going.

 

Callie:

 You don't have to do this, you know.

Rhys:

 Hm? Do what?

I look up to you from the sink, dishes in hand. You're seated at the kitchen table, holding a cup of coffee and an email to send. Standing by your right behind the counter, I raise an eyebrow as the running water fills the quietness.

Callie:

 The dishes. Or really, a majority of the house chores.

Rhys:

 What, am I not allowed to care for my blonde beauty of a babe?

Callie:

 Please, Rhys. You already pay for half of the rent. The least you can do is spare some of the responsibilities to me. I don't want you overworking yourself.

Rhys:

 I don't want to hear that coming from 

you,

 Callie.

Soap to the sides, waves to wash over. I take a deep breath.

Rhys:

 Besides, you welcomed me into your home all those years ago. I'm only showing my gratitude, showing you how much of a busy bee I can be too.

Callie:

 You've done more than enough, seriously.

Rhys:

 

(Smirks)

 Let your lil' Reese's Cup do her magic, honey.

You sigh but ultimately decide to stop. I let out a chuckle under my breath as I turn off the tap, setting the dishes aside. As I dry my hands, sneaking as many glances at you as I can, I take another deep breath. My hands grip the counter, I can feel my chest giving out. Something begins to weigh me down.

Here we go.

Rhys:

 You're pretty, Callie. Have I ever told you that?

Callie:

 Many times, upwards to tenâ€¦ daily.

Rhys:

 Yeah, but have I ever told you how pretty you 

really

 are?

Callie:

 As in?

Rhys:

 You know-

I begin.

Rhys:

 -it's like I can't get through the day without looking at your face. Not only that, but everything you do, everything you say. If anything, just being with you is enough to keep me alive. You're also cute, did I mention that? Yeah, no, you're really cute and I like it when you blush. Makes me want to spend the rest of my life with you, if you're catching my drift.

Subtle hints of cherry. You take a minute to process those words.

Callie:

 

(Looks away)

 Um, where is this going?

Rhys:

 

(Exhales)

 Oh, nothing.

You blink a few times, confused, reaching in to take another sip of mocha.

Rhys:

 I'm just saying we should get married.

You almost spit your drink, but you end up choking instead. Rose-tinted cheeks reddening more and more, your eyes widen in surprise. I rush over to your side and pat your back as you cough repeatedly. I take a hold of your hand, a burning star to grasp. Even I sense a flushed expression coloring my face.

God, this is too much. Even for me.

Callie:

 You- 

(coughs)

 I'm sorry, you want to what?

Rhys:

 Marriage. I want to love you even more so I figured we should put a ring on it. I can have you all to myself, you can have me all to yourself. It's a win-win for the both of us! Everybody wins!

I promptly close the distance, a few centimeters between ourselves.

Callie:

 Oh my- I, uh, ho- hold on-

You take a moment to compose yourself, gripping your chest and panting heavily on the side. I end up covering my face with a hand as well, trying to shake off this feeling. Even with your head turned, I find your scarlet ears to be satisfying enough.

Callie:

 You can't 

(deep inhale)

â€¦ just do this so suddenly.

Rhys:

 You confessed to me first, remember? How do you think I felt?

Callie:

 Still! Be serious about this.

I reach in and hug you from behind.

Rhys:

 I 

am,

 though.

A stillness meets the room.

Rhys:

 I want to walk down the aisle with you. I want to wear the most beautiful dress, so beautiful it would knock you off your feet. I want to see you in a dress too, or even a suit. I wouldn't mind it either way.

Rhys:

 I want to hold your hand and never let go. I want to wrap my arms around you, and for you to wrap your arms around me. I want to go on honeymoons, go to all sorts of places with you. Every moment, I want to spend them all in matrimony.

Rhys:

 I want to wake up next to you, and to sleep next to you. I want you to make me delicious meals every single day. I want you to hold me every night and whisper sweet things in my ear while I play with your hair. I want you to know how much you mean to me, how much you've done for me, and I want to remind you every time I can.

Rhys:

 I want that and so much more, Callie. I want youâ€¦

I pause, tightening my grip.

Rhys:

 â€¦I love you.

Callie:

 Rhysâ€¦

Another pause. You start to sob.

Callie:

 I- I love you, Rhys. I love you too. I-

You break into tears. I feel myself crying as well.

Rhys:

 I even bought matching rings. You wanna see?

Impeccable timing. You turn and grab my hands, causing me to yelp.

Callie:

 

(Laughs)

 Yes, of course!

I try to laugh it off as well. Goodness me, it is hot in here.

What's wrong with me sometimes? Doing this just to see you flustered, I can be so selfish. Well, maybe that wasn't the actual reason. Somewhere deep down, I might've been thinking of this moment ever since we got together. To create a bond stronger than the diamond on your finger and mine, maybe that's what those dreams were about all along. Maybe I was more lovestruck than I expected.

As I quickly retrieve the rings, thoughts start to flash in quick succession. Thoughts of the future and us and me and you and everything around us, they've been circling my mind for the longest time. I don't know what to make of it. But what I do know is that you're with me and I'm with you. That's all I need to know, that's all I ever want to know.

That jewel looks so beautiful on you, unsurprisingly enough. I hope mine looks just as good. You look at me with watered eyes. Mine might be watery too, for all I know. The two of us share a laugh, realizing just how ridiculous this all is.

And with a few moments to spare, I reach in and give you aâ€¦

 

mission success ^w^ (hi holly!)

 

Soooooo, how do you like it?

 

God, I just

giev me a minute

 

give*

 

Hehe, yeahâ€¦

Happy anniversary, babe.

 

I still can't believe you made this.

 

Yup! With my own blood, sweat and tears. All for you, my Callie :)

I expect to receive full payment by the end of the day >:D

 

Well, you're in luck. I reserved a dinner for two at that nice place downtown. I was going to keep it secret but I figured I should tell you now.

 

I was leaning more towards cuddle blankets and hot choco but this works too.

I'll be wearing my Sunday best then o7

 

Good to hear.

I'll be sure to embarrass you more. As payback, of course.

 

Hmmmm, I don't flush as easily as you, so I'm not too worried.

 

That's not true!

 

Is too.

Now, accept my love <3

 

Rhys.

 

Shush <3

 

Dear.
