Special Containment Procedures:

 SCP-8801 is to monitor its subject until further notice.

Description:

 SCP-8801 is an abstract monitor object

1

 created by the Department of Applied Metaphysics for use in data collection and espionage. SCP-8801 is capable of capturing experiential snapshots of a subject and their environment. Snapshots captured by SCP-8801 are brief and objective, and are stored digitally. The monitor object is currently undergoing preliminary testing prior to deployment. The test subject, a civilian human male designated SCP-8801-1, has been implanted with SCP-8801 since embryonic development.

Addendum 8801.1:

 Project Update

On 2017/10/19, SCP-8801 reported that SCP-8801-1 suddenly ceased to exist, and initiated emergency shutdown. The original schematics of SCP-8801, as well as all snapshots captured by the monitor object, have subsequently undergone mild data corruption. A preliminary investigation found that SCP-8801-1 is currently alive and in ordinary condition. The cause of the breakdown is under analysis and data recovery operations are underway.
