Nexus Forty-Four on the day of the EE-6460 disappearance event.
**Identifier:** Extranormal Event-6460
**Event Class:** Pending-Cambyses
**Operations for Containment:** Unnecessary. EE-6460 itself has concluded and no similar event, so far as the Foundation is currently aware, has since resurfaced in Nexus Forty-Four.
As to improve relations with the Laputan state, the Foundation has pledged humanitarian aid to help recover losses caused by EE-6460. This initiative, headed by agent Lemieux, is ongoing. Department of External Affairs personnel are to consult Document 6460-Luther with appropriate clearance for further information.
**Description:** EE-6460 was an anomalous planar disturbance that caused the disappearance of several objects and persons in Nexus Forty-Four ("Flying Island of Laputa") on December 19th, 1887. It would seem the effects of EE-6460 were limited to the Nexus itself, though the reason for this is unknown. The disappearances were instantaneous, occurring at exactly 4:16 PM, with their victims entirely demanifesting from baseline reality[2](javascript:;). Casualties included:
  * An estimated thirty-nine (39) civilian casualties (all Laputan citizens; no Foundation operatives).
  * Two (2) notable members of Laputan nobility, now designated PoI-6460-A and PoI-6460-B[3](javascript:;).
  * Several articles of Laputan paramagnetic levitation technology.
  * A small piece of SCP-68AG ("The Grand Lodestone")[4](javascript:;). Its removal led to a brief period of unpredictable and disruptive, albeit relatively minor, gravitational destabilizations across Nexus Forty-Four.
  * An elaborate necklace comprised of the teeth of _eques malignus infernalis_ (Greenlandic nuckelavee), previously personally belonging to queen Balnibarigoiis VI.
  * Several seemingly random buildings and pieces of public infrastructure, resulting in considerable damage to urban centers. Even with the aid of the Foundation, Nexus Forty-Four has yet to fully rebuild.

It is unknown whether the victims of EE-6460 were entirely erased from baseline reality or somehow transported to an accessory plane of existence. Further research is pending.
