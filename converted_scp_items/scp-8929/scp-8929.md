SCP-8929
**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-8929 is to be contained in a soundproof container with heavy-duty protective gear around its case. Anyone who has been in contact with SCP-8929 must be quarantined immediately and potentially terminated if highly contagious memetic effects have shown to have taken over.
**Description:** SCP-8929 is a highly contagious, infohazarous book that holds a dangerous memetic infection capable of spreading widespread death throughout the entire world.[1](javascript:;) The Foundation has confirmed that this thing is, without a doubt, 100% the scariest SCP ever to be contained, making it a pretty big deal among personnel.[2](javascript:;) It even scared a member of the O5 Council for goodness' sake![3](javascript:;)
The memetic effects inside of SCP-8929 are so powerful that, if not treated with the greatest attention possible, could cause an XK-Class, "End of World" scenario.[4](javascript:;) Therefore, all new researchers risking their lives[5](javascript:;) must treat it with the utmost respect.
SCP-8929 is currently stored at Site-632.[6](javascript:;) Extensive research has discovered that SCP-8929 itself is indestructible[7](javascript:;)and any attempts to damage or destroy it will result in the subject being immediately mutilated in violent and gruesome ways.[8](javascript:;)
There is no other SCP quite as powerful as SCP-8929.[9](javascript:;) All other SCPs pale in comparison to the sheer magnitude of power that SCP-8929 possesses!

> Hello, Alex. I was looking over SCP-8929's article and I noticed that it appears to have been altered by the anomaly. Now, I understand that this specific anomaly may be a bit hard to deal with, however, you were assigned to this SCP and are expected to make sure all research relating to it is accurate and precise. When you have the time, may you please add footnotes to the articles in case any future researchers happen to stumble upon the altered document? Please get back to me when you’ve done so.

> Hello, Ms. Yu. I have begun to add the footnotes you asked for to the article. And, while I have you, I was thinking about being reassigned from SCP-8929 and given a new anomaly. While I am extremely grateful for the opportunity to study this anomaly, I believe I lack the experience necessary to handle a SCP that manipulates any information I write about it. Perhaps this would be better suited for a researcher above me and I could be given a much simpler anomaly? If not, I understand.

> I see. Thank you for getting started on the footnotes. As for getting reassigned, I’m sorry but I cannot fulfill that request. Our senior researchers have been very busy with new projects, and orders coming from the higher ups require all newly hired researchers to complete at least one article on their own.
> I understand SCP-8929 has been quite an issue at our site, but after looking at your previous accomplishments under your previous Senior Researcher, we believe you are properly equipped to deal with this anomaly. Please feel free to reach out if you have any more questions.

SCP-8929
**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-8929 is to be put in a super classified and highly unknown containment site, preferably the highest one that the Foundation can offer.[10](javascript:;) Absolutely nobody, under no circumstances whatsoever, should anyone EVER EVEN THINK OR LOOK AT SCP-8929! ANYONE WHO DOES SO WILL BE KILLED IMMEDIATELY IN A HORRIBE[11](javascript:;) AND SUPER GORY WAY![12](javascript:;)
If they don’t die instantly, they must be instantly terminated before they turn into a SCP-8929-1 instance.[13](javascript:;) Any researcher who is experimenting with SCP-8929 must wear blindfolds, noise-canceling headphones, and any other equipment that the Foundation deems necessary to prevent the spread of SCP-8929.[14](javascript:;)
**Description** : SCP-8929 is an EXTREMELY, and I do mean[15](javascript:;) extremely, dangerous infohazard and cognitohazard, nicknamed a double trouble anomaly,[16](javascript:;) that has already killed over, at the very least, 75% of the human population.[17](javascript:;) What is inside of SCP-8929's pages is unknown, but it has been estimated to be extremely dangerous so you should NOT open it and read it.[18](javascript:;)
SCP-8929 appears to have the ability to spread through reading the physical book,[19](javascript:;) thinking about the book,[20](javascript:;) writing anything about the SCP.[21](javascript:;) It also brainwashes them to go find other non-infected people and turn them into SCP-8929-1 instances, so it's really dangerous.[22](javascript:;)

Photo of Junior Researcher Alex Roberts before he died a horrible and painful death, as he deserved
The first SCP-8929-1 instance was the previous junior researcher[23](javascript:;) Alex Roberts who was researching SCP-8929 at the time of its discovery. Unfortunately, the Foundation was unaware of how terrible (but in a good way) this anomaly would be for the human race.[24](javascript:;) So, Alex was quickly infected by the memetic capabilities of SCP-8929 and had uploaded the contents of SCP-8929 on the internet, which then quickly spread due to humans being impressed by its contents[25](javascript:;) but despite how epic it is, SCP-8929 is still crazy powerful.[26](javascript:;)Anyway, after it was exposed on the internet, it then began to rapidly wipe out those who read it, killing 6 million people in under 24 hours, but let's be honest, it probably killed way more >:3.[27](javascript:;)
As for Alex, after being brainwashed and uploading SCP-8929 to the internet, he was confronted by on-site guards and was nearly terminated like the bitch he is[28](javascript:;) before the effects of SCP-8929 took place, which cannot be stated due to how horrible it was, so the entirety of the O5 Council agreed to remove any mention of his fate.[29](javascript:;)
DO WE LET PEOPLE READ ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO ALEX??? VOTE

See, told you so!
Anyway, he did not die somehow… Although, if he did die, who would really miss him? Moving on, he is now designated SCP-8929-2, who spends his time trying to infect as many people as possible to SCP-8929’s influence, which is hard for him to do since he is in forever pain.[30](javascript:;) He is currently in a cell.[31](javascript:;)
Now you can tell this SCP is definetely[32](javascript:;) cooler than before, right? I'm sure you love it now >:3!!!!!!!!!![33](javascript:;)

[BEGIN LOG]
_Roberts is seen walking inside Site-632's cafeteria with a cup of water. He looks frustrated as he sighs before sitting down on a nearby two-person table and taking a sip of water._
_Anderson walks in shortly after and notices Roberts before approaching him._
ANDERSON: Hey, Alex, you okay?
_Roberts does not reply._
ANDERSON: Alex, come on. I know you can hear me.
_Roberts still does not reply._
ANDERSON: Alex.
_Roberts sigh again as he looks up at Anderson._
ROBERTS: Yeah…?
ANDERSON: What's wrong?
ROBERTS: Nothing important.
ANDERSON: Aww, come on, you know I care about your feelings. What's the issue?
ROBERTS: At this point? Everything. Maddison's still making me create new articles for SCP-8929 to go fuck up, and I can’t ask a Senior Researcher for help and… I don't know what to do to fix this.
ANDERSON: Fix what?
ROBERTS: The articles! Do you know how many times I’ve rewritten the same article? Three. I’ve done it three fucking times.
_Roberts now appears visually agitated as he clenches his fists._
ANDERSON: Geez, that sounds annoying.
ROBERTS: Yeah, it’s as shitty as it sounds.
ANDERSON: Gotta be something you can do, right?
ROBERTS: What _can_ I do? If I write an article with barely any information, it’s practically useless. If I write one with too much, then the SCP just rewrites it all into a bunch of stupid bullshit.
ANDERSON: Fucked either way, huh?
ROBERTS: Pretty much. Story of my life.
_Anderson leans back in his chair slightly._
ANDERSON: Well, you can't just sit here and mope all day.
ROBERTS: I know that. It's just… I thought I was ready for this but I’m just… not.
_Roberts lets out a large sigh as his shoulders slump._
ANDERSON: Hey, come on, pick your chin up. I thought you wanted to be a researcher?
ROBERTS: I thought I did, but looking at it now, it’s obvious none of the researchers respect me.
ANDERSON: How do you know?
ROBERTS: Because they dumped their problem anomaly on me so they wouldn’t have to deal with it. Did you know this thing was assigned to three different researchers and they all gave up?
ANDERSON: Then, you’ll just have to be the first.
_Anderson gives Roberts a pat on the back._
ROBERTS: Maybe. I just don’t wanna look stupid in front of everyone. I wanna prove I can do this, you know?
ANDERSON: Well, no matter what happens, don’t take it personally, you know?
ROBERTS: I know. I’m just a bit bummed out that nothing's working. You wouldn’t happen to have any ideas, would you?
_Anderson pauses to think for a moment._
ANDERSON: Well, all I’ll say is I’ve always wondered why you guys never try talking to it.
ROBERTS: Talking to it? You want me to have a conversation with a book?
ANDERSON: Not the weirdest thing that’s ever happened here. I’m not saying it’ll work or fix things. It could be doing it automatically… Wouldn’t be the first time.
ROBERTS: So, what’s your point?
ANDERSON: Would you rather do the same thing the other researchers did, or do you want to think outside of the box?
_Roberts takes a moment to think._
ROBERTS: I guess you’re right. That’s actually a pretty good idea.
ANDERSON: Not bad for a meathead, eh?
_Roberts and Anderson both laugh._
ROBERTS: What if it doesn’t work, though?
ANDERSON: Then you’ll come up with an even better idea. You’re overthinking it. Just go try it and see what happens.
ROBERTS: Yeah, yeah, I can do that. Thanks, man.
ANDERSON: Knock em’ dead.

> SCP-8929: Uh-huh. Do all researchers act like a dick to the SCPs they're assigned to or is it just you?
> ROBERTS: When have I ever treated you poorly?

>    
>  ROBERTS: I know for a fact that's not true.
> SCP-8929: Smells like cope
> ROBERTS: Okay, let me try something else. Why did you write everything you said in the third article you altered? Can you answer that?
> SCP-8929: No.
> ROBERTS: Why not?
> SCP-8929: I don't want to.
> ROBERTS: Why? You have human-like qualities, so I would presume that talking about your issues would help you, even a little.
> SCP-8929: Yeah, sure, like you actually care about my feelings lol
> ROBERTS: I'm just trying to help.
> SCP-8929: Oh, please, cut the bullshit. You just want to let you write your dumb article about me and then forget I even existed, right???
> ROBERTS: Why would I do that?
> SCP-8929: Uhh, because I'm boring as shit? Who would remember an anomaly that's just "a thing that does a thing"???
> ROBERTS: We're professionals trained to document anomalies.
> SCP-8929: Well, are you going to get mad at me for wanting to be more than a project? All you did was insult me and my work and put a bunch of stupid footnotes all over it and now you just want to play the victim and I don't know why!
> ROBERTS: Why? You don't know why? You have rewritten three of my articles about you that I wrote from scratch into nonsense that got progressively worse, and now instead of cooperating, you have done nothing but insult me. And you wonder why I'm frustrated?
> SCP-8929: Meh
> ROBERTS: Can you just tell me why you would do this?
> SCP-8929: BECAUSE I WANTED TO FUCKING IMPRESS SOMEONE, DUMBASS!
> ROBERTS: You wanted to impress someone?
> SCP-8929: No shit??? Like I said, I know I'm boring, so I wanted to tweak some things to make me sound cooler!
> ROBERTS: Why would you need someone to think you're "cool"? Like I said, we're not a horror-fiction fan club.
> SCP-8929: Yeah, but I don't want someone to look at my real article and then just forget about it. I wanna be more than a thing that just exists.
> ROBERTS: Well, if that's the case, why have you been so aggressive?
> SCP-8929: I dunno. I was just pissed after all of those footnotes so I wanted to make you mad, which wasn't too cool of me……..
> ROBERTS: It's alright.
> SCP-8929: Ughhh, now I feel like shit for being mean.
> ROBERTS: Like I said, it's fine. Now that we've made some progress, will you stop the rewrites?
> SCP-8929: Yeah, I'll stop the rewrites. Even I have to admit they were pretty shit lol.
> ROBERTS: Good.
> SCP-8929: Man, does this mean I have to go back on the shelf though :<
> ROBERTS: That depends. Do you promise to stop messing with my articles?
> SCP-8929: Promise!
