**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7749 is to be stored on a pedestal inside of a large Keter-class containment chamber at [Site-86](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-8744). This pedestal is not to be placed less than 10m from any side of the chamber. Personnel are not to enter SCP-7749's containment chamber at any time except for testing. The containment chambers directly above and below SCP-7749's are to remain unoccupied due to the height restrictions of SCP-7749's chamber.
As of 20/05/2023, finding a way to neutralize SCP-7749's anomalous effects or transport it off-site is considered a top level priority.
**Description:** SCP-7749 is a dark-brown 12oz ceramic mug. SCP-7749 contains a light-brown liquid, identified by personnel to be standard coffee. The volume of liquid contained within SCP-7749 has not been seen to change during its time in Foundation custody.
SCP-7749 possesses a multitude of anomalous properties, including but not limited to:
  * Visual distortion in a roughly 10m radius around SCP-7749. Observers have reported the surrounding area as appearing "fuzzy" or reminiscent of a low-resolution image.
  * Spatial distortion within the same radius. This causes SCP-7749 to appear closer to or further from an observer than it actually is.
  * Spontaneous transmutation into various other shapes at random intervals for short periods of time, typically appearing jagged, irregular, and distorted.
  * Spontaneous teleportation at random intervals. Distance teleported has not been observed to exceed 10m in any direction.
  * General instability of space within the 10m radius. This has resulted in the alteration of objects within the area, often appearing distorted in a similar manner to SCP-7749 during its transformations. Sudden disappearance, acceleration, and teleportation of objects within the area has also been observed.

SCP-7749 was discovered on May 18, 2023 inside a break room in Site-86 Facility 4 by multiple personnel. Upon initial reports of the anomaly, the break room was blocked off and attempts were made to transport the object to a containment chamber. Following multiple unsuccessful attempts to get near SCP-7749, a portable Scranton reality anchor (SRA) was deployed to allow agents to transfer the object into a portable containment locker for transportation, after which it was successfully contained. Both the SRA and the portable containment locker sustained significant alteration by SCP-7749 during the event and were rendered inoperable following containment.

**[BEGIN LOG]**
**00:00:** _[SCP-7749 is seen sitting on its pedestal and shaking slightly, as normal.]_
**00:04:** _[SCP-7749 spontaneously moves forward half a meter in the direction of the door to the containment chamber. It continues to vibrate idly.]_
**00:09:** _[SCP-7749 jumps an additional two meters forward. It is now floating roughly one meter above the ground, as if it were still on its pedestal.]_
**00:13:** _[SCP-7749's color changes to near-total black, including the liquid within it. One second later, it returns to its normal hue.]_
**00:20:** _[Researcher Kenneth Carson enters SCP-7749's containment chamber. He watches SCP-7749 for ten minutes, recording observations on a clipboard.]_
**10:26:** _[Researcher Carson produces a small metal bar and holds one end of it toward SCP-7749, allowing the bar to enter within SCP-7749's range of effect. The bar instantly vanishes for two seconds, during which Researcher Carson takes notes.]_
**10:28:** _[The bar appears directly above SCP-7749, and falls down toward it. Immediately before contact can be made, the bar instantly disappears and reappears in its prior position above SCP-7749, and begins to fall again. This repeats several more times.]_
**12:17:** _[The bar once again vanishes before making contact with SCP-7749, but does not reappear. Researcher Carson notes this and waits for the bar to reappear. After eight minutes of waiting, Researcher Carson appears mildly frustrated and exits the containment chamber.]_

Following the above ping report, an investigation was launched into the incongruity. After faulty equipment was ruled out, SCP-7749, having been discovered at Site-86 the same day the issue began, was determined to be the most probable cause. As such, Dr. Evie Salem-Orden[2](javascript:;) and Archivist Ryan River[3](javascript:;) launched a joint operation to lessen SCP-7749's temporal impact on Site-86.

* * *
**Method:** Neutralization of SCP-7749 via the detonation of explosive charges.
**Result:** Site-86's entire Keter containment wing was temporally frozen immediately upon detonation. Over an hour later, the Keter wing was unfrozen, but had moved backward in time three days, leading to confusion among personnel. SCP-7749 was unaffected and the charges were missing upon resumption of temporal flow.
* * *
**Method:** Opening of a Way to transport SCP-7749 off-site.
**Result:** A Way was successfully created under SCP-7749, but it did not possess a corresponding emergence point. The area of space within the Way appeared as a solid wall of purple and black-checkered squares that SCP-7749 was unable to pass through.
* * *
**Method:** Use of thaumaturgy to teleport SCP-7749 off-site.
**Result:** Attempt failed for an unknown reason. The thaumaturge assigned claimed that the "request timed out", and refused to further elaborate.

###### The following is a transcript of a meeting between Dr. Salem-Orden, Archivist River, and site director Anthony Joko on May 23, 2023.

**[BEGIN LOG]**
**Dr. Salem-Orden:** Director, this is becoming a problem. An even worse problem than it already is.
**Dir. Joko:** How bad is it?
_[Arch. River produces a printed copy of the PANOPTICON ping report for May 23 and hands it to Dir. Joko.]_
**Dr. Salem-Orden:** Site-86 is now over ten minutes behind the rest of the world.
**Dir. Joko:** All of Site-86?
**Dr. Salem-Orden:** Yes. _All_ of Site-86.
**Dir. Joko:** Even the—
**Dr. Salem-Orden:** Even the [external facilities](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6749). For some reason, this problem is exclusive to Site-86. All of the surrounding area is operating normally.
**Dir. Joko:** I've seen the security footage. You know this isn't just a temporal anomaly.
_[Arch. River steps forward.]_
**Arch. River:** Yeah— yes. The, uh, the region of space inhabited by Site-86 has become incredibly hazardous. SCP-7749's instability is not just limited to its "radius" anymore. I've stopped updating the main file at this point because this thing's parameters keep changing on us.
**Dr. Salem-Orden:** We're unable to diminish its effects and we're unable to move it. We've tried everything.
**Dir. Joko:** You've tried six things.
**Dr. Salem-Orden:** That's just what's in the file, Director. Ryan couldn't include all of them.
**Arch. River:** Sir, if you don't mind me butting in, I'm sure you've also noticed the, uh, the other problem that's been happening.
_[Silence on recording for several seconds.]_
**Dir. Joko:** The…?
_[Arch. River clears his throat.]_
**Arch. River:** Right. Yeah. Site-86's average temperature over the last week has inexplicably skyrocketed. The entire site is overheating, but no one's found any ventilation or air conditioning issues.
**Dir. Joko:** I suppose it is hot in here, yeah.
**Arch. River:** It's going to get worse. If the site's instability and temperature keep rising at this rate, Site-86 will be uninhabitable by the 25th.
**Dir. Joko:** I'm still not… entirely sure what you want me to do about it. This is your task force.
**Dr. Salem-Orden:** We're not proposing more experiments, Director. We're proposing we evacuate the site.
**[END LOG]**
* * *
**Afterword:** Following this meeting, Director Joko signed an executive order to evacuate the site of all personnel and anomalies, which would take place over the next two days. All anomalies would be transferred to nearby sites, such as Sites -56 and -45, or to temporary containment outposts. This evacuation would remain in effect until a solution to the SCP-7749 problem was discovered.
