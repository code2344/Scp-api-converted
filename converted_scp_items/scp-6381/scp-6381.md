**Item â„–:** SCP-6381
**Object Class:** Anomalous
**Special Containment Procedures:** The propagation of SCP-6381 is spurred on by the increasing Red Group Population. In order to prevent this, remaining Blue Group operatives should attempt to apply logic to the actions of Red Group members, initiating conversion.
**Description:** From an external, human-centred perception, SCP-6381 is a logical irregularity. Internally, SCP-6381 presents itself as an understanding of otherwise illogical phenomena. SCP-6381 is a nerve cluster located throughout the small intestine, in which an individual can be metaphysically [inside or outside](/scp-2719) of.
By metaphysically locating oneself _inside_ SCP-6381, they may express pro-apocalyptic ideation along with illogical behaviour that they perceive as highly logical. `Don't be fooled.`
Those who are _inside_ SCP-6381 are classed as the Red Group and those who are _outside_ SCP-6381 are classed as the Blue Group.
