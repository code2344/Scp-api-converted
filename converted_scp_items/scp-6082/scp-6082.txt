Yellowknife, circa 2004.

Special Containment Procedures:

 The hatch connecting SCP-6082-A with the Great Slave Lake has been reinforced. Access to SCP-6082 is solely granted to personnel with Level 4 Clearance and above.

Description:

 SCP-6082-A is a massive subterranean complex located 200 meters below Yellowknife, NWT, Canada, solely accessible by the use of a hatch located under the Great Slave Lake.

SCP-6082-A takes the form of a large, steel-made, pentagonal boiler room, comprised out of several mechanical devices, specifically designed as a power source for a compiled amount of activities. Analysis of the evidence found within SCP-6082-A points towards the anomaly being created using anomalous technology on the 11/27/1969 as a containment unit and power source for SCP-6082. The entity or group of interest employed in order to create SCP-6082-A and SCP-6082 is currently unknown.

SCP-6082-A is completely automated and it requires no human intervention in order to operate, possessing the necessary paraphernalia in order to complete its tasks. Some additional objects and components can be found:

Large amounts of piping.

Cylindrical glass tubes, containing pistons which compress material energy sources such as charcoal, raw petroleum, and uranium chunks into one, single homogeneous mass, later pushed through a pair of pipes. Such products are leaked through long, thin steel pipes.

Two wider, longer pipes by which waste gases are leaked, presumed to end in an unknown pocket dimension.

A massive hatch located in the center of SCP-6082-A, used as an entrance to SCP-6082. At the edge of the hatch, a control booth can be found.

A set of recordings of nearby galaxies, presumed to be taken from an extraterrestrial location within the Sol System.

A large, golden placard reading 

"Department of Abnormalities"

 located at the center of SCP-6082-A's hatch.

Several blueprints depicting a series of automated drones.

SCP-6082-A's composition has led the SCP Foundation's Paratechnology Division to believe that it is a containment chamber for SCP-6082. SCP-6082-A is, otherwise, un-anomalous.

SCP-6082 is a massive shaft located under SCP-6082-A. SCP-6082 is, as of the time of writing, currently inaccessible. Research into opening SCP-6082 is currently ongoing.

UPDATE 18/09/1999: Head Researcher Lancaster, there is an addendum waiting to be uploaded to this file. Open it?
