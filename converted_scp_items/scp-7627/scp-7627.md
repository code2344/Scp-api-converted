#### NOTICE FROM THE FOUNDATION RECORDS AND INFORMATION SECURITY ADMINISTRATION
The following database entry pertains to a situation that is currently in progress and, as such, is **incomplete**. This document will be updated as the situation evolves.

**Item #:** SCP-7627 | **Level 4/7627**

**Object Class:** Keter | **Classified**

**Special Containment Procedures:** Due to the geopolitical implications of SCP-7627's existence, as well as the Foundation's current policy of neutrality, direct containment of the item is currently infeasible. The Foundation’s primary objective regarding SCP-7627 is to monitor its progress via embedded assets within Soviet aerospatial agencies, GRU Division “P”, and affiliated anomalous research institutions.
Active diplomatic channels between the Foundation and both NATO and Warsaw Pact-affiliated governments are to remain open to prevent further escalation. No direct intervention is to be undertaken by the Foundation unless activation of SCP-7627 is deemed to be imminent.
Under no circumstances are Foundation personnel to engage in sabotage or aggressive action against SCP-7627 or its supporting infrastructure unless explicitly authorized by the Overseer Council.
Foundation negotiation teams are to engage regularly in talks with GRU Division “P” liaisons in order to maintain clarity of intent and avoid misinterpretation of Foundation neutrality.
**Description:** SCP-7627 refers to a Soviet orbital Eigenweapon platform, internally designated as "ZARYA-9", and colloquially referred to as the “Космический Молот” (“Space Hammer”). According to GRU Division “P” documentation obtained through subterfuge, SCP-7627 is capable of launching tungsten or depleted uranium projectiles at relativistic velocities[1](javascript:;) via a series of unknown and currently poorly understood paratechnical components and mechanisms.
The existence of SCP-7627 became apparent following a controlled test firing on October 30, 1961 over the Mityushikha Bay Nuclear Testing Range in the Novaya Zemlya archipelago. The event was initially announced by Soviet authorities as a demonstration of the Soviet Union's military prowess, with media broadcasts showcasing seismic data and atmospheric disturbances that far exceeded those produced by any conventional or nuclear weapons previously recorded.
Shortly after the demonstration, Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev issued a public declaration explaining the weapon's existence and purpose to both the Soviet people and the international community at large, framing the device as a purely defensive measure.
International reaction to the announcement was immediate and severe. NATO intelligence agencies scrambled to confirm the validity of Soviet claims, while both diplomatic and military assets across Europe were placed on heightened alert. Several closed-door emergency sessions of the United Nations Security Council were convened, with representatives from both Western and non-aligned states demanding further clarification.
Despite Soviet assurances, classified reports circulating among Western intelligence agencies indicated that SCP-7627 possesses capabilities far beyond those necessary for any reasonable defensive posture. Analysis suggested that a full-scale deployment of the platform’s payload could render entire metropolitan regions completely uninhabitable.
As of writing (12 November 1962), Foundation diplomatic personnel maintain standing delegations to both NATO-affiliated and Warsaw Pact governments under the Berlin Accords, established post-WWII to prevent the utilization of anomalous assets during global conflicts, in order to calm tensions between the two groups. Parallel to this, the Foundation and PENTAGRAM have opened talks regarding the potential joint neutralization of SCP-7627 should negotiations with the USSR ultimately fail.
SCP-7627 currently remains in a fixed geostationary orbit above the Eurasian landmass, and no further projectiles have been observed being fired from it since its initial demonstration.

**Special Containment Procedures:** Following the neutralization of SCP-7627, no active containment measures are deemed necessary. The monitoring of former Soviet aerospace and anomalous management assets is ongoing to ensure that no reconstruction attempts or successor projects emerge.
All files, recordings, and associated research related to SCP-7627 have been archived under Level 4 security clearance. Diplomatic channels with NATO-aligned and former Warsaw Pact anomalous agencies remain active under the Berlin Accords framework, primarily for continuity and legacy purposes.
**Description:** SCP-7627 was a Soviet orbital Eigenweapon platform, internally designated “ZARYA-9” and colloquially referred as the “Космический Молот” (“Space Hammer”), developed during the Cold War. It was equipped with an anomalous launch array capable of accelerating ferrous projectiles to relativistic velocities through unknown paratechnical means, yielding destructive capabilities exceeding that of conventional thermonuclear weapons of the era.
SCP-7627 was deployed into geostationary orbit in the early 1960s, with its existence confirmed by the Foundation following a demonstration over Novaya Zemlya on October 30 1961. Its activation greatly escalated tensions among governments belonging to the Eastern and Western bloc at the height of the Cold War, and planning for its neutralization became one of the Foundation’s highest priorities for the remainder of the 20th century.
On 18 June 1998, SCP-7627 was rendered permanently inoperative following an unpredicted collision with a high-velocity meteorite, later classified as Object I-1998-PLN-01. Analysis of the event confirmed that the meteorite itself was mundane in origin and that the trajectory of impact was purely coincidental. Due to the statistical improbability of such an event, it prompted renewed Foundation interest into the study of Tychokinetical anomalies; however, exhaustive review confirmed that no anomalous influence was involved in the destruction of SCP-7627.
Foundation operated drones managed to recover large quantities of orbital debris belonging to SCP-7627 over the span of six months following its destruction. However, proper analysis of the recovered components proved impossible due to their heavily degraded and fragmented state.
The destruction of SCP-7627 led to a measurable decrease in global geopolitical tensions. Internal GRU Division “P” documentation obtained following the dissolution of the Soviet Union indicated that SCP-7627 had suffered from significant long-term maintenance issues, and that its actual operational readiness in the late 20th century may have been greatly exaggerated by Soviet leadership for deterrence purposes.
Following its neutralization, multiple anomalous organizations, such as PENTAGRAM and the British Occult Service, issued formal communiqués expressing both relief and incredulity at the nature of SCP-7627’s destruction, unofficially referring to the incident as “The Dumbest Miracle of the 20th Century".

**Addendum 7627.1:** Although no usable physical remains of SCP-7627 could be recovered by Foundation assets, substantial documentation and data regarding the item's development were obtained from former GRU Division "P" archives. In light of this, the Overseer Council has approved the construction of a Foundation-manufactured orbital Eigenweapon[2](javascript:;) as a purely defensive measure against primarily hostile anomalous objects or entities [of extraterrestrial origin.](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/project-heimdall)
