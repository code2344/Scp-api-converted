Item #:

 SCP-8308

Object Class:

 Safe

Special Containment Procedures:

 SCP-8308 has been legally pronounced dead. Ownership of its works has been passed on to the Wilhelm estate. All known public recordings of SCP-8308's livestream have been deleted.

SCP-8308 is contained within a standard humanoid containment cell. Should SCP-8308 become responsive at any point, Site Director Richard Donn is to be notified immediately.

Description:

 SCP-8308 is Tony Wilhelm, author of ██ novels in the 'pulp fantasy' genre. It assertedly has the ability to perceive other realities, which highly resemble SCP-8308's novels. However, it is currently unknown how much of its work was inspired by its visions. The exact mechanisms and limits of SCP-8308's abilities are also unknown.

SCP-8308 at the beginning of its livestream

On 02/12/2024, SCP-8308 began a livestream on the social media platform ██████, which it began by announcing that it would be writing its next novel over the next week. It then began to narrate a chronological sequel to its previous work, 

The Mourner's Magiks

, in extreme, monotonous detail, which did not fit its previous style of writing. Throughout this narration, it looked directly at its webcam, did not blink, and took no breaks whatsoever.

On 05/12/2024, approximately 87 hours from the beginning of SCP-8308's livestream, Foundation webcrawler Memo-02 ("Marathon") alerted the local Site-309 to its unusual activity. After some deliberation, the livestream was shut down and an investigation proceeded.

Addendum:

Recovery

SCP-8308 was found at its home in Poplar Grove, Illinois, where it was still narrating its novel to its webcam, seemingly unaware that its access to the ██████ streaming platform had been blocked. Despite not having moved for around 90 hours, it did not show any signs of having urinated or otherwise dirtied himself.

SCP-8308, which continued its narration, did not react to any Foundation agents' attempts at communication as it was brought to a Site-309 Kant 

Hume

 Imager, where a Hume level of ~340 was observed localized within its brain. This level did not change until approximately 34 hours later, at which it dropped to a baseline, nonanomalous level as SCP-8308 stopped narrating. Notably, this final narration did not bring any narrative conclusion to the story of the sequel, instead stopping in the middle of a dialogue exchange.

Dr. Noah Addams was then able to conduct an interview with SCP-8308, which became responsive.

<Begin Log>

Dr. Addams:

 Mr. Wilhelm?

SCP-8308:

 Hmm? Ah, this is different. Quite different. And not quite what I'm looking for. But I suppose I can always expand my range.

Dr. Addams:

 …Tony? I'd like to ask you—

SCP-8308:

 Not sure if my publisher will like it, though.

Dr. Addams:

 Mr. Wilhelm, please. I'd like to ask you some questions.

SCP-8308:

 Ah, wait…

SCP-8308 looks to its sides, then at Dr. Addams.

SCP-8308:

 It seems like I'm here, then. You seem important. Dignified. Royalty, perhaps? What was it you said, your highness?

Dr. Addams:

 Dr. Addams is fine. I wanted to know more about your livestream, specifically—

SCP-8308:

 Oh, yes! My 

look

 into the wonderful world of Descotes. It's one of my favorites, even if not many exciting events happen.

Dr. Addams:

 Why did you decide to livestream this… so-called look?

SCP-8308:

 Creative processes are everything these days. I just wanted to share mine. Surely a woman of your stature should understand. You must show the little ones your own process, sometimes. To demonstrate.

Dr. Addams:

 Demonstrate what?

SCP-8308 points to himself.

SCP-8308:

 The 

gap.

Dr. Addams pauses for a moment.

Dr. Addams:

 I see. And can you tell me your process?

SCP-8308 raises an eyebrow.

SCP-8308:

 I'd prefer not to.

Dr. Addams:

 Wh— what do you mean?

SCP-8308:

 I'd really rather not.

<End Log>

SCP-8308 became unresponsive for the rest of the interview. Upon being escorted to a containment cell, SCP-8308 sat in a chair and has since remained motionless, showing no need to blink, eat, drink, urinate, or defecate.

Due to the hypothetical nature of SCP-8308's abilities, further investigations & interviews have been attempted. However, SCP-8308 has shown to be immune to amnestics, psychic suggestion (through both paratechnology and/or reality-bending), memetics, and other miscellaneous anomalous measures.

On 14/03/2025, during a routine inspection within the Site-309 Kant Hume Imager, SCP-8308 became responsive for a moment, and the Hume levels localized within SCP-8308's brain rapidly elevated to around ~360. It closed its eyes, opened its mouth, then shook its head. SCP-8308 then spoke:

I'd prefer not to anymore. Not here.

SCP-8308 has been unresponsive since.
