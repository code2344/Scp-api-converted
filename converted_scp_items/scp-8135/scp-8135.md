A collection of gravestones containing one affected by SCP-8135.
**Special Containment Procedures:** Embedded Foundation agents are to install speakers around SCP-8135-affected graves. In areas where this is infeasible, embedded agents are to promote instead the idea that the deceased's spirit is able to play music from their life as a way of communicating with the living.[1](javascript:;)
**Description:** SCP-8135 is a phenomenon affecting grave sites of musical artists.
Approximately 50 years after the death of the artist, SCP-8135 will occur. SCP-8135 will cause the deceased's entire discography to audibly emanate from the grave in reverse chronological order, and with each individual song playing in reverse.
**Addendum 1:**
SCP-8135 was discovered after Dr. Maslov T. Manferd was visiting a local graveyard and passed by an SCP-8135-affected gravestone. After he questioned a nearby groundskeeper, and his response of, "Oh that? That just happens sometimes.", he was brought in for further questioning regarding SCP-8135.
[BEGIN LOG]
_The log opens to the groundskeeper sitting at an interview table, looking anxious. Dr. Manferd enters the room and sits opposite the groundskeeper._
**Groundskeeper:** You again. What's going on?
**Dr. Manferd:** We just have a few questions for you.
**Groundskeeper:** Am I under arrest?
**Dr. Manferd:** Not technically, but cooperation will make this go much smoother. What do you know about the music playing from the graves?
_The groundskeeper looks visibly calmer._
**Groundskeeper:** Oh, that? Like I told you before, that just happens sometimes.
**Dr. Manferd:** Do you know why?
**Groundskeeper:** Well, y'know, in life, the music artists, that is, they composed.
**Groundskeeper:** And in death, they decompose.
