Beethoven's rolling in his grave.

A collection of gravestones containing one affected by SCP-8135.

Special Containment Procedures:

 Embedded Foundation agents are to install speakers around SCP-8135-affected graves. In areas where this is infeasible, embedded agents are to promote instead the idea that the deceased's spirit is able to play music from their life as a way of communicating with the living.

Description:

 SCP-8135 is a phenomenon affecting grave sites of musical artists.

Approximately 50 years after the death of the artist, SCP-8135 will occur. SCP-8135 will cause the deceased's entire discography to audibly emanate from the grave in reverse chronological order, and with each individual song playing in reverse.

Addendum 1:

SCP-8135 was discovered after Dr. Maslov T. Manferd was visiting a local graveyard and passed by an SCP-8135-affected gravestone. After he questioned a nearby groundskeeper, and his response of, "Oh that? That just happens sometimes.", he was brought in for further questioning regarding SCP-8135.

[BEGIN LOG]

The log opens to the groundskeeper sitting at an interview table, looking anxious. Dr. Manferd enters the room and sits opposite the groundskeeper.

Groundskeeper:

 You again. What's going on?

Dr. Manferd:

 We just have a few questions for you.

Groundskeeper:

 Am I under arrest?

Dr. Manferd:

 Not technically, but cooperation will make this go much smoother. What do you know about the music playing from the graves?

The groundskeeper looks visibly calmer.

Groundskeeper:

 Oh, that? Like I told you before, that just happens sometimes.

Dr. Manferd:

 Do you know why?

Groundskeeper:

 Well, y'know, in life, the music artists, that is, they composed.

Groundskeeper:

 And in death, they decompose.

. As similar beliefs are already widespread, talks are currently underway on having this be the main containment procedure, rather than the backup.
