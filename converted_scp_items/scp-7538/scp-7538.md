SCP-7538 instance
**Special Containment Procedures:** Instances of SCP-7538 are confined within a standard containment unit under the purview of the [Anomalous Entity Engagement Division (AEED).](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/anomalous-entity-engagement-division-hub) Assigned personnel are allowed to interact with said specimens on a bi-weekly basis in various recreational activities. Those outside the SCP-7538 management team may also participate with permission from the Research Head.
**Description:** SCP-7538 designates a group of sentient stuffed selachians colloquially referred to as 'Blåhaj', manufactured by the Swedish company IKEA.
Specimens of SCP-7538 are capable of levitation, travelling through the air in a matter comparable to swimming in the ocean. Despite bearing a resemblance to typical blue sharks, SCP-7538's behavior are similar to that of domesticated canines, being fairly docile and able to understand simple instructions.

**Addendum:** Recording Log
On the 9th of November, 2021, an unauthorized package was delivered to Site-757 before being taken in by Dr. Mako and brought to SCP-7538's cell. Due to this, Senior Researcher Anthony Clips was sent in to investigate the matter.
**[BEGIN LOG]**
_Clips enters the containment chamber while fixated on a clipboard he has in hand._
**Clips:** Good afternoon, Ms. Mako. Director Numen had sent me here to inspect a certain matter involving a recent package that arrived on-site. Apparently, I was told you would know about it so —
_He looks up and sees Mako, who is staring back at him while taping a boxing glove to the tip of an SCP-7538 instance's nose with duct tape. Her mouth is agape and her eyes are widened as Clips accidentally drops his clipboard. There is a brief moment of silence._
_A number of other specimens are also equipped with boxing gloves. He kneels down and picks up his clipboard._
**Clips:** What are you doing?
_Mako glances away from Clips before looking back._
**Mako:** What does it look like I'm doing?
**Clips:** It looks like you're attaching boxing gloves to your pet sharks.
**Mako:** Well, you'd be right, my good man. Thanks for the observation!
_Clips clicks his pen repeatedly and sighs._
**Clips:** I'm reporting you to the higher ups.
**Mako:** Wait, wait, wait —
_Mako scrambles to Clips, almost tripping while doing so._
**Mako:** I can assure you that I have a very reasonable explanation behind… _(gestures)_ all this. It makes a lot of sense once you hear me out.
**Clips:** I'm sorry but I doubt there's anything reasonable about _that._
_Clips points to two SCP-7538 instances bumping into each other using the boxing gloves. She turns to them and lets out a chuckle._
**Mako:** It's cute, isn't it?
**Clips:** That's… besides the point.
**Mako:** Eh, you were considering it for a moment.
**Clips:** No, I wasn't.
**Mako:** Are you _shore?_ Laying playful punches on your new fishy friends. You'd be down for that, right?
**Clips:** No, I wouldn't. That's ridiculous.
_Mako turns back._
**Mako:** Look, Clippy —
**Clips:** Don't call me "Clippy".
**Mako:** — _Clips,_ right. This is all just a misunderstanding. I mean, I’m only trying to expand on our recreational activities. Creating more games we can play together, you know?
**Clips:** And you jumped to… _boxing gloves?_
**Mako:** This is just an experiment!
**Clips:** This is a glorified show-and-tell at an elementary school.
**Mako:** Good g _reef_ , Clips. You're hurting the poor souls. Look at them.
_Two SCP-7538 instances are chasing one another. Clips raises his eyebrow._
**Clips:** You're hurting the site's budget.
**Mako:** No, I'm not. This is from my own paycheck, honest.
**Clips:** Then you're hurting your own budget. I'm leaving.
_Mako rushes to the entrance, blocking him._
**Mako:** I'm afraid I can't let you go, Clips.
**Clips:** Step away, Ms. Mako. You're being highly unprofessional.
**Mako:** No. I'm sorry, but you leave me no choice. _(Raises her voice)_ Finions!
_All SCP-7538 specimens faces Mako and Clips._
**Clips:** What the f —
**Mako:** _ATTACK!_
_Mako shoves Clips to the ground as the SCP-7538 instances approach him, proceeding to surround and punch him all over his body again and again._
**Mako:** That's right. Come on, boys. Punch him in the gut!
**Clips:** Hey, stop! Get off of me!
**Mako:** What's wrong, Clips? Don't you _sea_ how much fun they're having?
**Clips:** Mako, for the love of — _ow!_
_Clips shields himself from the specimens with his clipboard._
**Mako:** I'm sure it can also improve staff morale. Very entertaining, very fun. It's a jawsome idea, don't you agree?
**Clips:** _Ow!_ — As if.
**Mako:** Aw, you're such a gilljoy.
**Clips:** Mako, can you please stop this whole fiasc — _ow!_ — STOP THAT!
_The SCP-7538 instances stop and hesitate for a moment before continuing._
**Mako:** No, I still need more data. Just keep 'em occupied for a little longer, okay?
**Clips:** Ugh…
_The next few minutes consist of Clips being constantly hit by the SCP-7538 instances, occasionally but unsuccessfully attempting to wave them off with his arm. Mako then calls them off, causing the specimens to fly elsewhere and interact with each other again._
_Clips remains in a fetal position as Mako kneels down, staring at his face. He ignores her and turns to the ground._
**Mako:** So, _water_ your thoughts? What'd you think?
_Pause._
**Clips:** …I think I hate you.
_Another pause. Mako grins._
**Mako:** _(Inhales)_ Worth it.
**[FIN. LOG]**
Dr. Mako was later reprimanded for this behavior. The boxing gloves were also confiscated and removed from facility grounds.  

cmon clips  
i said i was sorry
No, Mako. You should consider this a warning for such childish conduct. Even if your department handles matters concerning the morale of anomalies, I did not consent to being endlessly punched by shark toys stuck with boxing gloves.  
Apology unaccepted.
okay, yeah, that was unfair. i shouldve given u the chance to fight back
What?
what did u do with the gloves anyway?
Like we said, they were disposed of.
no dont lie  
i saw that glimmer in ur eyes back there  
theres no need to be so uptide, u know
I'm not lying.  
Stop with the puns.  
And stop acting like you know what you're saying.
look, me and the other management staff r planning to have an all out fight with our sharks. twice as many boxing gloves, twice as many punches, twice as fun  
i know u said we shouldnt slack off like that but theres nothing wrong with loosening up every once in a while  
besides, we can just write it off as standard protocol. im sure its fine
Please, I have no reason to play around with you lot.
clips, its a simple yes or no question  
u wanna come with or not?
…  
Okay, fine.  
The gloves are in my closet.
cool, sea u next week
