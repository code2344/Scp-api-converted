**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-8394 currently resides in Cape May, New Jersey, under AIMB[1](javascript:;) supervision. The entity is to remain in Cape May permanently until further notice. Citizens of Cape May should not know of SCP-8394's true nature.
SCP-8394 has been provided with a false background by AIMB. Any question from SCP-8394 regarding its background is to be ignored or met with additional false information.
Under no circumstances is SCP-8394 allowed to use its anomalous ability. Should the subject perform its ability, AIMB will contain it in a standard humanoid cell and reevaluate its containment procedures.
**Description:** SCP-8394 refers to a low-level reality-bending individual whose identity, Joseph Martin, was provided by the AIMB. Subject's ethnicity appears to be a mix of Caucasian and Korean.
SCP-8394 is capable of manifesting mental images of inanimate objects into reality. However, it can only summon one object at a time, and each item cannot have another component. What constitutes a component for this purpose has not been precisely determined. Manifested objects are generic, with no branding, and disappear after approximately 1 minute.
The following table is a non-exhaustive list of objects that SCP-8394 is able to manifest.
Manifested objects | Notes  
---|---  
Water bottle | No liquids is present inside the bottle  
Pillow | Lacks any form of case  
Chair | A standard wooden chair  
One 4 x 2 Lego piece | Subject displays unhappy mood, explaining its attempts to think of a complete set of cat builds  
A gun | A standard AK-47 with no magazine present  
It is worth noting that SCP-8394 exhibits curious behaviour and is prone to investigating matters firsthand, which would cause a containment breach if it were to go beyond the designated area. It also displays dissatisfied behaviour when unable to get satisfactory answers regarding its past. Otherwise, SCP-8394 shows moderate cooperation and is well-behaved.
The Foundation first discovered and obtained SCP-8394 during a raid on an MC&D operation in Cape May on 14/03/2001. Found in an incubation chamber, it appears to have been gestated one week before acquisition. DNA analysis reports that SCP-8394 has a 98% match with Tobias Shin, a local politician suffering from cystic fibrosis. Despite this, SCP-8394 maintains a healthy body and has no complications. As SCP-8394 was deemed suitable for civilian life, it has been granted blue status[2](javascript:;) by the Insertion Unit[3](javascript:;).
**Addendum 8394.1: Welfare Check**
> **Interviewed:** SCP-8394
> **Interviewer:** Timothy Lewis
> **Foreword:** Timothy arrives at SCP-8394's home to evaluate its welfare check.
> **< Begin Log [6:00]>**
> **Lewis:** Good morning, Joseph. How was your sleep?
> **SCP-8394:** Could have been better.
> **Lewis:** How so?
> **SCP-8394:** Just something etched in my head that came me all night. I don't know how to describe this to you.
> **Lewis:** It's okay, we'll talk about this later.
> **SCP-8394:** Alright! So what are we discussing today?
> **Lewis:** We're just doing your welfare check. Other than your sleep, is there anything bothering you throughout a day or so?
> **SCP-8394:** Yeah, I wanna ask you something.
> **Lewis:** About what?
> **SCP-8394:** About my past.
> **Lewis:** Of course, ask away.
> **SCP-8394:** So do you guys had any security cameras of the night?
> **Lewis:** Excuse me?
> **SCP-8394:** Like, you said my mom left me outside the front desk, correct? I'm sure there could be any visual evidence that suggest that-
> **Lewis:** I don't think this is necessary, Joseph.
> **SCP-8394:** Wait, you serious?  
>    
>  **Lewis:** Yes, we'll discuss this another time, okay?
> **SCP-8394:** You can at least give me a CCTV screenshot. I won't budge.
> **Lewis:** Sorry, Joseph. I can't allow myself to show you it.
> **SCP-8394:** Why not?
> **Lewis:** It's…the foundation's protocol. I'm just following the rules.
> **SCP-8394:** Well, can I at least ask you worded questions then? Like does my parents had any reason to dropping me off there or something? Do they leave behind any items inside the basket like a letter or something? There should be anything that could link back to my-
> **Lewis:** How about what your schedule will be for today?
> **SCP-8394:** I didn't even finish my questions!
> **Lewis:** You should know by now that we need to stay on topic-
> **SCP-8394 then proceeds to stand up, walks up to Lewis and raise its hand.**
> **Lewis:** You do realise you would be in trouble for this, yes?
> **SCP-8394:** I mean…
> **Lewis:** Look, just go back to your seat, please?
> **SCP-8394 proceeds to go back its seat as it lowers its head.**
> **Lewis:** Look, I get it, we've been through this before. You've been thinking about it some time, correct?
> **SCP-8395:** Yeah, sorry.
> **Lewis:** I just want you to understand that this is for your own good. You'll have to wait for answers, okay?
> **SCP-8394:** Yes sir.
> **Lewis:** Good. Now are you ready to go through the schedule part with me again?
> **SCP-8394:** Let's go with that.
> **< End Log [6:32]>**
> **Closing Statement:** After the incident, Agent Lewis return back to make a written report. He states that SCP-8394 may be at risk of committing obstreperous activities due to its curiosity. He urges personnel to keep a close eye of SCP-8394.
