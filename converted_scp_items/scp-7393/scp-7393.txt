Special Containment Procedures:

 The entrance to SCP-7393 is to be locked at all times. All individuals assigned to explore SCP-7393 are to be informed that SCP-7393 is non-anomalous and contains nothing of significance.

Under no circumstances is the SCP Foundation Department of Unreality to be made aware of the existence of SCP-7393.

Description:

 SCP-7393 is a structure located beneath the abandoned Super Crunchy Bagels restaurant in Teaneck, New Jersey. SCP-7393 can be easily accessed through the store's basement and its interior consists of a single long hallway containing numerous rooms, each rendered inaccessible by a sealed metal door.

Each door has a glass peephole through which the contents of the room can be seen. Additionally, a metal placard has been attached to each door and is believed to describe the chamber's contents.

Addendum 7393.02:

 

Incident-7393-1

On 1/3/2023, Alex Thorley entered SCP-7393. They walked past the rooms of SCP-7393, expressing both dismay and interest at the contents of the various chambers. They proceeded to walk to the end of SCP-7393, muttered the words "I think I've been here before" and produced a knife from their pocket.

They then carved the phrase: "I am Alex Thorley. I exist." into the righthand wall of SCP-7393 and seemingly disappeared. Alex Thorley has denied all memories of this incident.
