**Anomaly â„–:** SCP-5097
**Anomaly Class:** Uncontained
**Threat Level:** Green
**Special Containment Procedures:** In the event SCP-5097 returns to reality, it is to be severely reprimanded and placed in a humanoid containment cell.
The note SCP-5097 left behind is currently held in an Anomalous Items locker.
**Description:** SCP-5097 is [Senior Researcher](/somnambulant-directives-take-the-helm) [Kassidy Kara](/hurt), a former member of the Unreality Department[1](javascript:;). On 4/8/2020, Dr. Kara removed themself from baseline reality and temporally ceased existing.
**Discovery Log:** SCP-5097 was discovered after Foundation .aic units detected a sudden loss of data associated with Dr. Kara[2](javascript:;) at 9:58 PM on 4/9/2020. At the same time, several personnel acquainted with Dr. Kara had noticed their lack of activity around the Site, and could neither access past e-mails with Dr. Kara nor send them new ones.
An investigation was launched, revealing their private quarters contained only a handwritten note on their desk (see Addendum). Whom it was addressed to is unknown.
Automated extranormal detection programs deployed by Site Command were able to recognize several residual [olf](/scp-5850)[3](javascript:;) fluctuations that had occurred within Dr. Kara's quarters. From the readings, a timeline of these fluctuations was established, revealing Dr. Kara had separated themself from baseline reality on 4/8/2020, at approximately 4:25 AM.
Dr. Kara was designated as SCP-5097 on 4/10/2020, and its containment procedures were officialized shortly after.
**Addendum:** The note left by SCP-5097.
