**Special Containment Procedures:** Incident-Selmsdorf is to be portrayed as a wildfire to the public. The area affected by Incident-Selmsdorf is not to be reforested.
**Description:** SCP-7055 was the collective term for two trees[1](javascript:;) separated along the Inner-German Border from 1971 to 1990, designated SCP-7055-W (West) and SCP-7055-E (East). SCP-7055-W and SCP-7055-E were sentient, and able to communicate via Morse code (by making “tapping” noises[2](javascript:;)).
SCP-7055-W and SCP-7055-E were ideologically similar to the nations they presided in, with SCP-7055-W being western aligned, and SCP-7055-E being the opposite. This ultimately ended up causing political strife between the two trees, which culminated in Incident-Selmsdorf, following the collapse of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in 1991.
