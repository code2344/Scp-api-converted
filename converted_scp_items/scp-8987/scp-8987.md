**Description:** SCP-8987 is a series of alleged anomalous occurrences and phenomena within the Red Brook Mine, located in Dutch Mountain, Pennsylvania. Information pertaining to SCP-8987 was leaked to the Foundation on 03/05/1966 by what appears to be an attempted whistleblower from Summit Anthracite, a Pennsylvanian coal company that has been in operation since 1952. The Red Brook Mine is the only mine owned by Summit Anthracite.
The POI who presented this information to the Foundation has yet to be identified.
The report alleged the following anomalous activities:
  * Notable loss of equipment.
  * Inexplicable alteration to pre-existing tunnels and mineshafts.
  * Deep vibrations, despite a notable lack of tectonic activity, even when no detonations are occurring.
  * The harvesting of minerals that the whistleblower could not identify.
  * Reported sightings of unknown figures.
  * Numerous other events that lack consistency or throughline, and are seemingly random.
  * The statement that "the brook runs red" was repeated multiple times within letter correspondence. This has been deemed noteworthy.

All these events are claimed to have begun in early 1963, when the mine's deepest point reached a depth of 170 meters below the surface, and are still ongoing. However, due to the vague nature of the leak itself, truth and accuracy are up for debate. An investigation into the Red Brook Mine, and Summit Anthracite, is ongoing and primarily being led by the Department of Geology under the name "RED CANARY."

# INVESTIGATION RED CANARY
![redcanary.png](https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-8987/redcanary.png)
_Led by Doctor Julian Eden, Head of the Department of Geology_
On 18/05/1966, a team of Foundation agents[2](javascript:;) were dispatched to locate and enter Summit Anthracite's primary building. The intention of the mission was to gain access to the company's archives and search for any available information on the Red Brook Mine.
The building was found to be completely empty.
**RED CANARY REPORT**
We'd been prepared for standard procedure. Had the fake papers and badges; everything that'd grant us “legal” access to their papers and allow us to stick our snouts where they don’t belong. But that’s not what we were met with when we opened up those doors.
Everything had been cleaned out. Whoever had been here left _fast._ We almost thought we had the wrong building for a moment, till I found the scraps of a poster in a dusty corner with Summit’s logo on it.
There used to be things here, that’s for sure. I can tell where they used to store records and what used to be office spaces, imprints on the floor where storage once was. But it’s gone.
Oddest thing is, none of this is mentioned anywhere. It wasn’t vandalized, that would’ve been reported. Dumpster in the back lot’s empty. No small town news, no records of the company moving their headquarters, nothing.
It’s like they just vanished.

With the attempt to investigate Summit Anthracite's main building proving unsuccessful, RED CANARY's search moved to Dutch Mountain itself — the location of the active mining operation.
On 20/05/1966, an undocumented mine camp[3](javascript:;) was discovered around Red Brook Mine. It appeared new but hastily constructed, and the deployed agents estimated that the area was housing up to 100 individual workers. This location was not present in any public records — its construction appears to have been wholly unauthorized, or just unrecorded entirely. This discontinuity was reported immediately to Dr. Eden, who was chief communication for the investigation.
Members of Gamma-89 were instructed to attempt to infiltrate the mine camp under the guise of employees, and recover information from the surrounding housing. They were to map the area and determine the equipment onsite in tandem.
The most notable discovery regarding the mine town and its operations was that, during day-to-day operations, they were excavating petrified wood alongside the anthracite coal.
The following snippets are transcribed from recovered journal and paper fragments from Summit Anthracite miners that have been deemed relevant to RED CANARY.  

**5/14/1963**
Weather was fine, bit of a drizzle, but when the fog coats the mountain I can't really complain. Looks downright lovely. Decent backdrop before throwing myself back in the depths for another shift.
While digging, a buddy of mine was going on some spiel about ancient forests turned to rock, and those old plants are what makes the coal. Petrified, or something, was the word he used. Apparently some folks are finding wood in the muck, or something. Guess trees can reach to these depths.
That, or he's just making some odd idle chatter to keep things interesting. There isn't much to talk down below, sometimes. That, or people are just too tired to. I've been getting a rhythm though. Get in, load coal, get out. Worried I'm gonna run myself raw with all the hand washing I do to get the dust off.
Fog was still there when I got out today, and the cold felt nice against my face. Been starting to get hot down there.
  

**REMINDER:** Find the missing carts.
  

Dear Abigail,
Have you been faring well out there? Been a while since I sent out a letter, but they've had me working long and it doesn't show signs of stopping on that side of things. Now I know it isn't proper manners of me, but I'm quite peeved at the changing of the guard that happened with the foreman. Robbed me the chance to give that bloke a piece of my mind! Wish that was the reason they sacked him, but the new feller seems just as much a piece of work than the last. Seems of richer blood, curls his lips at all of us.
But that's how it goes in this business, I suppose.
Did you know they keep birds down here? Little yellow ones with voices almost as sweet as yours. Apparently the reason they keep them locked down below is a bit grim, but those little yellow buggers bring a bit of life into things. You'd like them, I think. Canaries, are what they're called. Never seen one till I started working here, but they use them to make sure the air isn't full of poison.
Well, invisible poisons. The coal dust's a whole other story. Quite glad I never fancied wearing white.  

I hope this reaches you in good health,  
Dean Milton
  

[…] Something broke while we were blasting them holes. First we thought the dynamite struck one of the supports or didn't go off right, but no, all blew. The snap had been somethin' else. Cracked up the one wall, started leaking water. That ain't a surprise, everything gets soaked down below after the rain works its way through the mountain, but when I got closer, it just wasn't right.
Was this deep, stinking red. Almost brown. Alan said it was probably just from the iron in the walls. But iron stains orange.
The brook runs red. […]

**Figure 1.3:** Foreman Keshner (left), with one of the mine's workers (right).
The dwelling of the mine's foreman, Theodore Keshner, was located four days into the investigation. The building seemed older than the surrounding company town, and is theorized to have been originally for storage before the camp's construction. The date of the conversion is unknown, as is whether or not it occurred prior to the construction of the other encampments.
Agent Rosa Pierce was able to secure several pieces of official documentation relating to the Red Brook Mine, and provided scans of these documents before returning them to the building.
EMPLOYEE RECORDS indicated a mass layoff during 1963; primarily a replacement of upper level INDIVIDUALS/WORKERS.
These records included certifications, accident reports, medical papers, and employee records — all information that should've been held in Summit Anthracite's main building.
Several relevant documents have been included below. Please view the accompanying transcripts for additional notations.

### REPORT OF FATAL COAL-MINE ACCIDENT
### SUMMIT ANTHRACITE
January 15th, 1966  
By  
John Fulmer
**DESCRIPTION OF ACCIDENT**
On January 13th, 1966, at 4:45 P.M. in the Red Brook Mine, a fatal series of detonations occurred within the lower Northeast tunnel. Accident resulted in the destruction of significant amounts of equipment and tunnel, as well as the deaths of three miners (Kenneth Jameson, Ernest Beardsley, Gene Avery), and the injuring of two more (Carl Weist, Douglas Orchard).
The victims were of a five-man crew, aiding in expansion of the tunnel to facilitate further mining, when a premature blast occurred with the dynamite that'd been priming. They had started by drilling the blast holes into the wall, and inserting the sticks, while the fifth member of their team primed the wires to the detonator and ensured wiring was not caught on material. Before the group was able to clear, all dynamite detonated and the tunnel experienced a partial collapse.
Carl Weist claimed the involvement of a sixth individual that he did not recognize operating the detonator.
**CAUSE OF ACCIDENT**
Improper handling of equipment.
**RECOMMENDATIONS**
More care should be taken when handling explosive material. Re-assess detonation equipment for safety. Examine the faces of all workers prior to operation of sensitive equipment. Increase use of photo ID.
Re-excavate the Northeast tunnel and attempt again.

To whom it may concern,
I'm sending the coal through Summit's typical channel, company's name still got some use round these parts, it seems, even years down the line. The trains will be loaded by the time this letter reaches your desk, I’m sure. Couple tons to circulate around; decent quality anthracite and a bit of bituminous to match. Numbers been starting to dwindle on that front.
Most importantly, the next shipment of the wood should be coming up to you in New York soon. The veins of the stuff keep cropping up with little sign of depletion, which is good news for us. Been seeing better quality in the deeper ones, too. You’ll know it when you see the luster in some of the shipment.
Now, I know you want this mountain mined for all she's worth, but there's just an issue in all this. You think I can keep up this operation, with having to replace manpower so much? As I'm writing this, another dead man is down below. Accidents keep piling up, and I'm getting sick of signing off all these reports that come across my desk. If this keeps happening, something's gonna spill and this brook will be running redder. It seems the deeper we go, the more shit crops up.
Do you even know what we are digging for?
Because at this rate, I sure as hell don't.

Marshall, Carter & Dark

Despite ODDITY, RED CANARY initially considered NON-ANOMALOUS EXPLANATIONS for majority due to inconsistencies. Blaming symptoms from GAS LEAKAGE/BLACK LUNG.
This did not last.
Confirmation in the involvement of the known Group of Interest Marshall, Carter & Dark in the operations of the Red Brook Mine — via the purchase of Summit Anthracite as a front — lends heavy credence to the presence of anomalous activity within the mine, though as of yet no concrete evidence has been procured outside of events depicted in the information above. By this point in time, however, Dr. Eden had agreed to prepare Foundation operatives to seize Dutch Mountain.
In order to gain further insight on what may be occurring, and the layout of the mine itself for when the raid is commenced, Agent Rudy Weller was instructed to enter the Red Brook Mine.
**Video Log 8987.1**  
**Date:** 03/06/1966  
**Recording:** Agent Rudy Weller

![miners.png](https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-8987/miners.png)
**Figure 2.1:** From Agent Weller's bodycam.
_< Recording Start>_
_Agent Weller's camera is affixed to his breast pocket, as he enters the mine. He briefly covers it with his palm as he steps through the mine's entrance and into the dark. He removes his hand, and walks on._
_He illuminates his path via an open lantern affixed to his hard hat, much like the other miners. He nods his head at the pair he passes, slipping past the mine cart. Agent Weller holds a clipboard in his hands, and uses it to sketch out his path as he progresses through the mine._
_There is squelching as he walks, the mine floor muddy beneath his shoes. Rain water runs rivulets down the tunnels and walls. Above the static of Agent Weller's breathing, dripping can be heard._
**Agent Weller:** _[Muttering]_ Damn rain.
_He begins to walk on the wooden guides for the mine carts, instead._
_It is early in the morning, but there are an ample amount of workers about. Agent Weller passes laborers, miners, people loading carts with coal. After approximately two minutes of walking and mapping, he pauses and watches a pair of miners chipping away at a vein that appears a different texture than the rock body it lies in. Agent Weller would later report that what they were mining chipped away into brilliant oranges and pinks. They appear to have difficulty in removing it from the wall._
**Agent Weller:** You boys struggling?
**Milton:**[5](javascript:;) Heh? _[He turns his head]_ Ah, nah. Shit's just harder to break than the other rock.
**Agent Weller:** Is that petrified wood?
**Milton:** You bet.
**Agent Weller:** Damn. I heard about it, but I thought it was just some rumor. I'd signed on to a _coal_ mine.
_The miner waves a hand. The second individual still picks at the wall._
**Milton:** Oh we still mine that shit. It's just, eh, the foreman started having us mine it years back when we first started digging it up. Pull double duty on export. Something about it being of value?
**Agent Weller:** You know what the bosses are using it for?
_Milton shrugs._
**Milton:** Above all our paygrades, I'd reckon. If it's wood, guess they're building with it.
_Agent Weller nods, and picks up a chipped off piece of the petrified wood from the ground. He later reports that, as he examined it, it seemed to shimmer in the light — and felt denser than it should have. Agent Weller then slips it out of sight, with shuffling indicating it's been placed in a pocket on his uniform._
_The two miners return to work, and Agent Weller reaches up to tip his hard hat at them before continuing onwards._
_He continues to map the mine, making note of areas of structural integrity — the locations of lifts, platforms, and mine carts. Agent Weller occasionally pockets various samples of rock from the walls and floor for later assessment. He is at the outskirts of the mine, now._
_Agent Weller comes to a pause, and reassesses his map, while leaning against an empty mine cart._
_A hand can be seen resting on the cart. Upon noticing it Agent Weller appears to startle and takes a step back. An unidentified individual is leaning against the tunnel wall, dressed in typical miner's attire._[6](javascript:;)
![foreman.png](https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-8987/foreman.png)
**Figure 2.2:** Unknown.
**Agent Weller:** …hello..?
_The entity's exhalation is a wet, breathy whistle. It does not look at Agent Weller._
**Unknown:** You ain't like the others down here.
**Agent Weller:** What?
**Unknown:** You're not one of the workers.
_Silence on recording. It is then broken by the figure's wheezing. It leans over to stare at Agent Weller — who shies away with a stifled gasp as the lantern's light illuminates its face._
**Agent Weller:** I don't know what you mean.
**Unknown:** _Bah!_ You do. I know all the faces of the poor fucks they got down here. Yours ain't one of 'em.
_The entity lets out a low chuckle._
**Unknown:** Which means _wonderful_ things.
**Agent Weller:** How do you —
_He cuts himself off. The camera shifts abruptly, Agent Weller has jerked his head to look over his shoulder, down the way he came._
**Unknown:** They won't hear.
**Agent Weller:** Is that something you can do?
**Unknown:** Mm? Oh, no, no. There's just work to be done. Can't eavesdrop for shit over the sound of picks on stone, ey?
_Agent Weller stands in silence for a long moment, clearly tense._
**Agent Weller:** Are you the one causing the anomalies?
_The figure barks a laugh. It's a thick, wet sound._
**Unknown:** Ha! If it were up to me, I would've brought the mountain down while they all slept. Maybe drag that bastard Keshner into the rubble with me.
**Agent Weller:** Then what are you?
**Unknown:** The foreman.
_Agent Weller pauses in confusion. The figure continues._
**Unknown:** Not of these folks, of course. They already have one. I am the foreman of the _mine_ , not the men. My duty lies in watching below.
**Agent Weller:** So the mine's yours.
**Unknown:** I've more a right to it than they ever will, but it's still far from mine to claim. I'm merely trying to chase them out before something worse than _I_ crawls outta the trembling woodworks.
**Agent Weller:** Clearly it's not working. I dug out years worth of accidents from Keshner's desk. People die, they hire new ones, nothing changes.
_The entity hisses out a breath._
**Unknown:** Sickening, ain't it? Them black market bastards will run this place red before they give up what they think they'll gain.
**Agent Weller:** You know about Marshall, Carter and Dark?
**Unknown:** Hard not to, with that sniveling rat they put in charge. _[It chuckles]_ Good riddance you robbed his office blind.
_Agent Weller exhales. He roots around in his pocket and produces the piece of petrified wood he'd gathered earlier. He examines it in the light of his lantern._
**Agent Weller:** But why the hell are they here? What's so important about some hunks of petrified trees when the coal's far more valuable?
**Unknown:** Petrified tree.
**Agent Weller:** What?
**Unknown:** These ain't trees, kid. They're _roots._
_The camera is obscured by Agent Weller breaking eye contact to look down at the piece of petrified wood once again. There is silence on the recording for the following ten seconds._
_He looks back up._

_< Recording End>_
* * *
**Afterword:** Agent Weller would depart from the mine a few hours later, and deliver the map to Foundation operatives before rejoining with MTF Gamma-89 in preparation for the raid.
His interaction with the unknown entity was catalogued as evidence in regards to RED CANARY.
On 06/06/1966, Foundation operatives seized the Red Brook Mine under the pretense of a government shutdown. This occurred without incident, as the majority of Summit Anthracite's employees were civilian — with little knowledge of the potential nature of the operation — and did not resist Foundation efforts. All mining activity was thus ceased.
All individuals from Red Brook Mine were summarily amnesticized of their employment post-1963 and released, and Foreman Keshner was taken into custody after being confirmed as an MC&D operative. The area surrounding Dutch Mountain has been locked down and secured out of concern for any retaliatory efforts from MC&D.
RED CANARY's investigation concluded with sufficient evidence of anomalous activity to warrant designation of SCP-8987.
Discovering SCP-8987's nature would become the next goal of operations conducted at the Red Brook Mine.
![OROGENESIS.gif](https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-8987/OROGENESIS.gif)
All previous witness accounts of anomalous events that occurred within the RED BROOK MINE from 1963 to 1966 — prior to FOUNDATION intervention — have been assumed to be entirely FACTUAL.
* * *
## **Addendum 8987**
On 08/06/1966, the construction of Site-898 would officially begin, and would conclude approximately one month later. As construction progressed, the scope of the Site's purpose would expand. Site-898 subsequently became the Foundation's first geological research facility.
The head of the DEPARTMENT OF GEOLOGY, Doctor Julian Eden, would be promoted to DIRECTOR of Site-898 on 15/07/1966.
The Site was constructed within the original mine encampment left by Summit Anthracite, and the surrounding housing once used for miners and laborers was refurbished as usage for staff dormitories. This area, nestled within Coalbed Swamp, lies at the base of Dutch Mountain. The primary entrance to the Red Brook Mine itself was built over and integrated into the Site's grounds for means of further study, with the remaining open shaft being marked. Local geological surveys have been edited to reflect priority category Extreme Health or Safety Impact, Reclamation status in progress.[7](javascript:;)
![site898.png](https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-8987/site898.png)
**Figure 3.1:** Geological Research Site-898, interior.
Site-898 itself would begin operation under the cover of an non-anomalous geological research facility working in environmental reclamation. The Site was originally staffed by RED CANARY personnel, who were later joined by Foundation geological specialists.
After the establishment of Site-898 reached completion, Director Eden and members of staff would begin to re-investigate the Red Brook Mine. By proxy, this would resume mining operations within Dutch Mountain — though specifically being done by Foundation geologists.
Upon resumption, discordant phenomena associated with SCP-8987 also resumed. Aside from a positive correlation between intensity and excavation depth, no consistent patterns of behavior were established.[8](javascript:;)
Research into SCP-8987 continued until a major breakthrough on 24/08/1966.
**Video Log 8987.2**  
**Date:** 24/08/1966  
**Individuals Present:** Director Julian Eden, MTF Gamma-89[9](javascript:;)
* * *
_< Recording Start>_
_Dir. Eden is striding down the tunnels, adjusting the pager at his hip as it beeps. The camera is affixed to his hard hat._
_The sound of drilling echoes from ahead. He picks up his pace as the sounds grow louder._
_At the end of the tunnel are six individuals of MTF Gamma-89. Cpt. Lynn is aiding Agent Weller in drilling large holes into the wall. Agents Joyce and Reed are taking measurements of a vein of petrified wood with a heavy duty compass, while Agents Pierce and Bird are standing watch. They are a task force of field geologists, explosive techs, and engineers._
_Agent Pierce nods at Dir. Eden as he approaches._
**Dir. Eden:** You rang?
_He clicks his fingernail against his pager for emphasis._
**Agent Pierce:** Captain says there is airflow through the holes. There is something on the other side of that wall. _[She jerks her head towards Cpt. Lynn and Agent Weller]_ He wanted you here for it, probably to oversee.
**Dir. Eden:** A cavern is promising. Are we still on course?
_He peers around Agent Pierce, and Agent Reed glances over her shoulder._
**Agent Reed:** Yeah. Strike and dip of these veins—
**Agent Weller:** Roots.
**Agent Reed:** Of the _roots_ started getting mighty consistent about a couple meters back. We've been mapping a good chunk of them, and they seem to all be dipping towards a center point.
**Agent Joyce:** Which seems to be right where we are heading.
**Cpt. Lynn:** Which is why — _[He braces a hand on his knee and pushes himself up, grunting]_ — we think this cavern is what we've been hunting for.
**Dir. Eden:** Wonderful.
_Agent Weller prepares dynamite, checking the wiring that connects to a detonator a few meters behind Dir. Eden. He then looks up at Cpt. Lynn, and nods._
**Cpt. Lynn:** Alright, scram, we're gonna detonate. Keep it small, Weller, we don't know the stability of whatever is beyond.
**Agent Weller:** Yes, sir.
_Cpt. Lynn jerks his head down the tunnel, and all members of the team take cover a significant distance away from the tunnel's end as Agent Weller primes the detonator. He double checks the dynamite's wiring. He looks over his shoulder to the others for confirmation._
_Cpt. Lynn gives it, and the agent begins a countdown._
**Cpt. Lynn:** FIRE!
_Detonation successful._
_A sizable hole has been blasted into the wall. When the dust settles, there is only darkness beyond that gap._
**Cpt. Lynn:** Adjust your lights. We're going in.
_The team enters the space. Their lights do not pierce far. Dir. Eden scans large evaporite deposits that lie close to them, before turning his head back forward. Cpt. Lynn strides ahead._
**Cpt. Lynn:** Damn, she's bigger than I thought.
_Agent Joyce slips with a quiet yelp, causing the team to startle. Agent Pierce seizes his arm before he falls._
**Agent Pierce:** _Whoop!_ Be careful. There's a slope.
_Agent Joyce steadies himself, ducking his head at Agent Pierce._
**Agent Joyce:** Steep, too. Watch your steps.
_Dir. Eden keeps his head low as he begins to trek down the slope. He pauses, briefly, when his foot hooks on what appears to be an outcrop of petrified wood._
_The slope becomes gentler, and eventually flattens out. The sound of dripping water can be heard echoing through the cavern. Agent Reed tilts her head back and forth, seeming to try to gauge the cavern's size by that echo. She sighs and shakes her head._
_Agent Weller squints, adjusts his light._
**Agent Weller:** There's something up ahead.
_They press forward, and Dir. Eden can be seen repeatedly glancing around. His light catches on more outcrops of the wood, casting shadows across the stone. They're getting larger. His head jerks up to stare at the ceiling above. His light does not reach it. There is only darkness._
_Dir. Eden hisses in a breath and looks back down. He picks up his pace, and walks closer to the rest of the team. Agent Reed suddenly stops, sucking in a breath. It causes the others to still, confused._
**Agent Reed:** Holy shit. Bring the lights to 12 o'clock.
_Cpt. Lynn huffs at the order, but the rest of the team obeys._
_Their lights cast against a massive form at the cavern's heart. It is a tree trunk, 6 meters in diameter, with thick roots growing out from the base. Dir. Eden's gaze traces upwards along its form, and his light dimly reflects off of tangled branches above. The leaves upon them glimmer._
_The shadows of hundreds of branches, lined with crystal, loom above their heads. They still cannot see the ceiling. Estimates put the space at a height of at least 30 meters._
_There's a crunch, when Agent Weller takes a step back. He jolts, and the team all whip their heads over._
_He had stepped on a fallen twig. There are shards of crystal around it._
_There are broken branches and shattered crystal all throughout the base of the tree._
**Dir. Eden:** …It's been damaged…?
**Agent Joyce:** Can't be dying. It's already dead.
**Agent Pierce:** Still damaged.
_Dir. Eden glances over his shoulder at Agents Pierce and Bird._
**Dir. Eden:** Get one of the floodlights.
_The two agents duck their heads in a nod, and depart back towards the tunnel to retrieve the equipment._
_A few minutes later, they return. The large, albeit clunky device sits at the top of the slope as they adjust it. Agent Pierce ignites the wires so that the large bulbs can spark to life._
_The floodlight activates. Its bright beam pierces the dark._
_The room's ceiling is lined with both stalactites and branches, twisting throughout the entire length of it. There are millions of crystals glimmering off the branches of the tree, sharp prisms that cast shifting patterns across the ceiling._
**Agent Bird:** That's gotta be the size of a redwood.
**Agent Weller:** …All the roots lead here.
_There is a pause._
**Cpt. Lynn:** We're gonna wanna bring in more equipment. Get up some analysis, measurements, more folks down here. Weller, with me. We're gonna blast a bigger hole so we can fit shit through.
**Agent Weller:** Yes, sir.
**Dir. Eden:** Just mind the slope when you do.
**Cpt. Lynn:** Will do. Should be able to keep it back.
_The two depart, and leave the remaining five members of the team investigating the base of what will now be referred to as SCP-8987._
**Dir. Eden:** We should wait before gathering samples. Refrain from touching anything for now.
**Agent Pierce:** Don't have to tell me twice.
_Agent Joyce nudges one of the broken pieces of wood with his shoe, before stepping back when Agent Bird glares at him for doing so._
**Agent Joyce:** Wonder what's been making them fall.
**Dir. Eden:** I'm honestly surprised its branches still hang to begin with. Their fossilization should've rendered them far too heavy.
_Cpt. Lynn pages Dir. Eden, notifying him that the detonation is to occur within the next 10 seconds._
_The team turns towards the tunnel, meters back and up the slope, as the sound of Cpt. Lynn's shouted countdown echoes through the cavern._
**Agent Weller:** _FIRE IN THE HOLE!_
_Detonation successful._
_The cavern shakes, as dust and rocks explode into the air._
_There is a deafening snap, almost louder than the explosion moments prior. Dir. Eden turns back towards SCP-8987 just in time to see a massive branch crash to the ground meters from him. It sends a shower of shards out in its sudden burst._
_A thick, dark liquid oozes from the broken end of the fallen branch. Agents would later state that it was red._
![tree1.jpg](https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-8987/tree1.jpg)
**Figure 3.2:** SCP-8987 branch.
_All individuals have startled and scattered away at branch's sudden fall._
**Agent Bird:** _Shit!_ Blast was too much—
_Cpt. Lynn and Agent Weller come running back into the cavern. They have analysis equipment in tow. Agent Weller almost drops his at the sight of the scene unfolding._
**Dir. Eden:** Get away from the tree, _NOW!_
_Wheezing can be heard over the Director's shout. It is wet and heavy. Agent Weller's head snaps up, eyes widening._
_The crackling and snapping intensifies. Crunching like breaking wood and stone, echoing loudly throughout the cavern. The team scrambles away from the tree with shouts of confusion._
_More of the liquid gushes from the tree. It splatters down from the broken stump where the branch fell, spraying against the cavern floor. Dir. Eden just barely avoids being caught in that spray, his breathing audible. It syncs with the wet wheezes that are echoing through the cavern._
_Though nothing else falls from SCP-8987, the sounds continue. They are growing louder. There is an audible, white-noise hum._
_Agent Reed's compass suddenly breaks. Its casing falls apart, its hands and levels and gears tumbling to the ground. Glass shatters against the cavern floor. She yelps and throws its pieces in surprise._
_Dir. Eden's pager crumbles. Its screen turns to sand and pours down his leg, its screws fall out and its wiring spills. He too throws it to the ground, where it continues to come undone._
_The liquid spraying out from SCP-8987 spits and hisses as though boiling._
_There is a crackling noise from behind, and the team whips their heads around just in time to see that the floodlight's bulbs are cracking. The camera footage has degraded significantly._
_With sharp snaps, the bulbs in the floodlight all explode one by one. The glass and glass shards crumble to sand. The team's own headlamps soon follow. There's a THUNK as one of them throws their hardhat to the ground._
_The cavern is plunged into darkness. No visual feedback._
_Silence on recording._
**Cpt. Lynn:** Sound off. We all alive?
_All agents indicate clear. Dir. Eden states similar._
**Cpt. Lynn:** Did that thing fry all our tech?
**Agent Pierce:** Shit was shoddy to begin with. Open flames in a mine aren't smart, but I trust 'em more than I do any bulb.
**Agent Weller:** Wait — _shit do I still have it._ Hold on.
_There's a clicking, sparking sound. Agent Weller ignites an old lantern. The firelight flickers against the faces of the team members as they approach. Camera footage is still degraded, but functional._
**Agent Weller:** …Foundation tech might fail, but fire won't.
_Dir. Eden catches his breath, exhales audibly. He turns his head back in the direction of SCP-8987, though now it cannot be seen. The sound of dripping liquid is still audible._
**Dir. Eden:** So that's what's has been causing this…
**Agent Bird:** The tree gets shaken, the mine bleeds?
**Agent Weller:** I think it's been bleeding for a long time. MC&D were just twisting the knife in the wound when they took over.
_Cpt. Lynn sighs._
**Cpt. Lynn:** Blood from stone.
_Silence on recording._
**Agent Weller:** We should go before the lantern runs out of fuel.
_There is a murmur of agreement. The team shuffles to head back up towards the tunnel. There is a faint light emitting from it. The event did not reach beyond the cavern._
_Agent Weller glances back, and Dir. Eden follows his gaze as he ducks back into the tunnel. For a brief moment — in the low, flickering light — a humanoid figure can be seen standing amidst the stalagmites._
_< Recording End>_

**Afterword:** The team departed from the Red Brook Mine without further incident. Upon return, Dir. Eden was treated for minor cuts, being the only individual to have sustained injury.
Immediately, plans for SCP-8987's containment began.

**Figure 4.1:** SCP-8987.
**Special Containment Procedures:** Site-898 has since been established, and the Red Brook Mine has ceased operation and shut down as of 06/06/1966. No mining activity is to resume. The primary entrance to the mine has been built over and integrated into the Site for means of monitoring SCP-8987 and its activation events. The remaining open shaft has been marked, and local geological surveys have been edited to reflect priority category Extreme Health or Safety Impact, Reclamation status in progress.
Despite EFFORT, FOUNDATION SRAs have yet to fully CALM/CEASE/STOP SCP-8987 ACTIVATION EVENTS, but do lessen IMPACT/REACH.
A seismic station, monitored and overseen by Site-898's Seismology Sector and the OROGENESIS system,[10](javascript:;) has been installed within the tunnel connected to SCP-8987's chamber. A pair of magnetically locked gates separate this chamber from the rest of the mine, and an array of Scranton Reality Anchors have been constructed to stabilize the anomaly. To avoid immense power drain on Site-898 these SRAs are only to be operated by stationed staff when OROGENESIS detects an activation event.
Full access to SCP-8987's chamber can only be authorized by either the Director of Site-898,[11](javascript:;) or by the Head of the Department of Geology.[12](javascript:;) This authorization can be extended in case of emergency at its holder's discretion. However, all personnel are prohibited from taking samples from SCP-8987.
For activation events, defer to the RUNS RED Procedure.
* * *
**Description:** SCP-8987 is a petrified tree of unknown genus, whose roots and branches proliferate throughout the bedrock within and around the Red Brook Mine, Dutch Mountain, Pennsylvania. SCP-8987's trunk is 6 meters in diameter, with its branches reaching a height of 31 meters at their peak. These branches expand through the majority of the 41.8 meter diameter chamber the anomaly resides in. This chamber itself lies at a depth of approximately 250 meters below the surface.
Analysis of samples from SCP-8987's roots — harvested by previous activity — has shown that the petrified wood contains heavy amounts of silica, and minerals similar to those of baseline petrified trees. In addition, SCP-8987's formation within a coal bed has resulted in the accumulation of heavy metals within it such as chromium and germanium.
![crystal.jpg](https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-8987/crystal.jpg)
**Figure 4.2:** Photograph of SCP-8987 crystals.
In place of leaves, SCP-8987 has crystalline structures growing along its branches. These crystals are small, angular and white in color. While chemical analysis of them is impossible due to their sensitive nature, they superficially resemble hexagonal crystals such as quartz.
SCP-8987 activation events are surges of localized reality failure brought on when significant vibrations[13](javascript:;) within the surrounding environment trigger resonation within the anomaly's crystalline leaves. This destabilization of local reality[14](javascript:;) results in the manifestation of anomalous effects. These created anomalies, phenomena, or events are typically unpredictable in nature — with currently little noted pattern or consistency outside environmental influence.[15](javascript:;) As a result of the cessation of the Red Brook mine's previous operations, and the instatement of SCP-8987's containment procedures, activation events have significantly decreased as of 1967.
KNOW/REMEMBER  
that SCP-8987 is  
not ALIVE.
During an activation event, SCP-8987 will appear to "bleed". The resultant liquid is red, with a consistency similar to sap, and ontokinetically unstable. Once released, it will then flow down the tree and along its roots, and solidify after an indeterminate amount of time. It is theorized that this bleeding and solidifying has caused SCP-8987 to "grow", and that disturbances from the Summit Anthracite mining operation caused its gradual expansion throughout the mine.
It has also been found that the petrified wood that makes up SCP-8987 is a powerful conduit for ontokinetic energy,[16](javascript:;) and likely the reason for the severity behind activation events. The destabilization of reality from the leaves routes through the root system, resulting in effects being widespread throughout Red Brook Mine.

# RUNS RED PROCEDURE
**As penned by Director Julian Eden**
![runsred.png](https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-8987/runsred.png)
RUNS RED is a SECONDARY CONTAINMENT CLASS utilized to indicate  
anomalies created by SCP-8987 activation events. This CLASS also means the anomaly is to be handled WITH CARE/CASE-BY-CASE by Site-898.
In a situation in which SCP-8987 has undergone an activation event, Site-898 must follow the RUNS RED Procedure, which includes the following instructions:
* * *
1\. Upon receiving notification from OROGENESIS that significant seismic activity has occurred, all staff are to be on standby while the Seismology Sector works for confirmation.
2\. Upon confirmation of an activation event, MTF Gamma-89 — or any sufficiently trained personnel[17](javascript:;) — are to be deployed into the Red Brook Mine.
3\. Enter the Red Brook Mine, seal the gate behind. Have personnel on standby at the entrance in case of emergency. Any remaining staff should remain within the Site until the Procedure's conclusion.
4\. Locate the anomaly. Do not split up.
5\. Determine the nature of the anomaly:  
**Event**  
**Object**  
**Entity**
6\. Act accordingly:  
If the anomaly is an **event** , let it run its course.  
If the anomaly is an **object** , determine its properties in the safest manner possible and retrieve it.  
If the anomaly is an **entity** , attempt to make contact. If the entity displays sapience, attempt containment diplomatically. If the entity does not display sapience, apprehend by force.
7\. The Containment Wing lies beneath Site-898's central building. Due to the RUNS RED Procedure, there is an entrance to it linked within the mine. Secure the gate and enter. Close behind.
8\. If applicable, you are to place the retrieved anomaly within one of the available holding cells.
9\. Upon confirmation, personnel can now depart from the Site and the mine entrance can be unsealed.
10\. The anomaly will be processed in due time.
11\. Prick your finger on the needle in the Containment Wing.[18](javascript:;)
* * *
Though wonderful, the beast beneath our feet is a unpredictable one. Do not forget that, do not grow comfortable up above and forget what is below.
Do not let the brook run red with our blood.
— Director Julian Eden, Department of Geology
