Special Containment Procedures:

 Åby Parish has been purchased and shuttered by the SCP Foundation. All communication with SCP-8999 must be approved by Research Group-8999 before initiated. Received communication from SCP-8999 is to be scanned and archived.

Seismic activity caused by SCP-8999 is subject to standard Foundation cover-up protocol.

Description:

 SCP-8999 refers to entities, unknown in number, presumably located in a vast, subterranean cavern system 35 meters below the Åby Parish, an Evangelical Lutheran church in Kalmar, Sweden.

While SCP-8999 have not been physically observed, their existence has been documented through extensive communication with the SCP Foundation. SCP-8999 are sapient and capable of articulating themselves through symbols and pictographs.

This communication has occurred exclusively through a modified dumbwaiter lift system constructed in the parish basement. Attempts to record footage of SCP-8999 by attaching a camera or surveillance drone to the lift have been unsuccessful. Further communication with the entities has indicated that they possess a desire to remain unseen, and are aware of the presence of cameras.

SCP-8999 possesses a degree of control over seismic activity in the surrounding area through unknown means, and have been responsible for tremors reaching magnitudes of up to 7.0 on the Richter Scale. These events exclusively occur as a result of dissatisfaction with communication between SCP-8999 and the Foundation.

SCP-8999 are largely disinterested in communication that does not involve or center around food.

Addendum.8999.1:

 Discovery

Åby Parish

SCP-8999 were discovered by Father Zakarias Öberg, the presiding priest at Åby Parish sometime during the late 20th century. According to his memoirs, Öberg began communication with the entities after hearing noise coming from a fault-line that had opened in the parish basement after seismic activity. Believing it to be the result of individuals trapped underground, Öberg began lowering food and supplies via a pulley system. While the food and drink were accepted, any inedible materials were returned to the surface. Over a period of time, Öberg established a communication system using paper and pen, and discerned that SCP-8999 were not human, instead referring to them in his writings as “trolls”.

Öberg maintained a relationship with SCP-8999 through the remainder of his life, frequently feeding the entities and constructing a more sophisticated lift to deliver their food. On 2023/9/18, Öberg died of natural causes. In his last memoir, Öberg entrusted the care of SCP-8999 to his nephew, Emil Öberg. An excerpt, translated from Swedish, has been included below.

It is through my faith in the Lord, the Shepard, and His flock that any worries are put at ease. God’s grace shall continue to uplift this humble rock as a beacon of love, kindness, and generosity, even without my presence.

And to Emil, my beloved nephew: keep mind of those who live beneath our feet, as they are God’s creations as well. Please, take care of my dear trolls. They are not christenized, but I would read passages from the Lord's book to them and could feel their spirits quelled. They are quite intelligent, and receptive to simple symbols, such as the question mark, and the arrow.

However, their appetites are ravenous and particular. I have left detailed instructions on the recipes I have prepared for them throughout the years. My judgment has led me to believe that it is in their best interests to be fed on a light diet of fruits and vegetables, which they cannot find underground. They have shown great appreciation for this nourishment, though remain particular in its preparation and presentation. Please consult the instructions I have prepared for you.

Within days, intense, prolonged seismic activity occurred in Kalmar. Foundation investigation quickly discovered the existence of SCP-8999 through a law enforcement report filed by Emil Öberg, Zakarias’s nephew, who purported that the origin of the activity was occurring as a result of the lift in the parish basement.

An excerpt from the Foundation interview with Emil has been included below.

Emil Öberg:

 He was a priest, so I wasn’t expecting a fortune or anything, but, uh…

Agent Palmer:

 You inherited his trolls.

Emil Öberg:

 I guess, man. I couldn’t find that cookbook at all. Like, how was I supposed to know what they ate?

Agent Palmer:

 So what were you feeding them?

Emil Öberg:

 Uh, some kebab. Pizza, a little liquor, that sort of thing. They sent up this.

Emil Öberg:

 I don't think they liked it.

Agent Palmer:

 Hm.

Emil Öberg:

 I don’t even know what they wanted. I sent down some fruits, like he said, but they sent those back up too. I guess that’s when they realized something was up because the earthquakes started right after. I’m really sorry, sir. I’ve never fed trolls before.

Agent Palmer:

 That's quite alright, Emil.

Emil Öberg was amnesticized, and following cover-up operations of the seismic activity in Kalmar, the Foundation seized Åby Parish and began communication with SCP-8999.

 Communication Log

The Foundation established communication with SCP-8999 on 2023/9/24, using drawings and symbols that were sent down the lift via paper. A sheet of blank paper and a pen were also included to prompt a response.

After some debate among researchers, it was determined that SCP-8999 were requesting an eggplant. A bundle of eggplants were sent down the lift. They were promptly sent back to the surface. Minor seismic activity occurred shortly after.

A platter of the above items alongside several other similarly shaped foods were delivered to SCP-8999. All were rejected. Seismic activity occurred shortly after.

Communication with SCP-8999 was paused in order to better assess its requests. A variety of foods were tested and met with rejection and subsequent seismic activity in the following weeks. On 2023/10/17, SCP-8999 initiated communication, marking the first time it had done so.

SCP-8999 were provided with a box containing a collection of images of a variety of foods and objects, and were prompted to choose among them. The images were returned without communication. Seismic activity continued, intensifying in magnitude.

Communication with SCP-8999 was postponed indefinitely, though the entities continued to initiate conversation without response.

SCP-8999:

In an effort to stop the intense seismic activity, SCP-8999’s head researcher, Dr. Perrelli, offered to travel down the lift and attempt to further SCP-8999’s communicative ability. As the cover-up of seismic activity proved costly for the Foundation, and little headway was made in determining SCP-8999’s desires, Dr. Perrelli’s request was approved by his site’s Board of Experimentation.

On 2023/10/28, Dr. Perrelli descended the lift. Boxes of communicative tools were sent down immediately after, including pictures, graphs, and writing utensils.

Communication with Dr. Perrelli was lost shortly after his descent. All communication with SCP-8999 ceased for three days. On 2023/10/31, SCP-8999 reopened communications.
