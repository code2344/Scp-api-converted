Fun Fact: This is not an image of SCP-7078.

Item #:

 SCP-7078

Object Class:

 Safe

Special Containment Procedures:

 SCP-7078 has been acquired by the Foundation for the purposes of containment. The building has been obfuscated with scaffolding and construction tarps to conceal its nature. Foundation personnel are advised to refrain from referring to the location as a "museum" — while triggering the object's effect is relatively harmless, an undesirable loss of productivity can occur. The length of all documentation on SCP-7078 is to be kept to a minimum in the interest of readability.

Description:

 SCP-7078 is the former Tiverton Children's Museum located in Tiverton

1

, Rhode Island,

2

 United States. The building exhibits infohazardous properties

3

 — when individuals refer to the building as a "museum," they are compelled to list additional information. At first, these digressions

4

 will relate to the topic at hand (whether it be the museum itself or another subject) and consist mostly of factual, if unnecessary, clarifications. This effect can occur through both verbal and textual mediums

5

 and is not limited by the speaker's knowledge (or lack thereof) about the topic. Affected individuals are not forced to continue speaking — conversations in which the museum was acknowledged can and do cease, and the compulsion will fade after an indeterminate amount of time (estimated 1-2 hours).

6

For every successive referral to the building's nature as a museum, the incongruency and length of these digressions tends to increase. Affected individuals will start discussing topics wholly unsuited

7

 to their previous conversation — many of these asides will be incorrect,

8

 nonsensical, or otherwise irrelevant.

Addendum 7078.1: Discovery

SCP-7078's anomalous effect first manifested on July 19th, 2017. During a community picnic held at the museum, an argument between a staff

9

 member and a married couple occurred over a parking space.

10

 Witnesses reported that the husband pointed at the museum and accused the institution's

11

 administration of hiring unqualified employees. Immediately following this mention, he began to discuss the building's history,

12

 listing factoids such as its date of construction, how long the museum had been open,

13

 and who founded the institution.

14

When his partner

15

 inquired why he was discussing

16

 the museum in such detail, she too began to exhibit the anomalous effect. This caused a cascading

17

 effect, wherein confused onlookers would be drawn into the debate after trying to ascertain why the building

18

 had become a topic of discussion. Eventually, the couple grew frustrated with the conversation and left the premises.

19

 The remaining guests, cognizant

20

 of their inability to hold logical conversations, intentionally kept themselves silent.

21

The incident

22

 was recorded live by local news station WJAR 10.

23

 Following the broadcast, a Foundation

24

 containment team was dispatched to annex the site and administer amnestics

25

 to affected individuals. A cover story was disseminated, attributing the events seen on the broadcast to a hoax staged by internet influencers.

26

Currently, a Foundation disinformation

27

 and infohazard management

28

campaign is underway in Tiverton and surrounding areas to suppress knowledge of the building's former status as a museum.

29

 The prevailing public

30

 narrative will be that the building was a former library,

31

 and the interior

32

 of the now-abandoned building will be redecorated to support this idea.

. Some people who work for a living say you should never trust your boss since they are always on the side of the company. Others say to befriend your boss because this increases your likelihood of raises, promotions, and other boons. A tough choice to make!

29

. Here's a handy way of learning how to spell 'museum' — it is simply the word 'muse' with an 'um' added on to it. Easy to remember, right? 'Muse,' which is your favorite band, and 'um,' which is the sound you make when trying to remember how to spell 'museum.'

30

. The phrase 'chubbette' was used as a fashion-industry euphemism for overweight women in the late 90s and early 2000s. The term has since been superseded by 'plus-size' and similar terms.

. This is not a reference to another SCP object. The Abner Doubleday Public Library in Bora Bora is the largest of its kind in Antarctica. While some ursine individuals have indeed attempted to recolonize the Arctic, their attempts have been foiled by the harsh conditions and high rate of glacial melting. Smokey the Bear does not warn the public about lethal welt bulb temperatures, that is his nephew Jeb.

32

. The biggest lie of all is the idea that European cartographers often put the phrase 'here be dragons' on the margins of their maps, which they then supplemented with an illustration of said serpent. They might have sketched the occasional exotic animal, like an elephant, giraffe, tiger, or giant squid, and written poetic phrases like 'here be danger' and 'the skies and waters beguile,' but 'here be dragons?' Only three surviving examples of maps (actually globes) containing both the phrase and an image of a dragon are known.

33

. "The museum is not a baleful entity. Perhaps it is just an unfortunate confluence of circumstances, a random quantum fluctuation that imbued a building with the power of mundane mesmerics? Further research is required. What? No, I never said that. 'Mesmeric' isn't even a word, you're thinking of 'memetics.' We choose to go to the Moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard. We will fight the moon on the beaches, we will persevere against this perverse Axis, and restore liberty to a tired Europe. People with new ideas, people with the faintest capacity for saying something new, are extremely few in number, extraordinarily so, in fact. We will boldly go where no man has gone before. Thank you." — Site 48 paralinguistics department head Dr. Gwen Stefani
