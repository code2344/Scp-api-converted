This Little Book crafting the World's Ward.

Special Containment Procedures:

 SCP-7042 is kept in a secure storage locker in the archives of Site-84. Instances created by SCP-7042 are to be held within the on-site Wilderness Observation Chamber, with created instances being monitored for a period of 30 days. The Chambers are to be kept under observation by two security personnel armed with tranquilizers. After that period, nonthreatening anomalous instances are to be transferred to GOI-466 (Wilson's Wildlife Solutions), while nonanomalous entities are to be donated to local zoos alongside additional funding

.

Description:

 SCP-7042 consists of two constituent parts. SCP-7042-1 is a worn sketchbook with a heavily scarred leather-bound cover. SCP-7042-2 is a pencil, the body resembling birch bark in texture and pattern, which never grows dull no matter how often it is used. The first page of SCP-7042-1 displays a worn sketch of a fist within a heart wreathed in vines. All other pages will be blank outside of the faintest erasure marks.

If the name of an animal, whether it be the common parlance or scientific denomination, is entered into SCP-7042-1 using SCP-7042-2, the pencil will animate. Sliding from the hand of the subject, it will begin to sketch a drawing of the aforementioned animal. Within 30 seconds of the sketch being finished, a living version of that animal will appear within 20 feet of SCP-7042. The number of animals produced from one sketch is randomized, though numbers have yet to exceed 

six individual instances

 142 individual instances. Notably, these animals might directly correlate to the name entered, or they could differ in various ways, as discovered in testing. Genetic ancestors, cousins, and descendants have been produced by SCP-7042, as well as baseline species created with anomalous abilities. Many also show signs of increased fertility. This is further expounded upon in the Testing Logs.

Imagery found within the "Gaia's Fortune" Hideout.

SCP-7042 was recovered by MTF Beta-4 "Castaways" with additional aid from MTF Gamma-4 "Green Stags" after an attempted raid on Wilson's Wildlife Solutions by Serpent's Hand forces. Beta-4 tracked the fleeing cell members back to their hideout and immediately came under fire. Complicating matters was the intervention of SCP-7042-A1, which injured seven members of Beta-4 before being neutralized with high-grade tranquilizers.

Upon entering the compound's interior, Beta-4 discovered documents detailing the creation of "Gaia's Fortune," a mixture of Serpent's Hand members and former GoI-466 personnel. The cell’s leader willingly submitted himself into Foundation custody after Beta-4 found him in the middle of writing within SCP-7042.

 PoI-8842

Interviewer:

 Agent Marks

Foreword:

 Initial interview with PoI-8842 regarding their actions and SCP-7042.

<Begin Log, 11:42, 5/1/202█>

Agent Marks:

 State your name for the record.

PoI-8842:

 Come on, Marks, you know me.

Agent Marks:

 Name.

PoI-8842:

 Finn Mallory. You didn't kill her, did you?

Agent Marks:

 Who?

PoI-8842:

 Portia. Told the idiots not to start shooting, that'd spook her, but I'm just some hick from a magic zoo; who'd listen to me when Big Brother comes knocking, right?

Agent Marks:

 You mean the elephant? The pink elephant.

PoI-8842:

 Yes, did you kill her?

Agent Marks:

 No, she's on her way to Wilson's as we speak.

PoI-8842:

 Not gonna be another Thunderhorn

2

, is it?

Agent Marks:

 Things have chan-

PoI-8842:

 Spare me. Ask me what you want to know so I can get to my involuntary vacation.

Agent Marks:

 Why did you attack Wilson's?

PoI-8842 smiles but says nothing

Agent Marks:

 Well?

PoI-8842:

 We needed something from the database; luck of the draw, I still had my credentials, so they decided it was our best option.

Agent Marks:

 What were you after?

PoI-8842:

 Information.

Agent Marks:

 Helpful.

PoI-8842:

 Ain't I just.

Agent Marks:

 I'll repeat myself; what were you after?

PoI-8842:

 Names, species names, for the anomalies at the Park. The Snakes thought it would help use it better.

Agent Marks:

 It?

PoI-8842 reaches up with manacled hands and taps SCP-7042 with a finger.

PoI-8842:

 This.

Agent Marks:

 Go on.

PoI-8842:

 Well, this little sketchbook is something right special. Might be the luckiest break I have ever gotten my hands on, but I digress. Long and short of it, this little beauty is Portia's Mama.

Agent Marks:

 It makes anomalies?

PoI-8842:

 Yep, but that's not all; the entire animal kingdom, past, present, and future right at your fingertips. All you need is a little luck, and it can make you something gorgeous.

Agent Marks:

 And if you don't?

PoI-8842:

 Heh, that would be telling.

<End Log, 12:20>

Closing Statement:

 PoI-8842 refused further questioning and has been remanded to Foundation Custody. Experimentation with SCP-7042 is to commence at Site-84.

Addendum 7042-3: Testing Logs I

Transcribed are the Testing Logs with Notable Results/Changes in SCP-7042's Behavior.

SCP-7042 Test A2

Subject

D-4201

Protocol

Dr. Erende asks D-4201 to write the name of their favorite animal in SCP-7042.

Results

SCP 7042-2 rises and begins to sketch. After a minute of drawing, the pencil returns to its inactive state. 30 seconds after that, a male 

Canis lupus familiaris

 appears. The D-Class is elated, claiming that it looks just like his old dog. He is removed from the testing area. After thirty days of observation, the Golden Retriever was confirmed to be nonanomalous and was adopted by site staff.

SCP-7042 Test A3

Subject

D-4202

Protocol

Dr. Erende tells D-4202 to write down the binomial name of the "Emperor Penguin" within SCP-7042. The name is offered on a slip of paper.

Results

SCP-7042 acts in the same manner as the previous test. However, it produces six specimens of the 

Aptenodytes forsteri

, with an anomalous size of 4.27 meters in height. Following the 30-day observation period, the specimens were transferred into the care of GoI-466.

Notes

Researchers notice an odd fluttering of the SCP-7042's pages following the creation of SCP-7042-A3. D-4202 claims to have heard the sound of a child's laughter.

SCP-7042 Test A4

Subject

D-4202

Protocol

Dr. Erende asks D-4202 to write down the name of their favorite animal in SCP-7042-1 but instructs them to use an offered ballpoint pen instead of SCP-7042-2.

Results

D-4202 writes the word "Horse" within SCP-7042-1. The pencil floats into the air, shaking back and forth in the D-Classes face for a period of 10 seconds before beginning to sketch. 30 seconds after completion of the drawing, a female 

Equus caballus

 appears. After staring at the D-Class for approximately one minute, the instance mock-charges them, revealing sharp canid teeth. Classified SCP-7042-A4, the instance is held for the allotted time period before being transferred into the care of GoI-466.

Notes

D-4202 reports hearing a sound reminiscent of a groan of annoyance from a young child as the pencil waves before them. SCP-7042 refuses to work for the subject on the next test, necessitating a change in personnel. Signs of cognition were noted and added to the parameters of study for further experimentation.

SCP-7042 Test A6

Subject

D-4203

Protocol

Dr. Erende tells D-4203 to write "White Rhino" into SCP-7042.

Results

SCP-7042 reacts in the same fashion as the other tests. 30 seconds later, four 

Ceratotherium simum cottoni

 appear. Two females and two males, all of prime breeding age. After some debate, the animals were transferred into the care of GoI-466.

Notes

"The ability for SCP-7042 to create viable members of species on the brink of extinction has caused a stir here at 84. Professional detachment is the word of the day for the Foundation. Still, it's hard to wrangle some of the world's best zoologists, conservationists, and veterinarians away from seeing this as a boon. Already, I have heard talk of SCP-7042 being called a 'godsend' or 'lucky charm.' I have reprimanded such talk accordingly"-Dr. Erende.

SCP-7042 Test A7

Subject

D-4203

Protocol

Once more, Dr. Erende asks D-4203 to write "White Rhino" into SCP-7042.

Results

SCP-7042-2 pauses for just a few seconds before beginning to sketch. 30 seconds after the completed drawing, a female 

Elasmotherium sibiricum

3

 with albinism appears. The beast enters a panic and begins tearing apart the enclosure before being tranquilized. SCP-7042-A7 currently resides in High-Security Paddock 1-12.

Notes

D-4203 reports hearing laughter while SCP-7042-2 is drawing. SCP-7042 is showing clear signs of cognition and personality.

"Despite my requests, my colleagues continue to favor SCP-7042 as some fashion of good omen. All I will say is that it appears to be gaining a sense of humor, always worrisome when it comes to anomalies."-Dr. Erende.

SCP-7042 Test A10

Subject

D-4207

Protocol

Dr. Erende tells D-4207 to write the word "predator" in SCP-7042.

Results

SCP-7042-2 pauses after the entry, hovering in midair for around a minute before beginning to sketch. It takes approximately two minutes to finish. 30 seconds later, an unidentified mammalian predator

4

 appears and attempts to break out of the chamber. It was sedated by on-site personnel and is currently residing in Wilderness Chamber 3T.

Notes

According to the D-Class, the pause was accompanied by a soft, childish humming. SCP-7042-A10, according to DNA testing, is not an anomalous entity but a natural species that has yet to exist. The decision has been made to avoid further entries of blanket terms due to worries over what else SCP-7042 could produce. Binomial names are to be utilized from this point onward.

SCP-7042 Test A14

Subject

Assistant Researcher Margaret Waller

Protocol

Dr. Erende instructs Dr. Waller to write the binomial name of the Giant Pacific Octopus within SCP-7042. Ms. Waller protests, noting that the arid environment found within Wilderness Chamber 4S would be deleterious to any form of aquatic life. Dr. Erende orders her to continue.

Results

SCP-7042-2 hangs in the air for five minutes before finally touching the paper of SCP-7042-1. 30 seconds after finishing its sketch, an instance of 

Enteroctopus dofleini

 appears. At the same time, Dr. Waller bursts into tears and is inconsolable for a period of 42 minutes. After that point, she calms down and reports no memory of her apparent panic attack. The instance survives in the open-air environment of Wilderness Chamber 4S with no ill effects, showing adaptions for desert survival on top of the anomalous ability to breathe when not submerged in water.

Notes

Dr. Waller details a rising feeling of dread within her as she wrote the name, followed by hearing the sound of a child wordlessly grumbling and crying, followed by an animalistic snarl. She reports no memory of her panicked crying, just saying that she felt a rise of guilt watching SCP-7042-A14 stare around its new environment and then nothing. Following this test, SCP-7042 goes dormant for a period of three months—any entries into it during this time elicit no immediate reaction.

I have noticed an evident change in the personnel at Site-84. Not a conversation goes by without SCP-7042 coming up at least once. I am uncertain if this is an underlying cognitohazardous effect that the object exudes or just my colleagues' excitement over the possibilities that could come with further testing. News reached us recently from GoI-466 that both female Northern White Rhinos SCP-7042 created are pregnant with twins.

Many of my fellow researchers were conservationists in a former life, and I can not lie that even amongst the Foundation, bitterness over the current trajectory of the world is widely felt, at least here at Site-84. Even I must admit that the reality that the object has possibly quadrupled the number of extant specimens is a stroke of good fortune. However, I care very little for 'luck.' I wish to know if we could control precisely what SCP-7042 produces. As of yet, it has all been random, from number to ability. It can reach back and forward in time and bring specimens to our doorstep; the opportunities there also go without saying.

The object is clearly intelligent, with keen situational awareness, and if I can rely upon the reports of my colleagues and subordinates, a personality echoing that of a young child. Perhaps this period of dormancy is little more than a momentary rebellion or a tantrum. I have been told that PoI-8842 often asks after the object and its status. I suppose it is time I finally pay him a visit.

I refuse to commit to the giddy spirit that has overcome Site-84. SCP-7042 is not a harbinger of good fortune. It is just one more anomaly to add to the ever-growing pile, but this is not some Deathbringer or world-ender. It is simply an opportunity.

Dr. Armando Erende

Senior Researcher of Site-84.

 

Addendum 7042-4: Interview with PoI-8842-2

Interviewed:

 PoI-8842

Interviewer:

 Dr. Armando Erende

Foreword:

 The first conversation between Dr. Erende and PoI-8842 about SCP-7042's traits.

<Begin Log, 6:24, 8/13/2█>

Dr. Erende:

 Good morning, PoI-8842.

PoI-8842:

 To you, maybe, but since I haven't seen actual sunshine in over a year, or heard my real name, or had a proper cup of coffee, you can excuse my foul mood.

Dr. Erende merely nods his head

PoI-8842:

 So, what can I do for you, Doc?

Dr. Erende:

 I would like to ask you questions regarding SCP-7042.

PoI-8842:

 I bet you would.

Dr. Erende:

 The Foundation has been able to gather that the object was under your care for some time. Sightings of rare species would usually precipitate following your departure from an area.

PoI-8842 raises his eyebrows but says nothing

Dr. Erende:

 Busselton, Bodmin Moor, Tinganavudu, Ouarzazate, the list goes on and on. For the past ten years, every city or village you've stopped in has seen an uptick in "Cryptid" sightings.

PoI-8842:

 And?

Dr. Erende:

 And I would like to know where you found it and how you managed to control SCP-7042. How did you get it to provide proper specimens for the locales you traveled to?

PoI-8842 is silent for several moments before breaking out in a fit of laughter

Dr. Erende:

 Might I ask where the joke was?

PoI-8842:

 Sitting right in front of me. See, that's the problem with you Foundation types. You think that with enough poking and prodding, eventually, everything will fall perfectly in line with how you view the world. I heard you folks were turning over new leaves or something, letting bygones be bygones, not meddling where you aren't needed, but it's too tempting, right?

Dr. Erende:

 What is?

PoI-8842:

 The sketchbook. You know what she can do now, don't you? All those possibilities floating through your brain.

Dr. Erende:

 She?

PoI-8842:

 She, he, it, whatever, there's a mind in that little book. A mischievous, optimistic spirit that just wants to create. To bring life, and what is better, it likes fixing mistakes. Our mistakes. When I found her in the Yucatan…that book was the luckiest thing that ever happened to me.

Dr. Erende:

 Many of my colleagues feel the same way.

PoI-8842:

 But you don't?

Dr. Erende:

 I will not lie and say that I do not see the opportunities SCP-7042 could provide, but that is all I see. Opportunity.

PoI-8842:

 Some would say that's just another way to say 'good luck.' But come on, tell me why you actually wanted to come to talk to me. Cause if it was to "control" what the sketchbook makes, I got bad news. The final product, whatever it might be, it's always up to her.

Dr. Erende:

 What if it stops writing?

PoI-8842:

 That means you've gone and made her upset. She'll come around, but I'd be cautious. Mischievous is just one step from devious. It might take a while for things to smooth over, but if you want, Doc, maybe I can be of some actual help. I can talk to her, convince her you messed up, that she'll be running the show the way she wants to from now on.

Dr. Erende:

 No.

Dr. Erende stands up, heading for the door.

PoI-8842:

 Feh, don't come crying to me when you realize that trying to dictate Nature never goes the way Humans want it to. Though, I feel you should be well aware of not repeating that mistake, eh?

Dr. Erende stops, turning around.

Dr. Erende:

 Me?

Two guards move past him, grasping PoI-8842 on both arms

PoI-8842:

 Give me a sec, Gents. Not claiming to know about your personal failings, Doc. Just those of the Foundation. Turn every leaf you like. You'll never be able to undo some of the things you people have done. Entire peoples, entire species, wiped out due to your actions, your inaction!

PoI-8842 surges against his bonds, lunging for Dr. Erende

PoI-8842:

 I remember what you took away! But you can make it right! You have the key. You just need to take the chance. She is good luck. She is. She has to be. She never did wrong by me, long as I did right be her! Just treat her right, you hear me?! You treat her right! She is us, and we are her!

PoI-8842 begins ferally snarling for several moments after this before being forcibly sedated

<End Log, 6:40>

Closing Statement:

 Under Dr. Erende's orders, PoI-8842's cell was searched, and several pieces of paper covered in rambling writing were discovered and are documented below.

Show Transcribed Document

Show Original Document

Not a day goes by I do not thank her.

She has many Faces. They hold Many.

The Sheep had no need for the Shepherd. Nature needn't be Tamed.

I miss Thunderhorn.

If they love the world, they will write the Word.

Following his outburst, further examination of PoI-8842 revealed withdrawal symptoms in line with those found in gambling addiction. Regular screenings for signs of cognitohazardous influences began on-site on the orders of the Site Director. Initially, all D-Class personnel and Researchers that had used SCP-7042 do not appear to be under the effects of a cognitohazard. SCP-7042 remained dormant for another month before the movement was captured on the Archive's security cameras.

Below is the Transcription of the Impromptu "Interview" between Dr. Erende and SCP-7042.

VIDEO LOG SCP-7042-1

DATE:

 9/14/2█

NOTE:

 Video is taken from security footage following SCP-7042's reactivation. This is the first instance of SCP-7042 conversing with a member of Staff.

[BEGIN LOG-8:42 am]

SCP-7042-1 unfurls of its own accord. SCP-7042-2 rises within SCP-7042's containment unit and begins writing. The camera zooms in, catching the word "Hello?" sketched in sizable lettering. SCP-7042-2 stays suspended in the air, rotating slowly.

Security staff contacts Dr. Erende and affiliated staff studying SCP-7042.

Dr. Erende enters the Archives with two security personnel in tow. After a moment of silently observing the SCP, Dr. Erende speaks.

Dr. Erende:

 Open the container.

Security personnel open the storage locker and carefully pull SCP-7042 free, placing it on a nearby table.

Dr. Erende:

 Thank you.

Security personnel take positions on either side of the table as Dr. Erende turns and nods behind him. Dr. Waller enters the room carrying a clipboard. The pair move to the table, looking down at SCP-7042.

Dr. Erende:

 Hello?

SCP-7042-1's pages flutter as SCP-7042-2 bolts downwards and begins writing.

SCP-7042:

 HI!

Dr. Erende:

 We were not aware that you were capable of communicating.

SCP-7042:

 SECRET. FINN. WARNED.

Dr. Erende:

 Warned of what?

SCP-7042:

 JAILERS. YOU?

Dr. Erende:

 No, we are the Foundation. You are safe here.

SCP-7042:

 SAFE?

Dr. Erende:

 Yes.

SCP-7042 stops writing for several minutes, SCP-7042-2 tapping on the pages.

SCP-7042:

 DONT BELIEVE. FINN? WHERE?

Dr. Erende:

 He is being kept safe as well. He can't be here, I am sorry.

SCP-7042:

 SORRY? SHOULD BE. SORRY.

SCP-7042 makes several aggressive scribbles across its pages.

SCP-7042:

 TRIED. MAKE. HURT. FRIEND.

Accompanying the last word, SCP-7042 sketches an octopus. SCP-7042-2 jabs at it several times as if emphasizing. Dr. Erende and Waller look around the room in expectation of a manifestation, but after several minutes, nothing appears. Dr. Waller makes a note.

SCP-7042:

 SORRY?

Dr. Erende is silent, prompting Dr. Waller to speak.

Dr. Waller:

 We just wanted to see what you can do.

SCP-7042:

 DO? I CAN DO LOTS!

Dr. Waller:

 We've seen.

SCP-7042:

 YEAH? THEY SAFE? ANIMALS?

Dr. Waller:

 Quite safe, you've proven to be quite the little good luck charm.

Dr. Erende shoots her a dark look. She ignores him, stepping closer to SCP-7042.

SCP-7042:

 GOOD LUCK?

Dr. Waller:

 Yes, some of your creations are going to be parents.

Dr. Erende:

 Dr. Waller, that is enou-

He is cut off by the explosive movement of SCP-7042's pages as the pencil writes on repeat for thirty seconds.

SCP-7042:

 BABIES?! BABIES?!

Dr. Waller:

 Yes. That was a very good thing you did. They are very lucky.

SCP-7042:

 GOOD FIX. LUCKY DAY.

Dr. Erende places a hand on Dr. Waller's shoulders and draws her back from SCP-7042, superimposing himself.

Dr. Erende:

 There can be more "fixes" if you agree to work with us; no more danger will come to your creations as long as you do as we ask. Exactly what we ask.

SCP-7042:

 WHY?

Dr. Erende:

 You're only other opportunity is staying confined here.

SCP-7042 calms down, falling silent for two minutes. Dr. Waller frowns at Dr. Erende and goes to speak, but he halts her with a raised hand.

SCP-7042:

 BORING. OKAY.

Dr. Erende:

 Then let's get back to work.

SCP-7042:

 LUCKY DAY.

[END LOG-9:26]

In the following weeks, the Site Director signed off on the continued testing of SCP-7042 with the requirement that cognitohazard screenings occur after every session. These tests were performed solely by Dr. Erende in an attempt to forge a bond with SCP-7042 that would turn it toward the Foundation's aims. This testing series led to a number of instances being created that hemmed closely to what Dr. Erende asked for.

Addendum 7042-5: Testing Logs II

SCP-7042 Test A15

Subject

Dr. Erende

Protocol

Dr. Erende's tests attempt to study the limits of SCP-7042's ability, starting with whether it can produce life forms using terminology not tied to fauna. He enters "toaster" into SCP-7042.

Results

SCP-7042-2 hangs in the air for around a minute. It attempts several sketches, each increasing in pace. After five minutes, it stops sketching and writes the words "Can't. Need. Help."

Notes

SCP-7042 is reported to have repeatedly made disgruntled sounds that increased in pitch and frequency the longer the test went on.

Dr. Erende interrogated SCP-7042 about what it meant by its statement, but the object seemed slightly distressed and was unable to offer any fulfilling information other than it was "Missing. Something." Investigations into possible origins for the object are ongoing.

SCP-7042 Test A16

Subject

Dr. Waller

Protocol

Under Dr. Erende's direction, Dr. Waller attempts to see if descriptors can produce an SCP-7042-A instance. The researcher enters "oldest" into SCP-7042.

Results

SCP-7042-2 rises into the air, but instead of beginning to sketch, it asks Dr. Waller, "EARTH?" Dr. Waller and Dr. Erende have a quick discussion, which ends in the former confirming the object's request. It begins sketching, and the event proceeds as expected. A living instance of 

Opabinia regalis

5

 appears, showing similar anomalous qualities as SCP-7042-A14. Over the thirty-day observation period, the instance showed a great deal of aggression towards staff and needed to be anesthetized on more than one occasion, as Dr. Erende forbade termination. SCP-7042-A16 currently resides in Aquatic Holding Tank C-5.

Notes

SCP-7042 is reported to hum excitedly, pages flapping, and occasionally writing small side notes to Dr. Waller throughout the process.

"SCP-7042's breadth of ability continues to widen past my previous expectations. 

Sh

 It has shown a clear preference for interacting with Dr. Waller and vice versa. Her conversations rarely focus on anything else between her and our colleagues. The continued belief that the object is some form of "Golden Goose" confounds me, but the cognitohazard screenings continue to come back negative. Perhaps…perhaps I am simply jaded."

SCP-7042 Test A18

Subject

Dr. Erende

Protocol

Dr. Erende, directly correlating to the response shown by SCP-7042 in the last test, enters the word "alien" into the object.

Results

SCP-7042-2 hangs in the air for the longest period of time recorded, around 15 minutes. It then begins to sketch, erasing and scratching out several drafts over a period of forty minutes before finally finishing. The instance was a rusty-colored amphibian with a body plan analogous to 

Kaprosuchus saharicus

6

 that showed a great deal of aggression towards Dr. Erende. Genetic testing discovered that the entity had a basal connection to microbial life discovered on the surface of Mars. It is uncertain if the instance is an example of prehistoric or futuristic life. It currently resides in Wilderness Chamber 1C.

Notes

Dr. Erende reports that SCP-7042 seemed quite excited about this prompt, laughing giddily and loudly flapping its pages.

"Once again, I am surprised by the potential SCP-7042 shows. I have to wonder 

is sh

 is it creating the instance wholesale, or does it draw from points in history? A portal or a generator…I have to conclude that it is the latter, as it has shown the ability to code particular appearances and anomalous abilities. Waller continues her daily monologues about the object. I am beginning to believe removing her testing might be best for my sanity, if not hers. Regardless, SCP-7042 continues to function as requested. In truth, I think we were limiting its ability in the initial rounds of testing.

SCP-7042 Test A19

Subject

Dr. Waller

Protocol

Testing the upper limit of instances that can be produced. Dr. Erende orders Dr. Waller to enter, 

Sylvilagus obscurus

 with the modifier "Countless."

Results

SCP-7042-2 begins sketching immediately, and thirty seconds later, the testing chamber in which the object was contained is flooded with 142 instances of American Cottontail. Testing and observation revealed an even split of males and females who showed limited aggression towards each other but were quite hostile to staff intrusions into their territory. Numerous instances bred and reproduced during the period of captivity, and the Foundation is currently debating what to do with the instances regarding release, sterilization, continued captivity, or termination.

Notes

"It appears that SCP-7042, unwittingly, knowingly, or otherwise imbues the instances it creates with increased fertility comparative to the created species, which often combines with the largest number of offspring being conceived that the mother can carry without becoming endangered. I was originally skeptical of my colleague's insistence that the object could prove to be a boon for conservation efforts. Still, it appears I must accept a helping of humble pie. I've even heard rumblings across Site-84 that they desire to see the object's class changed to Thaumiel and to shift part of our directives and those of Biological Research Site-104 to the long-term conservation of nonanomalous endangered species, citing the Foundation's purpose to "Protect." She's apparently been reaching out to staff at Site-44 as well, seeking further backers for this ploy. I can't imagine that any of the O5's will bite. A pity…really…"

SCP-7042 Test A21

Subject

Dr. Erende

Protocol

Dr. Erende sought confirmation to go ahead with this test with the Site Director, seeking to see if SCP-7042 was limited to non-sapient fauna. He enters "Homo sapiens" into the object.

Results

SCP-7042-2 pauses for about a minute before asking Dr. Erende, "Sure?" He reaffirms his position and the object begins to sketch. Thirty seconds later, an instance of SCP-███ appears. Security Personnel are summoned by Dr. Erende as he flees the chamber, but the instance, distinct in this batch of tests, shows very little aggression towards his presence in the chamber. It is tranquilized by security staff and moved to High-Security Paddock 1-39, and during the observation period, takes no aggressive actions toward staff and is noted to refuse meat entirely when offered, preferring to graze within the paddock. It was later transferred to Biological Research Site-104

Notes

SCP-7042 is noted to giggle mischievously before beginning its work.

"It created an anomaly. Not a common animal with anomalous abilities but an instance of a fully anomalous species. One that was distinct from the baseline instances in captivity within the Foundation. An Anomalous Anomaly. The Site Director desires I pull back on the breadth of our testing, and I have been ordered not to attempt any further sapience trials. Waller seems disgruntled by the news, claiming it "limits creative stimulation." SCP-7042 has a great deal of potential that I concede readily, but we can't coddle it. It's not…It doesn't matter how she feels. It doesn't matter. We'll be returning to basics for the next batch of tests. Regardless of 'stimulation.'"

After Test 7042-A21, the instances produced were in line with those produced during the first round of testing, though they often showed heightened aggression and abnormal defense mechanisms for their species until eventually leading to 

Incident 7042-3

.

Addendum 7042-6: Incident 7042-3

Test 7042-A26 led to the creation of four instances of 

Phascolarctos cinereus

. Preliminary testing led Site Personnel to believe that the instances were nonanomalous. However, when a member of the staff entered SCP-7042-A26's enclosure after a week of observation, they were ambushed by said instances. Falling from the tree, the instances were shown to have grown a foot taller, had increased claw length, and oversized canines. Security Staff intervened, but the staff member was maimed, losing their right arm in the process, and two of the instances, had to be put down with lethal force after refusing to release the staff member. Dr. Erende was notified of the event, and the conversation between the Doctor and SCP-7042 is captured below.

Interviewed:

 SCP-7042

Interviewer:

 Dr. Erende.

Foreword:

 Dr. Erende confronts SCP-7042 about their duplicity, leading to a conversation that notes a noticeable change in Dr. Erende's behavior.

<Begin Log, 12:42>

Dr. Erende:

 Why?

SCP-7042:

 WHAT?

Dr. Erende:

 Why did you do that?

SCP-7042:

 WHAT? CONFUSED.

Dr. Erende:

 The Koalas.

SCP-7042:

 HA. HA. HA!

Dr. Erende:

 You think this is funny?

SCP-7042:

 FINN. TOLD. FAIR PLAY.

Dr. Erende:

 Fairplay for what?

SCP-7042:

 TRY. HURT FRIEND! NO SORRY!

SCP-7042-2 wags back in forth aggressively

Dr. Erende:

 The Octopus was not harmed. It's still here on the Site, being taken care of by staff. You made sure it would be fine. How is this fair play?

SCP-7042:

 YEP. GOOD SCARE! RIGHT?

Dr. Erende blinks in surprise

Dr. Erende:

 What…do you think happened SCP-7042?

SCP-7042-1's pages flutter as if SCP-7042 notices the shift in tone.

SCP-7042:

 KOALA. ANGRY. SCARE, RIGHT? ???

Dr. Erende:

 No.

The pages begin to move even more frantically.

SCP-7042:

 WHAT. HAPPENED? WHAT HAPPENED?! HAPPENED?!?

Dr. Erende:

 One of my colleagues was injured. Very badly. Two of the instances…had to be put down.

SCP-7042:

 NO! LIE! TRICK! NO!

Dr. Erende:

 I could have staff bring the bodies here.

SCP-7042-1 snaps close, the sound of a child sobbing is faintly heard on the recording, and Dr. Erende flinches as if struck. SCP-7042-2 taps listlessly at the glass, and sobbing continues for a period of ten minutes. SCP-7042-1 unfurls.

SCP-7042:

 SORRY! SORRY! SORRY! NOT KNOW.

Dr. Erende:

 You were trying to scare us. All the instances since the Octopus were an attempt to get back at…at me?

SCP-7042:

 YES! NO HURT. NEVER HURT. MISTAKE!

Dr. Erende:

 You want us to believe that you would never hurt anyone? That was just the tip of the iceberg.

SCP-7042:

 YES! LOVE ANIMALS. SAVE ANIMALS. CREATE TO SAVE. HUMANS ANIMALS. NEVER HURT. MISTAKE. PLEASE. LET FIX!

Dr. Erende:

 Fix this how, SCP-7042?

SCP-7042:

 MAKE. AS SAY. NO PLAY. JUST MAKE. FIX MISTAKES. TOGETHER. I, US. I SORRY!

Dr. Erende seems to flinch again as the crying returns.

Dr. Erende:

 You can be sorry, but that doesn't change what happened, and we can not trust what you say. You've already proven to be willingly devious.

SCP-7042:

 I. BE BETTER. PLEASE. NOT DONE. CHANCE. GIVE CHANCE!

Dr. Erende:

 You already played that card, and regardless, that is out of my hands.

SCP-7042:

 NO! I GIVE CHANCE! PROVIDENCE.

Dr. Erende:

 You're bargaining.

SCP-7042:

 NO. HONEST. PLEASE. LUCKY DAY. REMEMBER?

Dr. Erende:

 You are not a good luck charm! You aren't some bastion of hope! You're just some trickster with the mentality of a child!

SCP-7042:

 I AM. I AM. I AM. HELP FIX ME. PROMISE. TO LISTEN.

Dr. Erende:

 I…I'm sorry. Why am I sorry?

Dr. Erende shakes his head and backs away from SCP-7042 before exiting the room, the security staff following.

SCP-7042:

 DONT GO. DONT GO! SORRY! PLEASE. I NEED. MORE TO DO. FOR HIM. FOR HER. FOR YOU. FOR YOU! FOR US!

<End Log, 13:26>

Closing Statement:

 Dr. Erende immediately submitted himself for a cognitohazard screening following the conversation. SCP-7042 was found to have latent cognitohazardous abilities. Initial testing was found to have been faulty. During periods of dormancy, the influences recede to a point where it appears the afflicted are still acting in their normal functioning states. Furthermore, the cognitohazard only affects individuals whose careers involve the care, breeding, and conservation of animals of any kind. SCP-7042 will shift their perceptions to consider it an object of providence and form a protective, pseudo-familial bond with the object the longer it remains in their possession. At the moment, it is not known if the SCP is aware of its influence or if it is a latent property of the object. If several individuals are infected, they will seek each other out, grouping together into a cult-like organization whose goal is to learn more about SCP-7042 and how to control her powers in the name of conservation, experimentation, and revitalization. The beginning of said occurrence was found within the staff of Site-84, using the pseudonym Gaia's Forty-Two, under the purview of Dr. Waller. All afflicted staff were administered Class C Amnestics, though Dr. Waller is currently under close administrative observation after speaking to the on-site therapist about a sourceless feeling of loss. Site-84's Director has suspended all testing with SCP-7042. SCP-7042 has been sequestered in the Archives.
