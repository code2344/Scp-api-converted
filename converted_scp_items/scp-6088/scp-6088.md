**Item #:** SCP-6088
**Object Class:** Keter
**Special Containment Procedures:** Foundation agents embedded within the National Aeronautics and Space Administration are to periodically search through all stored records and check for signs of SCP-6088. In the event of a positive identification, the contaminated record is to be temporarily sealed and monitored until the phenomenon abates.
**Description:** SCP-6088 is a phenomenon in which written records pertaining to NASA's Voyager program are spontaneously altered to include reference to a fictitious _Herald_ space probe. These alterations are relatively minor, consisting of at most a single paragraph, but details described are consistent across occurrences. Alterations caused by SCP-6088 are believed to persist only for a short amount of time — the longest observed alteration lasting only six hours.
Alterations caused by SCP-6088 most often consist of brief and macabre references to _Herald_ as a counterpart to _Voyager_ , usually replacing _Voyager 2_ in descriptions. Even in cases where they are not outright replaced, mentions of _Voyager 2_ are often excised during SCP-6088. No records to date have explicitly described the supposed purpose of _Herald_ , and what information is provided does not give any wider context.
Mentions of a 'Black Accusation' — a presumed counterpart to the Golden Record carried by _Voyager 1_ and _2_ — are also included in a number of SCP-6088 alterations.
