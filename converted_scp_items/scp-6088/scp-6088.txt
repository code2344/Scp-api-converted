Item #:

 SCP-6088

Object Class:

 Keter

Special Containment Procedures:

 Foundation agents embedded within the National Aeronautics and Space Administration are to periodically search through all stored records and check for signs of SCP-6088. In the event of a positive identification, the contaminated record is to be temporarily sealed and monitored until the phenomenon abates.

Description:

 SCP-6088 is a phenomenon in which written records pertaining to NASA's Voyager program are spontaneously altered to include reference to a fictitious 

Herald

 space probe. These alterations are relatively minor, consisting of at most a single paragraph, but details described are consistent across occurrences. Alterations caused by SCP-6088 are believed to persist only for a short amount of time — the longest observed alteration lasting only six hours.

Alterations caused by SCP-6088 most often consist of brief and macabre references to 

Herald

 as a counterpart to 

Voyager

, usually replacing 

Voyager 2

 in descriptions. Even in cases where they are not outright replaced, mentions of 

Voyager 2

 are often excised during SCP-6088. No records to date have explicitly described the supposed purpose of 

Herald

, and what information is provided does not give any wider context.

Mentions of a 'Black Accusation' — a presumed counterpart to the Golden Record carried by 

Voyager 1

 and 

2

 — are also included in a number of SCP-6088 alterations.

"I've been reading over the records you want compiled onto the Accusation. The majority I would agree with, but the current Turkish government doesn't recognize what happened in Armenia as a genocide. Diplomatically, can we really include it?"

Original Text:

 

"Thank you for the update. I've looked over the figures myself, but I'd feel reassured if you were to go over them one more time. Better safe than sorry, you understand?"

Writer:

"Voyager and Herald, brothers of the century, set off from Earth in opposite directions — one to sing of humanity's future, the other to warn of its past. Only one yet reached a destination."

Original Text:

 

"Voyager 1 and Voyager 2, brothers of the century, set off from Earth — both of them sailing on a journey that we will never know the end of."

"Recall. Voyager. Herald. Voyager. Herald. Voyager. Herald. If we are ourselves blameless, then by what metric can we be forgiven?"
