SCP-8408

Item №:

 SCP-8408

Object Class:

 Concealed

Special Containment Procedures:

 SCP-8408 is to be covered with a standard-issue cotton bedsheet at all times. The sheet is to be washed once per month. Removing it for any other purpose is strictly prohibited.

Description:

Incident 8408.1

Attempted Containment Breach

[Dr. Melissa Sharrow is washing dishes. The setting sun is visible through the window, casting the room in half-shadow. SCP-8408 enters.]

SCP-8408:

 Can I sit at the table?

Dr. Sharrow:

 You may.

[SCP-8408 sits. It is able to remain still for several minutes, but then begins to fidget. It slowly starts tugging at its sheet.]

Dr. Sharrow:

 SCP-8408.

[Dr. Sharrow shuts off the faucet but does not turn her head.]

Dr. Sharrow:

 Are you trying to take off your sheet again?

SCP-8408:

 

Nuh-uh.

Dr. Sharrow:

 Don't lie to me.

SCP-8408:

 But I'm not!

[Dr. Sharrow's knuckles whiten around the edge of a plate.]

Dr. Sharrow:

 Do you intend to break your promise, 8408?

[Silence.]

Dr. Sharrow:

 Well? Do you?

SCP-8408:

 …No. I'm sorry.

[Dr. Sharrow twists the faucet and resumes dishwashing.]

Dr. Sharrow:

 Don't be sorry. Just be better.

Incident 8408.2

Attempted Containment Breach

[Dr. Sharrow is reading in the living room. SCP-8408 enters.]

SCP-8408:

 'Scuse me, M— Um. Dr. Sharrow.

[Dr. Sharrow's mouth twists with irritation.]

Dr. Sharrow:

 Yes, SCP-8408?

SCP-8408:

 Can I take off my sheet? I don't feel so good.

[Dr. Sharrow sighs.]

Dr. Sharrow:

 I'm not going to have this conversation with you again. No.

SCP-8408:

 But— But I really am sick! My skin feels like it doesn't fit me anymore and two of my 

teeth

 fell out and I think I'm starting to taste 

colors

—

[Dr. Sharrow snaps her book closed and SCP-8408 flinches.]

Dr. Sharrow:

 If you're going to stay here, I don't want to have to look at you. You owe me that much.

SCP-8408:

 I'm— I'm sorry about what happened. I didn't mean to do it. I didn't know.

[Dr. Sharrow stands.]

Dr. Sharrow:

 Get out of my sight.

[SCP-8408 exits.]

Incident 8408.3

[DESIGNATION PENDING]

[SCP-8408 is lying on the floor, still covered by its sheet. Entering, Dr. Sharrow nearly trips over SCP-8408 and stifles a curse.]

Dr. Sharrow:

 What are you doing on the ground, 8408? Get up.

[No response.]

Dr. Sharrow:

 8408.

[No response.]

Dr. Sharrow:

 SCP-8408, listen to me when I'm talking to you.

[No response.]

Dr. Sharrow:

 8408!

[No response.]

Dr. Sharrow:

 …8408?

[No response. Dr. Sharrow nudges SCP-8408 with her foot.]

Dr. Sharrow:

 Thomas?

[No response. Dr. Sharrow gingerly removes the sheet. Only pale feathers and sundered skin remain. All else has fled.]
