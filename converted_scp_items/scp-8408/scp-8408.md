SCP-8408
**Item №:** SCP-8408
**Object Class:** Concealed
**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-8408 is to be covered with a standard-issue cotton bedsheet at all times. The sheet is to be washed once per month. Removing it for any other purpose is strictly prohibited.
**Description:**
### Incident 8408.1
### Attempted Containment Breach
* * *
_[Dr. Melissa Sharrow is washing dishes. The setting sun is visible through the window, casting the room in half-shadow. SCP-8408 enters.]_
**SCP-8408:** Can I sit at the table?
**Dr. Sharrow:** You may.
_[SCP-8408 sits. It is able to remain still for several minutes, but then begins to fidget. It slowly starts tugging at its sheet.]_
**Dr. Sharrow:** SCP-8408.
_[Dr. Sharrow shuts off the faucet but does not turn her head.]_
**Dr. Sharrow:** Are you trying to take off your sheet again?
**SCP-8408:** _Nuh-uh._
**Dr. Sharrow:** Don't lie to me.
**SCP-8408:** But I'm not!
_[Dr. Sharrow's knuckles whiten around the edge of a plate.]_
**Dr. Sharrow:** Do you intend to break your promise, 8408?
_[Silence.]_
**Dr. Sharrow:** Well? Do you?
**SCP-8408:** …No. I'm sorry.
_[Dr. Sharrow twists the faucet and resumes dishwashing.]_
**Dr. Sharrow:** Don't be sorry. Just be better.
### Incident 8408.2
### Attempted Containment Breach
* * *
_[Dr. Sharrow is reading in the living room. SCP-8408 enters.]_
**SCP-8408:** 'Scuse me, M— Um. Dr. Sharrow.
_[Dr. Sharrow's mouth twists with irritation.]_
**Dr. Sharrow:** Yes, SCP-8408?
**SCP-8408:** Can I take off my sheet? I don't feel so good.
_[Dr. Sharrow sighs.]_
**Dr. Sharrow:** I'm not going to have this conversation with you again. No.
**SCP-8408:** But— But I really am sick! My skin feels like it doesn't fit me anymore and two of my _teeth_ fell out and I think I'm starting to taste _colors_ —
_[Dr. Sharrow snaps her book closed and SCP-8408 flinches.]_
**Dr. Sharrow:** If you're going to stay here, I don't want to have to look at you. You owe me that much.
**SCP-8408:** I'm— I'm sorry about what happened. I didn't mean to do it. I didn't know.
_[Dr. Sharrow stands.]_
**Dr. Sharrow:** Get out of my sight.
_[SCP-8408 exits.]_
### Incident 8408.3
### [DESIGNATION PENDING]
* * *
_[SCP-8408 is lying on the floor, still covered by its sheet. Entering, Dr. Sharrow nearly trips over SCP-8408 and stifles a curse.]_
**Dr. Sharrow:** What are you doing on the ground, 8408? Get up.
_[No response.]_
**Dr. Sharrow:** 8408.
_[No response.]_
**Dr. Sharrow:** SCP-8408, listen to me when I'm talking to you.
_[No response.]_
**Dr. Sharrow:** 8408!
_[No response.]_
**Dr. Sharrow:** …8408?
_[No response. Dr. Sharrow nudges SCP-8408 with her foot.]_
**Dr. Sharrow:** Thomas?
_[No response. Dr. Sharrow gingerly removes the sheet. Only pale feathers and sundered skin remain. All else has fled.]_
