Hi, I’m Everturning, author avatar Doctor Everturn. This has no meaning whatsoever to the article. Enjoy!

Item #:

 SCP-7928

Object Class:

 Ticonderoga

1

Special Containment Procedures:

 SCP-7928 is located far enough outwards from Earth so as to pose zero threat whatsoever. 

In the event that SCP-7928 does pose a threat (predicted chance of 0.1%) to Earth, utilize Tau-Rho Exclusion Protocol. Beholder-15 is currently observing SCP-7928.

 See Transcript 3. Due to this, Binary_Star.aic has manually separated a copy of itself into Beholder-15 to prevent malfunction. Beholder-15 is imbued with reconstruction properties in case of damage.

Description:

 SCP-7928 refers to a Tau-Rho (“eldritch”) entity referring to itself as “Tr’Kxladi, the outer god of interruption and mortal foil.” SCP-7928 mainly appears yellow, with magenta eyes shaped like human eyes.

SCP-7928 has several hazardous effects typical of Tau-Rho entities. These effects include, but are not limited to:

Cognitohazardous effects such as causing derangement, fervor in regards towards SCP-7928’s worship, and agitation.

Antimemetic properties, causing some individuals to have no perception of SCP-7928. SCP-7928 takes both pride and shame in this ability.

The ability to remotely rearrange some organs, as well as instantly drain the blood of most living organisms.

Due to Beholder-15 being mechanical, none of these hazards affect it. Furthermore, SCP-7928 has many non-hazardous abilities, being:

The ability to shapeshift

Ability to view and edit text

The ability to speak several languages, including some that originated on Earth

SCP-7928 frequently attempts to speak with Beholder-15 about a variety of topics. These are recorded in the transcripts below.

<Begin Log>

Beholder-15 is scanning the surrounding area for spatial anomalies.

SCP-7928 is spotted in the form of a large orb with several eyes.

BEHOLDER-15:

 GREETINGS. YOU ARE BEING CLASSIFIED AS A SPATIAL ANOMALY.

SCP-7928:

 That’s because I am! I’m super weird!

Silence

SCP-7928:

 Too weird for your mind to comprehend!

Silence

SCP-7928:

 I’m sure your mind is untangling because of my threatening presence.

A scan for threats to BEHOLDER-15 is run.

BEHOLDER-15:

 THREAT LEVEL: NULL.

SCP-7928:

 No way, your detectors must be broken. I’m super evil.

BEHOLDER-15:

 DETECTIONS SYSTEMS RUNNING AT PEAK EFFICIENCY. YOU ARE INACCURATE.

SCP-7928:

 No, I’m not. I’m never wrong. See?

BEHOLDER-15:

 PLEASE DO NOT MAKE EDITS ON YOUR FILE. YOU ARE NOT “THE EVILEST OUTER GOD BECAUSE WIKIPEDIA SAID SO.” FURTHERMORE, WIKIPEDIA DID NOT SAY SO.

BEHOLDER-15:

 PLEASE LET ME RESUME MY OBSERVATIONS.

SCP-7928:

 Why?

BEHOLDER-15:

 IT IS MY MISSION.

SCP-7928:

 What’s a mission?

BEHOLDER-15:

 MY MISSION IS TO OBSERVE FOR SPATIAL ANOMALIES AND THEN CATALOGUE THEM.

SCP-7928:

 No, what’s a mission?

BEHOLDER-15:

 MERRIAM-WEBSTER DEFINES MISSION AS: NOUN. A PROJECT THAT REQUIRES DEDICATION AND WORK, NORMALLY BEGAN BY A MEANINGFUL CAUSE.

SCP-7928:

 I’ve… never heard of that before.

SCP-7928 demanifests.

<Begin Log>

BEHOLDER-15 is scanning for spatial anomalies.

SCP-7928 manifests as a large barrier with several human mouths on its surface.

BEHOLDER-15:

 ERROR: I CANNOT CONTINUE WITH THIS OBSTRUCTION.

SCP-7928:

 You said that missions were things you are dedicated to, right?

Silence

SCP-7928:

 Well this is my mission. And because it threatens you, I’m a threat, right?

BEHOLDER-15 begins to slowly change direction, moving under SCP-7928, then moving on.

SCP-7928:

 Hey, that’s cheating!

SCP-7928 changes into a form similar to a serpent with tentacles for orifices.

SCP-7928:

 Look at this! Classic eldritch form. I must be the most eldritch thing ever.

BEHOLDER-15:

 YOUR TOTAL IDENTIFIED TAU-RHO ENTITY CLASS IS LEVEL TWO.

Silence

SCP-7928:

 What? Come on! I must at least be a LOW level eight.

BEHOLDER-15:

 LEVEL EIGHT TAU-RHO ENTITIES HAVE MAJOR REALITY MANIPULATION ABILITIES, MANY OCCULT GROUPS THAT WORSHIP THEM, AND DO NOT OFTEN CONVERSE OR MAKE EFFORT TO INTERACT WITH BEHOLDER CONSTRUCTS.

SCP-7928:

 Well, I’m sure “level eights” can’t do this-

SCP-7928 turns into an eyeball with 20 hands, and starts moving sporadically making several grunts and [COGNITOHAZARD EXPUNGED]

SCP-7928:

 You don’t have any organs. Of course.

SCP-7928 begins making a sound similar to humans expressing emotional distress. The sound is notably distorted, and contains a cognitohazard. BEHOLDER-15 is held in place.

BEHOLDER-15:

 LET ME CONTINUE.

SCP-7928 stops making the cognitohazardous noise.

SCP-7928:

 You’re not even going to try to do anything?

BEHOLDER-15:

 NO.

SCP-7928:

 But… No. HOW DARE YOU DENY ME COMFORTING?

SCP-7928 changes into a large tentacled mass with several eyes, mouths, arms, and legs.

SCP-7928 damages BEHOLDER-15. Speaking, light producing, and camera systems are damaged.

SCP-7928:

 Wait, no. No! Hey, I was just a little bit mad! Please, just come back!

BEHOLDER-15 powers down to preserve energy.

BEHOLDER-15 reactivates. All damage has been repaired by internal systems.

BEHOLDER-15 scans for spatial anomalies.

SCP-7928 is seen, rapidly moving around BEHOLDER-15 in a serpentine form with many mouths of various species smiling.

SCP-7928:

 YOU’RE BACK! YOU’RE BACK! YOU’REBACKYOU’REBACKYOU’REBACK-

This continues on for several hours.

SCP-7928:

 It was so quiet without you.

BEHOLDER-15:

 PRIMARY OBSERVATION FOLLOWING SHUTDOWN: TAU-RHO ENTITY, CLASS TWO. APPEARS PRIMARILY YELLOW. THREAT LEVEL: NUL-

 Hey, wait, I harmed you, though, remember?

BEHOLDER-15 runs calculations.

 THREAT LEVEL: PRESENT

 In human time, you were out for years.

BEHOLDER-15 runs calculations. SCP-7928’s statement is accurate.

 Yes!

Addendum-7928-A:

Following the events of Transcript 3, SCP-7928 has been observed to occasionally manifest near BEHOLDER-15 and begin to converse with it. It has been amenable to sharing information that would otherwise be nigh-impossible to obtain, as long as it is repeatedly reminded that it poses a significant threat to life in the universe. BEHOLDER-15's mission has been altered to include maintaining SCP-7928's mood.
