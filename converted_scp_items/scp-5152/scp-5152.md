**Item #:** SCP-5152
**Object Class:** Safe
**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-5152 is to be stored in a Class 1 Anomalous Object container at Site-29 when not undergoing testing or use by Foundation personnel. Access to the object must be approved by at least two researchers of Level 2 clearance or higher. Testing of SCP-5152 must be monitored by Site-29 medical staff in the event of psychological and behavioral abnormalities in subjects post-exposure to SCP-5152. Under no circumstances are personnel that has been administered amnestetics to be allowed access to SCP-5152 (See Addendum 5152-A).
**Description:** SCP-5152 is a black eye mask composed of silk, polyester, and rubber. The object exhibits no unusual physical properties apart from its tensile strength, which resembles that of hardened steel. The mask itself is consistent with the Manta brand of sleep masks produced between the years of 2005 and 2012. However, the mask itself lacks the company’s manufacturer markings.
When worn, the wearer is transported to a corridor stretching beyond the subject's range of vision, with doors lining its walls. Various tests indicate that the number of doorways and the physical length of the corridor change depending on the subject, with the only consistency being that of the corridor’s apparent stonework. The corridor appears to be constructed of a marble-like substance, with each of the doors constructed of similar material. However, attempted testing of the material in question has resulted in failure, as samples appear to be unstable outside of the anomaly[1](javascript:;). All GPS tracking of subjects entering SCP-5152 has proven ineffective, implying that the corridor may exist in a separate reality.
Subjects report tranquility and increased curiosity inside the corridor, pushing them to navigate it. After three minutes, the subject will attempt to open one of the doors and proceed within. Subjects report observing a third-person perspective scene of an event from their past within, with a majority of these scenes prompting a positive response from subjects[2](javascript:;).
Subjects have also observed vocalizations (hereby designated SCP-5152-1) post conclusion of the observed scene. In all cases, SCP-5152-1 will attempt conversation with the subject in regards to the scene. In all cases, SCP-5152-1 prompts an overall positive outlook from the subject and is often described as a voice similar to that of a close friend or family member related to the subject. Most commonly, SCP-5152-1 will take on the voice and mannerisms of an individual involved within the specific memory of the subject[3](javascript:;).
When SCP-5152 is removed, subjects return to their location prior to interaction with SCP-5152 with no observable deterioration in physical or mental health regardless of time elapsed. It is of note that individuals suffering from PTSD[4](javascript:;) or other stress-related conditions observe the most significant change in overall demeanor post-exposure to SCP-5152. Testing into the potential use as an antidepressant or therapeutic device is ongoing.
**Discovery:** SCP-5152 was discovered by Foundation field agents on 5/7/20██ following numerous reports of a new anomalous mental health treatment program developed by DreamScape Pharmaceuticals™, based in Tampa, Florida[5](javascript:;). Foundation agents confirmed the anomalous nature of SCP-5152 after field agents arranged appointments with the clinic in question, and a demonstration of the procedure was observed. Class-B amnestetics were supplied to all staff at the clinic and all documented individuals that underwent treatment via SCP-5152 were subsequently questioned, amnesticized, and released. SCP-5152 was later transported to its current containment at site-29.
**Addendum 5152-A:** Due to the substantial breach of confidential information spanning various clearance levels due to SCP-5152, any further testing of SCP-5152 utilizing individuals that have undergone amnestetic treatment is unanimously prohibited by the O5 Council (See Experiment III for details).

[\- Experiment I](javascript:;)
**Experiment I**
_D-9341 is a 30-year old caucasian male previously known as Sgt. Benjamin O. Walker. D-9341 has a history of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder-related nightmares following the failed Operation Hellfire, resulting in D-9341’s AWOL status and eventual dishonorable discharge from the United States Marine Corps. Subject is equipped with a digital camcorder outfitted with a transmission beacon, a GPS tracker, vital monitoring systems, and an audio headset for communication with Dr. Trout at command._
**< BEGIN LOG>**
_Subject D-9341 is escorted into testing chamber 12-A and instructed to place SCP-5152 over his eyes. Subject complies and places the object over his eyes. Video and audio feed malfunctions for approximately thirty seconds before the connection is reestablished. GPS tracking of D-9341 malfunctions, and subsequent attempts to re-establish GPS location fail. D-9341 is observed standing in an apparent marble corridor stretching beyond the scope of the video observation equipment with doorways of similar material on either side._
**Dr. Trout:** Visual confirmed. D-9341, please report.
**D-9341:** Yeah, I’m here… wherever here is…
**Dr. Trout:** Please proceed down the corridor.
_D-9341 is observed to turn, facing down both directions of the corridor. After two minutes, D-9341 proceeds down the corridor in a single direction, stopping intermittently while examining the doorways._
**D-9341:** Something feels off, doc.
**Dr. Trout:** Please elaborate.
**D-9341:** I don’t know… it feels like I’m dreaming or some shit… what exactly is this place?
_Dr. Trout examines the vital signs of D-9341, observing brain activity consistent with REM sleep cycles. The rustling of papers is heard for approximately five seconds before the conversation resumes._
**Dr. Trout:** Please continue down the corridor.
_D-9341 proceeds down the corridor for an additional fifty-five seconds with no observable endpoint to the corridor before pausing in front of a door to his left. Subject is observed reaching for the doorknob before dialog resumes._
**Dr. Trout:** D-9341, why have you stopped?
**D-9341:** I… I don’t know. Curiosity I guess… why are there so many doors?
_No response from Dr. Trout is heard for around thirty seconds, at which point Dr. Trout instructs D-9341 to open the door in front of him and proceed through it. D-9341 obliges and enters the doorway, appearing in what seems to be a village in modern day Afghanistan. D-9341 is observed quickening his breathing upon observation of the scene._
**D-9341:** What the fuck… what the FUCK?!
_D-9341 is seen frantically looking around the scene before pausing on three individuals dressed in standard United States Marine field operations equipment, with one of the soldiers matching D-9341’s physical appearance. D-9341 approaches one of the individuals, reaching a hand out to them as the group proceeds down a narrow street._
**Dr. Trout:** D-9341, please report.
_No response from D-9341 is given for the next few minutes as contact attempts go unacknowledged. D-9341 proceeds to follow the individuals within the scene._
**D-9341:** No! Stop! James for fucks sake please stop!
**Dr. Trout:** D-9341, are you there? Please respond.
_The individuals proceed forward despite D-9341’s requests. After a few seconds, the sound of a firearm discharge is observed in the audio feed and one of the figures collapses to the ground. D-9341 is observed in extreme emotional distress following this event and the scene ends. D-9341 is observed sobbing for approximately two minutes following the conclusion of the scene. Dr. Trout attempts dialogue with D-9341 during this time. Subject does not respond, and vocalizations from an entity (designated SCP-5152-1) are observed._
**SCP-5152-1:** It wasn’t your fault, Ben.
_D-9341 is observed turning to his right, then left before standing still once again, as if confused._
**D-9341:** Who said that?!
**SCP-5152-1:** Easy, I’m not gonna hurt you. I’m sorry you had to see that again.
_D-9341 is silent for a few seconds._
**D-9341:** You were my brother…
**SCP-5152-1:** I still am, but I never blamed you for what happened that day.
**D-9341:** Our position was compromised… we should have been more careful… maybe then you wouldn’t have had to die…
**SCP-5152-1:** Ben, please… this isn’t the life I wanted for you… hell, this isn’t even living. You’re dwelling on the past when you should be looking towards the future. You can’t keep thinking about what you could’ve done. It’ll eat you up from the inside out.
**D-9341:** I tried to save you…
**SCP-5152-1:** And I would have done the same for you, but it's time to live your best life. If not for yourself, then for me.
_D-9341 is observed sobbing once again before SCP-5152-1 establishes dialogue once again._
**SCP-5152-1:** It’s okay, Ben. I forgive you… it’s about time you forgive yourself.
**D-9341:** I love you, James… I miss you so much…
**SCP-5152-1:** I never left, Ben… and I never will.
_D-9341 is observed standing at attention, saluting in the direction in which audio observed SCP-5152-1 originating from, before lowering his hand and exiting the scene through the same door as its entry. Video surveillance fails to observe any physical manifestation of SCP-5152-1. D-9341 is instructed to remove SCP-5152 and is subsequently escorted back to his cell following psychiatric evaluation by site psychologists._
**< END LOG>**
**Notes:** Upon questioning, D-9341 stated that SCP-5152-1 was the voice of one Pvt. Jameson B. Walker, who was fatally wounded while on assignment with D-9341 prior to Operation Hellfire. When pressed, D-9341 simply said, “I think I finally got to say goodbye”. Subject reports no further nightmares post SCP-5152 exposure and has shown an increase in cooperation with Foundation personnel following exposure. Further testing to determine the effects of multiple exposures to SCP-5152 has been approved by lead researcher Dr. Manning.
[\+ Experiment II](javascript:;)
[\- Experiment II](javascript:;)
**Experiment II**
_D-9341 is brought into testing chamber 26-B for experimentation with SCP-5152 following approval of additional testing by Dr. Manning. Subject is equipped with a digital camcorder outfitted with a transmission beacon, vital monitoring systems, a geological sampling kit, and an audio headset for communication with Dr. Trout at command._
**< BEGIN LOG>**
_D-9341 is instructed by security personnel to place SCP-5152 over his eyes. Subject complies without hesitation and places SCP-5152 over his eyes. Video and audio feed cuts for approximately ten seconds before the connection is reestablished, and transportation to the corridor is confirmed by command._
**Dr. Trout:** Connection is proficient, systems operational. D-9341, please report.
**D-9341:** Yep, I’m in the hall again. Need me to walk down it again?
**Dr. Trout:** In a moment. Please use the provided sample kit to collect stone from the walls and doorways on either side.
**D-9341:** Um… alright doc.
_D-9341 is observed approaching the wall to his left and attempting to collect geological samples for analysis. Approximately twenty seconds pass before D-9341 acquires a sample of the corridor wall. The subject then gathers a sample from a door to his left, taking ten seconds to complete the task. Visual inspection via video feed shows little variance between the materials._
**D-9341:** Is this enough for the eggheads in the lab?
**Dr. Trout:** Yes, the sample size is sufficient. Please proceed down the corridor on your right.
_D-9341 turns down the corridor to their right and proceeds as instructed. After approximately one minute of walking down the corridor, video feeds observe what seems to be the end of the corridor constructed of the same material as the corridors other features._
**D-9341:** Hey doc, what am I doing now?
**Dr. Trout:** Please collect a sample of the material in front of you, then proceed through the first doorway to your right behind you.
_D-9341 sighs then begins to extract a sample of the hall material at the end of the corridor. After approximately ten seconds, D-9341 turns around and proceeds to the first door on his right, opening the doorway and proceeding through it. The subject appears in a large room with ten individuals dressed in military fatigues and equipped with standard-issue United States Marine arms and armaments. The building itself appears to be constructed of concrete, with several small windows on the far edge of the room; the outside scenery best resembles the capital city of Kabul, Afghanistan. D-9341 shows signs of unease as he proceeds to explore the scene._
**D-9341:** Doc… I don’t like this.
**Dr. Trout:** I beg your pardon?
**D-9341:** I’m saying I don’t want to fucking be here. Let me out.
**Dr. Trout:** I’m afraid I cannot allow that.
**D-9341:** The fuck you mean you can’t?! I can take this mask off whenever I damn well please!
**Dr. Trout:** D-9341, ending the experiment will result in your termination. Do you understand?
_D-9341 groans loudly, putting a hand to his forehead._
**D-9341:** FUCK!! You win. Fucking asshole…
_D-9341 is observed turning frantically to either side of the room, examining the scene. Vital monitoring equipment shows an accelerated heart rate and adrenal spike consistent with the acute stress response. D-9341 is observed attempting to exit the scene while the figures converse with one another. However, said dialogue remained unintelligible due to the D-9341’s frantic movements._
**Dr. Trout:** D-9341, remain in the scene and stay calm.
**D-9341:** Fuck you! Let me out of here!
_D-9341 is observed turning back to the scene as the figures rush to the far right window following what appears to be a detonation of improvised explosives. The remaining figures appear to take a defensive position in relation to the windows, with one figure appearing to command them. Facial recognition determines the commanding figure to be D-9341._
**D-9341:** Fuck! Doc, please! Let me out of here!
_D-9341 sprints to one of the windows, and video surveillance observes several figures in varying clothing on the streets below. Suddenly a large explosion is heard and the scene turns a pale orange color. Video equipment malfunctions for approximately three seconds before resuming. D-9341 appears to be lying prone on the ground with the camera facing the ceiling. Audio equipment documents the sound of exasperated breathing, presumably from D-9341._
**Dr. Trout:** D-9341, report. Please respond.
_D-9341 does not respond but proceeds to stand and observe his surroundings. Several of the figures lay on the ground motionless, while the figure resembling subject D-9341 lays against a wall with various lacerations to the torso and thighs. The figure seems to look around for ten seconds, before appearing to fall unconscious. D-9341’s heart rate accelerates to two hundred ten beats per minute. Medical staff instructs Dr. Trout to terminate the experiment when vocalizations are observed._
**SCP-5152-1:** Hey, Ben… I’m sorry you had to live through that again.
**D-9341:** _sobbing_ why…
**SCP-5152-1:** I’m sorry… but there was nothing you could’ve done. It was an ambush. Fuckers found our location before we could react.
**D-9341:** You weren’t even supposed to be there… we were pinned down and needed reinforcements. Then it all went to shit.
**SCP-5152-1:** You saved us though… had it not been for you far more would’ve lost their lives that day. Think of Pvt. Maxwell. Can you truly say that you didn’t save his life?
**D-9341:** I didn’t… I ruined it. He’s fucking paralyzed…
**SCP-5152-1:** But he is alive… You saved his life. You let him see his daughter again… his wife again.
_D-9341 is observed weeping as he adjusts his position to his knees._
**D-9341:** But what about you? What about your friends, your family? What about them?
**SCP-5152-1:** They don’t blame you for what happened. I Lost my sight… but it's because of you that I’m able to hold them in my arms again. You may not realize it, but you saved more than just our lives that day.
**D-9341:** So much death… and for what? So we could take some damned city?
**SCP-5152-1:** Ben, all of that is in the past. It’s time for you to let go of your hatred for yourself. Become the man I know you were meant to be.
_D-9341 stands._
**SCP-5152-1:** Do you get it now?
**D-9341:** I never caused your pain…
**SCP-5152-1:** There you go… now do me a favor, will ya?
**D-9341:** Anything…
**SCP-5152-1:** Keep doing what you do best; keep us safe.
**D-9341:** I will… I promise.
_D-9341 turns away from the scene and removes SCP-5152. Security personnel apprehend D-9341 and escort him to the infirmary for psychiatric evaluation. It is of note that the samples of the internal surfaces of SCP-5152 and its corridor seemed to demanifest once D-9341 exited SCP-5152._
**< END LOG>**
**Notes:** When debriefed, D-9341 revealed that he was involved in an ambush during Operation Hellfire which led to the casualties of three men within his unit, with the remaining individuals suffering major injuries. When pressed, D-9341 simply stated, “I got a promise to keep, doc. A promise to an old friend”. D-9341 developed an increase in morale and has repeatedly requested to “fulfill his promise”. Additional experimentation with other D-Class personnel to improve overall cooperation has been approved by assistant researcher Dr. Warren. Further attempts to gather samples of SCP-5152 and its corridor are being considered for further experiments.

**Experiment III**
_Following approval from Dr. Warren and additional suggestions by Dr. Trout, D-9341 was once again selected for experimentation to determine the overall effectiveness of SCP-5152 as a means of improving morale within the D-Class population. Once more, D-9341 is equipped with a digital camcorder outfitted with a transmission beacon, vital monitoring systems, and an audio headset for communication with Dr. Trout at command._
**< BEGIN LOG>**
_D-9341 is escorted to testing chamber 46-C by security personnel. Upon entering, D-9341 shows mild enthusiasm upon seeing SCP-5152. D-9341 proceeds to cover his eyes with SCP-5152 despite the absence of instruction to do so. Video and audio equipment remains constant with no transition, implying the transportation into SCP-5152 was instantaneous._
**D-9341:** Alright, doc. I’m back in. What do you need me to do again?
**Dr. Trout:** You may proceed down either direction of the corridor. Enter a door of your choosing and remain within until the vocalizations are once again observed.
**D-9341:** Vocalizations? You mean my friends and shit?
**Dr. Trout:** Irrelevant. Please proceed.
**D-9341:** What do you mean irrelevant?
**Dr. Trout:** Proceed down the corridor, D-9341.
_D-9341 is observed sighing, then turns down both directions of the corridor before continuing down the pathway to his left for approximately one minute. Video feed observes the estimated sample collection locations.._
**Dr: Trout:** Hold on. D-9341, please turn to your left.
**D-9341:** Huh? Um… alright.
_D-9341 complies and turns to his left, appearing to match the location of the first sample collection in experiment II. Notably, the corridor exhibits no sign of damage that would be present from said sample collection. Dr. Trout is observed taking a note of the occurrence before resuming dialogue._
**Dr. Trout:** Strange… this was where he took sample A, correct?
**D-9341:** Sample A? You mean when you had me scrape some stone off the wall?
_D-9341 examines the wall with his right hand and seems to pause momentarily._
**D-9341:** Yeah… this seems like the place. But there’s not even a dent.
**Dr. Trout:** Yes, I have come to the same conclusion. Please proceed onward in the direction you had previously.
_D-9341 complies and continues down the corridor once again. After approximately one minute, D-9341 stops and turns to a doorway on his right._
**D-9341:** I can go in, right doc?
**Dr. Trout:** Correct. Please enter the doorway.
_D-9341 complies, entering the doorway and proceeding through. Upon entry, D-9341 appears in what appears to be a standard D-Class holding cell. Subject begins to look around as if confused._
**D-9341:** I’m back in my cell… ?
_D-9341 turns around to observe a figure dressed in a Class-D jumpsuit laying on a cot (presumably D-9341). After ten seconds two figures dressed in Site-29 security are observed standing in the hallway. One of which begins dialogue with the D-Class figure._
_”Hey, we’ve got some work for you. Do me a favor and step out of your cell.”_
**D-9341:** What… ?
_The D-Class figure stands and approaches SCP-5152-F1._
_”Follow me.”_
_The D-Class figure is escorted through the hallway of D-Class Cell Block 37-B and through several doorways until entering what is assumed to be the Heavy Containment Zone of Site-29. The figure is instructed by SCP-5152-F1 to enter testing chamber 1-A of the Heavy Containment Zone._
**D-9341:** Uh… doc? What is this?
**Dr. Trout:** Continue observation.
_D-9341 observes the scene as instructed, following the D-Class figure into the testing chamber. Upon entry, video equipment captures what appears to be a singular syringe of[SCP-008](/scp-008) along with a single instance of [SCP-500](/scp-500). A figure enters the testing chamber equipped with Class V CBRN[6](javascript:;) safety equipment. Command immediately instructs Dr. Trout to terminate testing._
**Dr. Trout:** D-9341, remove SCP-5152 immediately and prepare for debriefing.
_D-9341 does not respond as the new figure injects the D-Class figure with[SCP-008](/scp-008). The D-Class figure appears to wince as the needle punctures its skin, and D-9341 steps back._
**D-9341:** What the hell…?
**Dr. Trout:** D-9341, remove SCP-5152 immediately or you will be terminated upon exit of SCP-5152.
_The figure appears to rapidly progress through the symptoms of[SCP-008](/scp-008) at an abnormal pace, reaching coma onset approximately ten minutes after injection._
**D-9341:** What the fuck? What is he doing to me? WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU DO TO ME?
**Dr. Trout:** Subject is unresponsive to commands. D-9341 is authorized for termination.
[DATA EXPUNGED]
_Subject D-9341 returns to testing chamber 46-C and is immediately terminated by security staff. All personnel involved in the experiment were selectively amnestisized following debriefing and psychiatric evaluation. Involved research staff were reassigned, and new researchers implemented. Proposition to update SCP-5152’s containment class to euclid is currently pending approval._
**< END LOG>**
**Notes:** By unanimous vote of the O5 council, under no circumstances are any personnel that have undergone amnestic treatment to be allowed direct contact with SCP-5152.
