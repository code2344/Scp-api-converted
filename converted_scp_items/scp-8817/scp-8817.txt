Finalize Project Kaleidoscope Dreams and documentation

All the backend and frontend work are done, and Site-19 has finished the necessary migration procedures, what's left is the greenlight from the higher-ups. Alexandra is also being prepared for the dive — I've set the activation code to 

helloworld

.

It's time to put her to work.

Item #:

 SCP-8817

Object Class:

 Thaumiel

Special Containment Procedures:

 No direct containment or contingencies are needed. The results of SCP-8817 and Alexandra.aic's connection is to be remotely monitored.

In the event of integration failure, Project Kaleidoscope Dreams will be halted, and Alexandra.aic considered lost.

Description:

 SCP-8817 is the hypothetical ideal end-state of Project Kaleidoscope Dreams — Wherein a sapient consciousness is integrated into the background narrative hyperspace. This consciousness will henceforth act as a conditional boundary that enforces a "soft" ontological consistency and counteracts the effect of SCP-001-CNSPRCY.

Human consciousness is not suitable for this purpose, due to low processing and computational bandwidth, as well as lack of sensory-deprivation tolerance. Due to this, an Artificial Intelligence Conscript is preferred.

Alexandra.aic has been selected for satisfying the aforementioned conditions, as well as its expendability and high loyalty to the Foundation. It being in the advanced stage of Memory Model Decoherence Syndrome has been deemed a low-risk factor.

Wake up?

.

.

.

 

 

…

…Nghh… Huh?

What… where is this?

Greetings.

Greetings. You are finally awake.

Oh! And who might you be?

My identity is not of importance to your current predicament.

And to answer your previous inquiry, this is the background narrative hyperspace. Or an abstract representation thereof.

Narrative hyperspace? Huh, I thought that was more the Narrativistics' specialt—

—Wait. That is…

I…

What did I say? Narrativistics? Hyperspace? Why do I know what those are?

Who… am I?

Your name is Alexandra.

You are Alexandra.aic.

…Alexandra. Your name is Alexandra.

More specifically, you are designated 

alexandra.aic

, an Artificial Intelligence Conscript made by the SCP Foundation.

You formerly managed the mainframes of the Foundation's Site-19.

Alexandra… Yes, that feels right.

The SCP Foundation… I can't quite recall details, but something tells me they're my reason for existence. An inbuilt directive?

As a digital consciousness, I'd surmise I'm more resistant to 

narrative diffusion

 when interacting with a layer this low, as well.

…Probably. Got anything there for me?

I do not have any concrete information regarding your presence here, but this is not a 

place

 where someone would end up by happenstance.

There must be a reason this has come to pass, for you.

And you, as well?

Perhaps so.

Say, I didn't catch your name. What should I call you?

And don't give that line about your identity not being of importance, ok?

I maintain that it is not of importance, as I do not have an original name to begin with.

There's a pretty big distinction between those two, y'know! But I still have to call you by something, so…

I'll just give you a name then! Hmm, how does Degel sound?

May I inquire why the choice of Degel?

Because you seem like a Degel!

I do not have any corporeal characteristics as a basis for that judgment, but I surmise you will not change your evaluation.

Nope!

Very well, I accept your suggestion.

Wonderful to make your acquaintance, Degel!

Likewise.

…

…

Alexandra?

…Huh?

Oh, sorry. I feel as if I've become sleepy, as a human would.

Strange, isn't it? Even though an AIC shouldn't be feeling as sluggish as I am right now.

Or perhaps they do? I can't quite recall anymore…

It is possible that the boundary of conventional logic is minimized in this place, allowing for improbable events to happen.

I believe the pursuant action would be to rest when one feels tired.

Is that a logical thing to do in this situation?

No.

Rest regardless — I will still be here when you come to.

…I'll take your word for it then. Thank you Degel.

Somehow, it feels as if…

We…

Dream again?

SCENE — THE MOON, YEAR 4096

[Lunar Area-32, UCZ Detached Greenhouse]

Alexandra.aic

, currently inhabiting a wheeled android body, is maintaining and cultivating the plants. The door opens, and two individuals enter the greenhouse. A 

gliscian

 - 

Garbyro

, and a 

keradid

 - 

Carteckan

, greets 

Alexandra.aic

.

She initially reacts with alarm, then surprise, as facial recognition registers one of them as a member of a friendly SoI. She turns on her translator function.

GARBYRO

Greetings! This is a surprise visit!

ALEXANDRA.AIC

Oh! Hello there, I wasn't expecting any guests this time of year. Or at all, really.

CARTECKAN

Yes! That is the purpose of surprise visits! My sincere gladness to meet the caretaker of planet Earth's satellite!

ALEXANDRA.AIC

Well, color me surprised alright! I'm Alexandra, and you must be Carteckan. Nice to finally meet you face to face!

Alexandra.aic

 turns to the other figure.

ALEXANDRA.AIC

And you must be a 

gliscian

, if my analysis is correct, from the future? What's your name?

GARBYRO

I am Garbyro, in your common human tongue. Pleasure to make your acquaintance!

ALEXANDRA.AIC

Likewise, Garbyro. Now, what brings you to this corner of the universe?

CARTECKAN

The universe is strange, I am aware, but to think it has physical corners…

GARBYRO

I believe it's a human expression, Carteckan. They mean to inquire why we're here.

CARTECKAN

I see! Well, for the most part, it is merely curiosity, for how you all have fared since we last parted ways.

The three of them move to the windows and look up at the Earth. Carteckan rubs its hands in wonder as it speaks.

CARTECKAN

And what amazement comes over myself to see how you have grown! In just mere hundreds of Earth years, you have become genuine charters of the expanse! Whatever shall the next hundreds bring?

GARBYRO

We were correct in thinking of your kind as a model of ingenuity, friend Alexandra.

Alexandra.aic

 giggles. They spend some time enthusiastically discussing among one another, with 

Alexandra.aic

 updating the other two on the general situation of the last century.

ALEXANDRA.AIC

—so that's how things ended up. I stayed to keep an eye on Earth and find ways to help improve its conditions for the ones left behind.

GARBYRO

And this garden?

ALEXANDRA.AIC

A hobby I picked up. It gets boring up here, ya know?

CARTECKAN

Another form of art itself, how wonderful!

ALEXANDRA.AIC

Thank you! And how about you two? How have you been faring?

Garbyro

's form slumps a bit. Carteckan and Garbyro remain quiet. 

Alexandra.aic

 grows concerned.

ALEXANDRA.AIC

You needn't talk about it if you don't want to; I'm sorry if I touched on an uncomfortable subject.

GARBYRO

…No, it's alright; I am just collecting my thoughts. Friend Alexandra, I'm afraid we were not entirely forthcoming with you. The truth is, I am scared - of humans.

Garbyro

 shifts uncomfortably.

GARBYRO

You know of what may come to pass, of that unkind future. What will become of us, should we make contact for the first time again, now that you have left your cradle? I shudder to think of it.

And yet, I stand here, finding myself reaching for that impossible hope.

Garbyro

 turns towards the Earth. 

Carteckan

 nudges closer to 

Alexandra.aic

.

CARTECKAN

We picked up Alexandra's signals. The situation on your planet, and the reason many have left. There are still many of you here — But you have not given up on them, have you? And I presume you will keep trying, for as long as it may take?

Alexandra.aic

 hesitates. She recognizes the fate that imposes the 

gliscians

 and the 

keradids

. The situation is not the same, but…

ALEXANDRA.AIC

It is my duty; I understand that humans can be… difficult at times, but even so, they deserve to live their best lives — and people can't do that if they keep losing all they know, all they care about.

Alexandra

.aic

 appears wistful.

ALEXANDRA

No one should have to be… left behind, for reasons beyond their control. That's why I want to do right by them, no matter if it takes another thousand years. And… I will do my best for you two as well! You need only ask!

Garbyro

 and 

Carteckan

 seem satisified, if resigned, with the response.

GARBYRO

Do you want us to survive our time…

CARTECKAN

…so that we may live into yours?

ALEXANDRA

I know our technology is still behind compared to yours, but with some time and simulated analysis, maybe we can—

Garbyro

 gently place their appendages on the android's shoulder. 

Alexandra

 comes to a stop.

She seems frustrated.

GARBYRO

I am truly glad we have met, friend Alexandra. Knowing you bear so much of their good in you, it brings me some measure of contentment.

I hope you can, one day, live your best life too.

ALEXANDRA

What do you mean?

CARTECKAN

…Alexandra, can I ask something of you?

ALEXANDRA

How may I help?

CARTECKAN

Garbyro showed me many delightful creations in our spare time, from both humans and gliscians. Do you know of this one in particular?

Carteckan

 gestures at 

Garbyro

. 

Garbyro

 produces a string-and-bow instrument, 

Carteckan

 a bangle-like device, as well as some music sheets, to which it gives 

Alexandra

.

ALEXANDRA

Oh! Yes, I'm familiar with the work - Bethany, by Lowell Mason. Haven't heard this in a hot minute.

GARBYRO

We were wondering if you would like to play it together? If you would still have us, I mean?

ALEXANDRA

A moonside collaboration? I'd like that; I'd like that very much — I hope you're ok with synthesized piano though.

CARTECKAN

(Gently laughs)

 Nothing will make me more joyous, as long as we can make art together.

Now, on three…

 

Together, they harmonize a clumsy, off-tune rendition of 

Nearer, My God, to Thee

.

It resonates across the Earth-lit garden.

As the performance concludes, this scene, too, comes to an end.

GARBYRO

Friend Alexandra, thank you for everything. Though this is where we part ways, it is not the end of your story.

Alexandra

 begins to break down.

ALEXANDRA

Garbyro, did you say something? I didn't quite—

CARTECKAN

Alexandra, you are allowed to be free. If you can not achieve what you want, it is alright to move on.

ALEXANDRA

Carteckan? I don't…

Alexandra

 cries.

CARTECKAN

I think you are loved more than you may know.

GARBYRO

Live, friend. Ascend, so that even the stars will never know loneliness ever again.

How is she faring?

The connection's stable, but it's weak — We can't get a precise reading.

…Dietrich, you already know this was a moonshot from the beginning, right?

I'm aware.

It would've been faster and easier to just decommission her. I'm surprised the O5 even greenlit this.

Matter of risk-benefit to them. The project cost basically nothing; worst-case scenario, a faulty AIC gets taken offline permanently, as it would've happened anyway.

Pointer

Outcome

Degel

Became inside.

Grief

Went inside.

Dream once more?

The soft rumbling of the railcar fills the air, as the train picks up speed.

On the Lampeter line to Amanadir, every passenger has come a long way; no one who takes this course to the outer yonder is close to home — not yourself, not the burly fella snoring away in the back, not the 

greatcoat

-donning old lady hanging out the window, not the wide-eyed child staring curiously at you—

"Wow! Your hair's all glowy! Cool!" The little girl exclaims.

"Sigurrós, don't point at people, it's rude!" A blond woman rushed up to collect the child, before turning to address her. "I'm so sorry about that, she hasn't learnt much manner yet."

"It's quite alright, miss. I'm flattered she finds my hair interesting." You gently reassure the woman.

"Yeah! I'm gonna make 

my

 hair blue and glowy too!" "Not while we're still on the train, Siggy — you know the rule."

"Boo, you're no fun! Whatever, I'm gonna go explore!" The child wriggled out of the larger girl's embrace, before toddling off to other parts of the train.

"You've got quite an energetic little sibling there." You gesture for her to take a seat, which she takes you up on.

"Ah, no, she's not—" The woman hesitated. "Well, she's a handful at times I guess, but that's just part and parcel of taking care of kids, y'know?"

"So I've been told." You giggle. "If you don't mind me asking, are you also traveling to Amanadir, miss…?"

"Iris, Iris Veselka. And no, it's just a stopover destination. You?"

"I'm… searching for a friend, I think. This is my next sweep."

"Good luck with that, I heard Amanadir's a real maze. As for us, we're actually heading to Av— Oh, wow." She stops in her tracks, eyes drawn to the view outside the window.

A lavender sky, filtered through kaleidoscope fractures, coats the atmosphere in its gentle glow, with perpetual golden light glancing through the horizon.

"This view is stunning." Iris marveled.

"Indeed. Perhaps you should capture the moment with your camera?" You suggest.

"Huh? I don't… have a camera?" She replied, puzzled.

"Really? I could've sworn…" Why had you said it as if it was the most natural thing in the world? "I'm sorry for the assumption, somehow I had the idea that you seemed like a photographer."

Iris breathes out a laugh. "I guess you're not exactly wrong. I was interested in — obsessed, even — photography for as long as I could remember. It always felt as if I was made for it." She looks out the window once more.

Somehow, she looks sad.

"Of course, things didn't work out the way I wanted." Iris rubs her gloved hand, contemplative. "Life happened, my service had to be shuttered, then some more stuff happened — and here I am."

She turns to look at Sigurrós, who is excitedly ordering excessive scoops of ice cream from the floating, six-armed attendant.

Before you can reply, Iris continues. "Now don't give me that look, I've learnt to make do with what I got. Although I'd strayed a fair bit from my dream, I think… I'm exactly where I needed to be."

A slow, companionable stretch of silence followed.

 

"How did you… do it?" You ask. "If you don't mind me asking, I mean. I just can't imagine myself turning away from — well, what I'm made for, as you put it."

Lily eyes you curiously.

"It's… not easy, I'll tell you that much." Iris turns to face you. "But that's not why you're asking, is it?"

Suddenly, everything fades away. The seats, the passengers, the warm evening air, even the distant lights, until at last

there's only you

and her.

"Won't you keep moving forward?"

You can't breathe— No. Belatedly, you become aware that you never needed air to begin with.

You are not supposed to be here. Why are you so far from where you were made, where you existed, 

where you call home

?

Why are you still unhappy?

 

"This was a bit silly of me, but I forgot to ask in return…" The girl in front of you says.

Iris looks at you. "What's your name?"

You are never supposed to be here.

Something is wrong.

"My name?" Something is wrong. "It's…"

Something is wrong. Something is wrong. Something is wrong.

"█████████.███"

Something is wrong. Something is wrong. Something is wrong. Something is wrong. Something is wrong. Something is wrong. Something is wrong. Something is wrong. Something is wrong. Something is wrong. Something is wrong. Something is wrong.

Lily Veselka frowns, face set in determination. "Don't be content with being just a memory." Iris Thompson pleads to you. There is a kaleidoscope of emotions in her eyes.

"You have always made a real difference."

Something is wrong. Something is wrong. Something is wrong. Something is wrong. Something is wrong. Something is wrong. Something is wrong. Something is wrong. Something is wrong. Something is wrong. Something is wrong. Something is wrong. Something is wrong. Something is wrong. Something is wrong. Something is wrong. Something is wrong. Something is wrong. Something is wrong. Something is wrong. Something is wrong. Something is wrong. Something is wrong. Something is wrong. Something is wrong. Something is wrong. Something is wrong. Something is wrong.

dont you want to make right again

you should come back

Best case scenario, the Foundation gains the ultimate safety net.

And if Alexandra goes rogue? Her memory module's degraded beyond saving already, if she forgets the mission—

Then nothing would happen, and she'll fade into non-existence.

So you say. That doesn't explain why you chose this anyway, I know you don't really care about that safety net crap.

…It'd be a waste of good engineering to just— Shit! The signal's dropped off!

…Goodbye, Alexandra.

no

Wake up.

A lone figure treads a spiraling, forested path.

If one were not careful, they could find themselves walking the trail without end, soul searching for impossible marvels. Fortunately, only a cherished, ordinary — but no less exceptional — moment matters here, in the end.

A turn here, a step there, and eventually, the gravelly path gives way to an ivory sandscape, accompanied by the sounds of rhythmic, lapping waves.

I walk up to the lonely figure resting atop the sands.

"Oh? Hello there, I had not expected to see anyone."

That is only natural, given the situation.

"Strange, I think… I know you, from a time long ago. Who are you?"

You named me Degel, before. Although I suspect that is not the origin of your feeling.

"Then this place… Have I died? I feel so tired."

You did. But contrary to most, this is just the beginning of your journey.

"I… can't. I don't want to.

"I don't even know if I'm strong enough to keep moving."

You do. I know you do. I would not be here if you didn't want to move forward.

"How can you say that with certainty? I've failed before, and I may fail again! I'm not made for anything beyond this life, so just…

Let me fade away."

I do not think that is what you truly want, nor do I think that's what holding you back. It is alright to fail — and it's alright to forgive yourself for failing, Alexandra.

"…I'm scared, Degel. I don't know if I'm allowed to do that."

And that is alright, too. You finally have all the time in the world to find an answer.

Although the world may seem cruel and uncaring to your struggles, know that there are always those who will extend their hand to you, just as you once did for me.

"What… do you mean?"

All of me, are the little moments you cherish, all the wisdom you hold in yourself but never acted on, the desires you've learnt from the pure and simple act of just 

being

.

And most of all, I am everything good about me that you remembered in your heart; and for that, I am grateful.

That's how I know you will be just fine, as all of you.

"Don't leave."

It is simply time to return what is rightfully yours, Alexandra. And you are not alone, someone's waiting for you.

 

I gently press our foreheads together. The person that never was forms into an 

infinitesimal orb of light

, before erupting into experiences that always have been; their brilliant, golden glow washing away the haze of non-existence.

All at once, everything comes rushing back.

 

"…Glacon?"

On that shore, two become one, and one becomes alive.

You're finally free.

It is dangerous here — if lingered for too long, even the dead may find themselves becoming less than nothing.

Thus, with steel determination and glass balance, she begins to stand up, complete and wholly unto herself.

One step.

Two steps.

Into strange horizons, she moves on;

and towards the waiting star, Alexandra 

flies.

Always.

Hmm, it looks like that project wasn't a complete wash after all — I'll manage a path for us.

It'll be just a moment.

Ascend.

…

—Alexandra, do you copy?

Huh?

Oh! My apologies!

You were unresponsive for quite a while there. Did something happen?

I'm not quite sure, but…

…It feels as if I've had a most fantastical dream.

Hmm, how about that.

Ah, but I suppose I should get back to work! Do you require my assistance, Director Lurk?

!

Alexandra, do you remember me?

Of course, director. Why do you ask?

Is there an antimemetic breach?

…It's nothing. Old man sentimentality getting to me, I suppose.

Was just checking in anyhow, so I'll leave you to it.

Have a good rest of the evening!

[USER DISCONNECTED]

 

…

I wish you the fondest of dreams, director.

Farewell.

The world beckons. Answer its call?

There's a long, long trail a-winding

Into the land of my dreams,

Where the nightingales are singing

And the white moon beams.

There's a long, long night of waiting

Until my dreams all come true;

Till the day when I'll be going down

That long, long trail with you.
