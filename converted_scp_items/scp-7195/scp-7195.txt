 How'd you get in here?

 Kitty cat?

 Third Encounter, 

Site-58

TRANSCRIPT

«BEGIN LOG»

Thorley is about to eat a microwaved salami and cheese sandwich. The ingredients used to make the sandwich have not yet been put away.

As they are about to take a bite, a meow is heard.

Thorley:

 Hey kitty.

SCP-7195 sits on the floor near Thorley, looks up expectantly, and meows.

Thorley:

 What?

SCP-7195 meows an extended meow which dips into a lower pitch before returning to normal.

Thorley:

 Food? I don't have cat food… Salami?

Thorley rips a tiny piece of salami from the salami package, and feeds it to SCP-7195. SCP-7195 eats the salami.

Thorley picks their sandwich back up, readying to bite it.

SCP-7195 meows in the same manner as previously.

Thorley sets down the sandwich.

Thorley:

 I'm sorry.

Thorley stands up.

Thorley:

 I'll go get some. Be right back.

Thorley exits the office, glancing back at SCP-7195 as they do.

Once Thorley has exited, SCP-7195 jumps onto their desk.

SCP-7195 sniffs their sandwich, then the component ingredients.

SCP-7195 begins chewing on a bag of bagels.

SCP-7195 breaches the bagel sack, taking a single bite of every bagel, then exits from view.

Thorley returns with a bag of cat food.

Thorley notices the lack of a cat.

Thorley:

 Kitty?

Thorley fails to find SCP-7195, but notices the bitemarks on their bagel, consistent with a feline of SCP-7195's size.

Thorley throws away the damaged bagels.

Notes: Following this encounter Liaison Thorley purchased cat food, a food bowl, a water bowl, a litter box, cat litter, and cat toys in anticipation of the next encounter.

Liaison Thorley also received pet care tips from the Department of Zoological Studies Vice Chair Dr. Faran Caraway and was able to subsequently determine that SCP-7195 was male and had been neutered.

Following the previous log SCP-7195 began to visit Alex Thorley's office more frequently, and for longer durations, often eating, playing, or keeping Liaison Thorley company.

Thorley has similarly been unable to equip SCP-7195 with a collar or tracking chip, though SCP-7195 has allowed the administration and application of medical care by Thorley when needed.

On 05/27 SCP-7195 was witnessed wearing a cat collar. The collar's pet tag heavily resembled a Foundation Star for Bravery in Combat, listed SCP-7195's name as "Agent Kitty H. Cat", and displayed a valid, though non-existent, Level 2 Foundation authentication ID.

SCP-7195 has not been noted with a collar since.
