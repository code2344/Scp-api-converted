##### **Special Containment Procedures**
Site-23 web crawler Delta-500 ("Discover-Bot") is to continuously monitor the web for mentions of SCP-5567. Should mentions be discovered, they are to be promptly removed.
Any discovered copies of SCP-5567 are to be kept in Site-23 anomalous storage Unit-12. Personnel wishing to access SCP-5567 with clearance level below SCP-5567/2 must gain permission from project director Researcher Oliver Crane or project lead Senior Researcher Kelly Apple.
**Post 19/12/2019 Additions:** No physical changes may be made to any copy of SCP-5567 upon discovery without direct permission from project director Researcher Crane. Any person found guilty of doing so will be removed from working with SCP-5567, and reported to Site Director Lilith Miles.
**Update 25/09/2019:** Due to the unknown nature of SCP-5567-1's anomalous development, testing has been temporarily suspended. Only the aforementioned personnel may access SCP-5567.
##### **Description**
[![Pic](https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--resized-images/scp-5567/Pic/medium.jpg)](https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-5567/Pic)
SCP-5567 title card.
SCP-5567 is a direct-to-video, subtitled, pilot episode of a Japanese anime titled _"海辺の謎"_[1](javascript:;). A label on the back cover claims it was distributed by a believed-to-be nonexistent "East Blue Productions"; investigation is ongoing.
The plot of SCP-5567 involves a detective named Toshiro Arikawa (SCP-5567-1) investigating a spike in missing person cases in the fictional seaside town of Michikomio, Japan. Although locals claim a yokai[2](javascript:;) is responsible, Toshiro remains skeptical. Every twenty-four-hours following the previous successful viewing of SCP-5567, the culprit of the disappearances changes, along with corresponding scenes and other details relating to the mystery.
**Discovery of SCP-5567-1**
SCP-5567-1 is an emergent awareness embedded in the character of Detective Arikawa, which developed upon repetitive viewing during preliminary Foundation testing.[3](javascript:;)
During testing, SCP-5567-1 gradually became aware of its status as a fictional character. Evidence of this included:
  * Dialogue by SCP-5567-1, considered unfitting to the scene
  * SCP-5567-1 appearing late to scenes
  * SCP-5567-1 not appearing in scenes
  * SCP-5567-1 responding to remarks made by Foundation personnel in the room[4](javascript:;)
  * SCP-5567-1 failing to speak for extended periods of time

Testing has revealed SCP-5567-1 is aware of when SCP-5567 is being watched, its place as a character in a direct to video anime, and the year SCP-5567 was supposedly created.[5](javascript:;) Additionally, testing has revealed that SCP-5567-1 is aware of previous iterations of itself, interactions with viewers, and plot resolutions. For more information uncovered during testing with SCP-5567-1, see the addendums below.

> **Interviewed:** SCP-5567-1
> **Interviewer:** Dr. Kelly Apple, Researcher Daichi Fox
> **Objective:** To learn what exactly SCP-5567-1 knows about itself, its creation, and the world around it.
> **Note:** As SCP-5567-1 can only communicate in Japanese, Researcher Fox, fluent in English and Japanese, translated for both parties.
> **< Begin Log>**
> * * *
> **Dr. Apple:** I am only going to say this once. Detective Arikawa, you will now be known as SCP-5567-1. Do you understand me?
> _[SCP-5567-1 leans back in his chair and looks to the sky.]_
> **SCP-5567-1:** The voices in my head seem quite active today. Maybe I should go to a shrink like Aoi tells me to.
> **Dr. Apple:** My name is Dr. Apple, and I'm here to interview you. Next to me is Researcher Fox. Please be more responsive to the questions.
> **SCP-5567-1:** Can't right now, doc. My schedule is a bit backed up at the moment, what with the murders and all.
> _[SCP-5567-1 taps his pen against his notepad, and sighs.]_
> **SCP-5567-1:** The murders…
> **Dr. Apple:** SCP-5567-1, I need you to answer me—
> **SCP-5567-1:** I was not alive before. I would have appreciated some company within Michikomio. Outside company is not unwanted, but you seem quite incompetent and a bore to listen to. Talk to me when you get a better doctor to do it for you. And please, my name is Toshiro Arikawa.
> _[At this point, SCP-5567-1 looks at the camera and gently pushes it away. By the next perspective shift, SCP-5567-1 has disappeared from the frame.]_
> * * *
> **< End Log>**
> **Observations:** SCP-5567-1 does not appear to be capable of viewing observers. How it knows that it is being watched is currently unknown.

Hello Kelly! I'm still landing my footing here, but a useful phrase we have around the office in my division is "a content anomaly is a contained anomaly". Maybe try using his name, many anomalies cooperate simply by hearing their given name. We need to gain his trust, as he seems very wary around us.
See you tomorrow!

Daichi, I appreciate the incentive, but trust me in this. We can use its name if necessary, but we do not need to bend to the anomaly's will. Try to learn from me.

> _[Detective Arikawa is sitting on a piece of driftwood on the beach, attempting to light a cigarette. A stormfront is brewing, though the sunset is beautiful.]_
> **Fox:** Hello, Detective Arikawa, I was wondering if I could speak with you.
> **Arikawa:** Jesus, can a man take a smoke in peace? I already told you doc, I don't want nothing to do—
> **Fox:** No, no, you misunderstand, sir. I was merely a translator for my supervisor, Apple. My name is Daichi Fox.
> **Arikawa:** Ah. I suppose I could give someone new a chance. Especially since you're using my name. My _real_ name.
> _[Arikawa takes a deep drag of the cigarette and exhales, watching the cloud drift away.]_
> **Arikawa:** Now go on, say your piece. I'll leave when I'm done with this cigarette.
> **Fox:** Oh… okay, ah…. How did you feel when you first gained— first became aware of your surroundings.
> **Arikawa:** Shitty.
> **Fox:** Okay… what do you want to do with your life?
> **Arikawa:** Well, I would kill myself, but I wouldn't know what to do after that. _[takes a drag]_
> **Fox:** Not that much of a planner, eh?
> **Arikawa:** What can I say, I'm more of an action man than a thinking man.
> _[Thundering is heard in the distance.]_
> **Fox:** Not a bad way to be. Aren't you afraid it's going to rain?
> **Arikawa:** Nah, it never rains around here this time. A little further down the coast, maybe, but never went out that far.
> **Fox:** Why not?
> **Arikawa:** Heh, I'm suicidal, not insane. Traveled down the coast for a shopping trip one time, halfway to the next town I started unravelling. _[takes a drag]_ Could feel ink dripping from my back, the car almost falling apart from the weight of an animator's pencil pressing against it. I didn't feel… finished. Turned around like a _[chuckles]_ fox with its tail between its legs.
> **Fox:** You say that so casually. That you're suicidal.
> **Arikawa:** It's nothing to make a fuss of, not to me.
> _[Arikawa takes one final drag of his cigarette, and crushes it beneath his heel.]_
> **Arikawa:** Well, there's that. Nice talking to you, kid.
> **Fox:** You too. See you around.
> * * *
> **< End Log>**
> **Observations:** The anomaly appears capable of aiming the camera to focus on it at all times.

I read your interview with SCP-5567-1 yesterday. You were not productive, Daichi, and very unprofessional transcript at that. Flowery language does not make a transcript. Talking to a construct about its feelings is getting us nowhere. We need to learn exactly what it can do, and what it knows about it.
You are poisoning the well of research before we can try and take a drink. Watch and learn from me, Fox.

Kelly, you're being quite cold. If we gain his trust, he's more likely to cooperate, at least from what I have picked up on. If I see him closing up, I'll try to smooth things out next interview you do.

> **Arikawa:** If I don't solve a case, twenty-four-hours later, there's a new one. A little girl is ripped apart in front of me and I'll watch her buy candy from a vendor the next day. All I do is give them a temporary good ending.
> **Fox:** Then why do you still do it?
> **Arikawa:** Just because I'm suffering doesn't mean these husks have to. It doesn't feel right to leave things because _I'm_ upset. The least I can do is avenge them, maybe fulfill their spirits' need for vengeance, if only for a little while.

[Stepping Back](javascript:;)
**To:** kellyapple@SCiPnet  
**From:** daichifox@SCiPnet  
**Subject:** Stepping back
* * *
I believe it is in the best interest of the case for me to distance myself from SCP-5567-1. After receiving the memo, I was forced to realize that I have been _too_ focused on trying to gain his trust. Although I'd like to be there to watch the progression of the anomaly and be there for him if he needs it, it seems like he's willing to cooperate without my advice at this point. I'll let you take the reins again. Contact me if he shuts down, if you'd like.
**To:** daichifox@SCiPnet  
**From:** kellyapple@SCiPnet  
**Subject:** Re:Stepping back
* * *
Noted. I'll inform Oliver of your decision ASAP. I was only ever trying to look out for you, Daichi. I'll be sure to let SCP-5567-1 know as well. And I'll ask for your help if it's needed.

Thanks. Do stick to calling him Arikawa, it will do wonders to his cooperation. Trust me.

Right.
##### **Addendum 5567 Status Update**
**Observer:** Dr. Kelly Apple, Dr. Marvin Waters
**Interview(s) Summary:** SCP-5567-1 initially expressed irritation that Researcher Fox was no longer interviewing it. It was reluctantly explained that Researcher Fox chose to stop directly interacting with SCP-5567-1. It appeared to take comfort in the fact that Researcher Fox had not been forced to stop interacting with it, finding his reasoning "noble" which aided in its further cooperation.  

* * *
  
**Progress as of 09/09/2019:** SCP-5567-1 has been observed to have gained full/near full control of itself and its surroundings. Sapience and anomalous properties seem to be progressing at a steady pace, relative to number of interations SCP-5567 has undergone.
— Dr. Marvin Waters
**Update as of 12/09/2019:** SCP-5567-1's sapience and anomalous properties seem to be progressing in larger amounts than previously documented.
New properties include:
  * The ability to change which predetermined scene is occurring at will (if it chooses to partake in such scene)[7](javascript:;)
  * The ability to make objects appear

Additionally, SCP-5567-1's physical appearance has been altered. It now looks disheveled, opposed to the clean-cut appearance seen previously.
— Dr. Kelly Apple

**Updates as of 25/09/2019:** SCP-5567-1 has become almost non-responsive to Foundation personnel. Although no current threat to containment has been made, it has been decided that SCP-5567-1 testing will be brought to an indefinite halt. Contact Researcher Crane or Dr. Apple for any questions regarding this decision.

I told you not to get close to him, why did you have to push it?

I just tried talking to him, and I don't know.
He just seemed so brave and kind. I wanted him to know he wasn't alone. That he didn't have to go through life alone.
I didn't want him to live in a world where no one cared.
I wanted him to know I cared.

Did you ever consider that you were putting him in more pain than he deserved? All those times you forced him to talk to you, forcing the tape to play, you forced him to see his friends turn into horrible monsters and ghouls. He saw his friends die over and over.
You made him miserable.

I didn't mean to. 
I tried distancing myself from him as if that would help, but it didn't. I didn't want him to be lonely anymore, I thought I could fix that.
Fix him, at least.
I just wanted to help him.
##### **Incident Log 5567-19/12/2019**
  
On the 19th of December, 2019, during an unrelated containment breach, the entire site experienced a cascading power failure. After power was restored, it was discovered that substantial modifications had been made to SCP-5567, including the physical removal of a portion of the tape, which included the timestamp that the murders occurred within. It is unknown who, if anyone, is responsible for this vandalism. The emergent intelligence has been unaffected by the alteration.
##### **Post Incident 19/12/2019**
Researcher Fox put in for a transfer after the above incident, which was granted. Upon vacating his lodgings at the Site, the following correspondence was found.[8](javascript:;)
> Arikawa-San
> While I am sure you won’t get to read this, possibly some member of the research staff will take pity on me and read it to you. I won’t take too much of your time.
> I sincerely apologize to you. While I understand I violated your boundaries, at the time, I felt as if I was doing so for the right reasons. Please be assured that I am no longer a part of the research staff here, and you won't have to interact with me anymore. I am transferring because I feel I have lost my objective, and want to give you peace of mind.
> I hope someday you will come to forgive me.
> All my love,
> Daichi Fox
Upon locating this correspondence, Dr. Apple requested a full enquiry be made into Researcher Fox’s behavior. The letter was not read to SCP-5567-1.
