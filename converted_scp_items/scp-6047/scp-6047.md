A bloom of SCP-6047 outside the perimeter of Zone-SCP-6047.
**Item #:** SCP-6047
**Object Class:** Euclid
**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-6047 is contained within the limits of the property where it was initially discovered, Zone-SCP-6047. The property is surrounded by an 8-meter tall wall of modular concrete slabs, an experimental new method of rapidly containing similar anomalous entities. The wall is fitted with barbed wire and security camera systems. Any and all new plant growth outside the containment area suspected to originate from within the anomaly is to be sterilized through the application of boiling salt water and/or incineration. Use of defoliants is currently prohibited until further notice following Incident-6047-AO. The perimeter wall must be patrolled once daily with ground-penetrating radar to detect any root structures attempting to dig below the wall. These must be excavated and promptly severed or incinerated. Efforts are currently underway to deepen the wall foundations with additional concrete slabs in areas not blocked by city infrastructure, but - as it is currently unknown how deep SCP-6047 roots can burrow - site personnel should anticipate conducting GPR patrols for the foreseeable future. MTF-Theta-4 "Gardeners" was requested to assist in preventing the anomaly's spread, but as of now, they are spread too thin investigating multiple other anomalies. As such, a team of agents currently stationed at Zone-SCP-6047 was tasked with conducting sorties within the anomaly to better understand its nature.
**Description:** SCP-6047 is an area of massively overgrown and abnormally large plant life currently infesting a 3-acre area of land in San Jose, Costa Rica. The most apparent anomalous trait of SCP-6047's plantlife is that it appears to be an amalgamation of various species, namely _Bixa orellana_ , _Trifolium repens_ , _Mirabilis jalapa_ , and _Rosa kordesii_ , with each species of flower originating from the same system of stems. The flowers have completely enveloped every vehicle, tree, and building within the perimeter of Zone-SCP-6047, creating a jungle environment with sufficient density to significantly lower visibility within the area. While these flowers exhibit no further anomalous properties on their own, they are potentially a form of sensory organ utilized by SCP-6047-1.
SCP-6047-1 is a large humanoid entity - roughly 3 meters in height - comprised entirely of plant matter. The entity's body shape closely resembles that of a muscular human male with pale green skin and a 35cm wide _Rosa kordesii_ bloom serving as its face. The entity possesses bulky arms and large hands ending in talons reminiscent of rose thorns, and its outer biceps and forearms are studded with rose thorns varying in size from 1-5cm. The entity's coloration transitions from pale green to a deep crimson around the upper back, biceps, forearms, and hands, as well as the lower legs - which are also studded with thorns. Upon close examination, faint grooves can be seen interlacing through SCP-6047-1's skin, indicating its body is comprised of intertwining vines molded into a humanoid shape. Tendrils of amalgamated SCP-6047 plants coil around SCP-6047-1's body, constantly moving and swaying as if probing the surrounding air. Notably, as of Incident-6047-AO, SCP-6047-1's skin was reportedly dotted with multiple small, wilted and brown patches around the midsection and upper torso. The entity appeared greatly discomforted by these wilted patches, constantly scratching them as if it were a form of skin condition.
SCP-6047-1 possesses the ability to disassemble its body into its constituent vines before vanishing into the undergrowth of SCP-6047 and reassembling in a nearby location. It also appears to direct the growth of SCP-6047 vegetation, causing tendrils to attack or ensnare designated targets. SCP-6047-1, despite having no visible eyes, is apparently acutely aware of the positions of any living organism entering the area of SCP-6047. It is theorized the entity can sense when physical contact is made with any 6047 instances, and thus uses the plants as a form of touch-based sensory organ or alarm system.
**Discovery:** SCP-6047 first emerged in the parking lot of an auto-repair shop in San Jose Costa Rica on 9/6/2022. The SCP-6047 vegetation's rapid spread across surrounding buildings and vehicles resulted in multiple car accidents and at least 3 fatalities. Pedestrians caught within the radius of the SCP-6047 expansion, particularly those within the auto-repair shop, were quickly ensnared in the overgrowth. It is currently unknown how many are still alive, but multiple emergency hotline calls have been logged from within the perimeter of Zone-SCP-6047. It is believed that 56 people are currently missing within the confines of SCP-6047.
**Addendum 6047-1, Incident-Report-6047-AO**
[\+ Show Incident-Report-6047-AO](javascript:;)
[\- Close](javascript:;)
During the construction of Zone-SCP-6047's modular wall complex, a "wave" of SCP-6047 approached several workers on the east side of the enclosure, where the walls had not been fully lowered into position. Agents armed with flamethrowers were able to reduce the rate of SCP-6047's spread, but the vegetation began attempting to flank the incendiary teams as if guided by a higher intelligence. As a countermeasure, five Agents equipped with CBRNA[1](javascript:;) protective gear began dispensing "2,4-D" and "2,4,5-T" defoliants at the approaching overgrowth from handheld dispersal units. The SCP-6047 vegetation rapidly began wilting upon contact with the defoliants, far more quickly than expected.
Immediately upon the defoliant's contact with SCP-6047, a loud roar emanated from deep within the anomalous brush 300m from the crew. Approximately 15 seconds later, a collection of 5-cm thick tendrils of unidentified species lashed out from the undergrowth and began coiling together into a large humanoid entity, later classified as SCP-6047-1. SCP-6047-1 rapidly approached the defoliant Agents, displaying inhuman agility and abnormal physical strength as it proceeded to destroy the Agents' dispersal units with unarmed strikes before they could open fire. Agents drew their sidearms but were quickly ensnared in new SCP-6047 tendrils, rendering them completely immobile. Incendiary teams attempted to offer assistance with suppressive flame dispersion, but SCP-6047-1 advanced through the flames and began lifting each incendiary Agent before throwing them at the construction crew and vehicles, causing multiple injuries and substantial equipment damage, but no fatalities.
Once all engaged Foundation personnel were either immobilized, incapacitated, or taking cover, SCP-6047-1 lifted the defoliant Agents in a collection of tendrils before carrying them further into SCP-6047. Likely as a result of the anomalously strong grip of the SCP-6047 tendrils, each Agent's communications equipment was damaged severely and ceased contact with Site receivers. As SCP-6047-1 only reacted upon contact with the defoliant chemicals and seemed focused on the Agents dispersing said chemicals, the use of defoliants to halt the spread of SCP-6047 was suspended following this incident. Notably, SCP-6047-1, at the time of the incident, appeared significantly more wilted and unhealthy compared to footage captured two days later.

**Addendum 6047-2, SCP-6047 Exploration Logs: 1-3**  
Following Incident-6047-AO, a collection of on-site agents was assigned to conduct sorties within the bounds of SCP-6047 in an effort to locate SCP-6047-1 and the captured Agents. Team members were equipped with CBRNA protective gear, standard Foundation flamethrowers, multiple bodycams, and spare communications equipment, along with standard-issue machetes and assault weaponry. The following is a transcript of bodycam footage and audio recordings from Agent Yvelis Aguilar of the SCP-6047 Exploration Team:
  * [_Exploration Log: 1_](javascript:;)
  * [_Exploration Log: 2_](javascript:;)
  * [_Exploration Log: 3_](javascript:;)

**Participating Agents:** _Alan Elkhart_ (Team Lead), _Yvelis Aguilar_ (Second Lead), _Alvarez Fuentes_ (Incendiary), _Lyn Juno_ (Incendiary), _Eloise Simon_ (Navigation - Simon had previously visited the auto-repair shop multiple times while off-duty, and thus her recollection of the local area's layout was deemed essential)  
**Location:** Zone-SCP-6047  
**Date:** 9/8/2022
* * *
**< Begin Log:>**
  * _Muffled rustling noises._

  * **Aguilar:** Alright, we are a-go.

  * **Juno:** Good, I knew you'd eventually figure out how to work a radio!

  * **Aguilar:** Hah, fuck off, Juno. Let's get moving.

  * _Scraping sounds are audible as modular wall section lowers into place behind team, effectively sealing them inside._

  * _Density of SCP-6047 plantlife is such that identifying surrounding structures is almost impossible barring close examination after multiple machete strikes. Vegetation in this area appears to rest atop ground rather than emerging from it. Vegetation reaches 2 meters in height in various areas, mostly around enveloped objects._

  * **Simon:** Okay, I can vaguely make out where the street is. Greenery or not, it's kinda hard to hide a bunch of multi-story apartment buildings. From this point, I estimate we're a quarter-mile out.

  * **Elkhart:** A quarter-mile of walking through fucking rose bushes. Thornlessâ€¦ rose bushes.

  * **Juno:** Anyone wanna place bets on potential threats? I bet this thing's got weaponized thorns.

  * **Aguilar:** Thorns, almost certainly, if these rose blooms are any indication. The mixed flowers sharing vines is definitely telling. If this thing is capable of "reshuffling" plant DNA, it might have access to a wide variety of plant-based attacks. Poisons, thorns, potentially even "explosive" seed pods.

  * **Juno:** Whoa, when did you become such a nerd? You're not even in Theta-4.

  * **Aguilar:** Dress for the job you want. I've read up on all the case files I had the clearance for, and I was originally a biology major. Plus I like gardening.

  * **Elkhart:** You mentioned thorns, but I'm not seeing any.

  * **Simon:** Maybe they're touch-sensitive traps? Like the uhâ€¦ the hairs on a Venus Flytrap?

  * **Aguilar:** The fact that we haven't set off anything yet indicates the vines themselves aren't the trigger, whatever the case. Keep an eye out for any new plant life that looks out of place - well, compared to the vines at least.

  * _Team begins traversing through dense SCP-6047 underbrush with their machetes with Simon and Elkhart in the lead. Progress is sluggish due to the density of vegetation and obscured obstructions littering the path ahead. After 20 minutes, the team has managed to traverse 30 meters._

  * **Fuentes:** Uh, guys, is anyone else getting snagged?

  * **Elkhart:** Snagged?

  * _Aguilar turns back to inspect Fuentes. The foliage around Fuentes has taken on a red hue around the stems. Upon closer examination, the stems have begun sprouting blood-red thorns resembling those of a common rose, and Fuentes's boots are ensnared by the thorns at various points._

  * _Aguilar attempts to kneel down and free Fuentes, but as her hands near the thorny vines, she notices the thorns are beginning to spread radially out from Fuentes's position, traveling down the lengths of every vine in contact with Fuentes's boots._

  * **Aguilar:** What theâ€¦ the thornsâ€¦ they're spreading in reverse, from the flowers backward down the stems. That's not normal growth, they're definitely responding to something.

  * **Elkhart:** Waitâ€¦ hey, Fuentes, lift your left foot and show us the sole. Aguilar, don't let him fall over.

  * _Aguilar secures her grip on Fuentes's vest as he begins raising his left foot, revealing the crushed remains of an unknown red fruit. The fruit, despite being largely destroyed, is still connected to one of the SCP-6047 tendrils._

  * **Elkhart:** Fuentes, take your machete and _carefully_ scrape as much of that off your boot as you can.

  * _Fuentes begins using the tip of his machete to dislodge the crushed fruit from his boot, leaving only faint residue. In the process of removing the fruit, the connecting vine becomes severed. While the thorns do not appear to retract, new thorns stop being produced the instant the fruit is severed from the vine._

  * **Aguilar:** Okay, we found our touch-based traps. Seems damaging the fruits sends a signal to all local vines to initiate a threat-response.

  * **Elkhart:** Still seems weirdly sophisticated for a plant.

  * **Aguilar:** The presence of SCP-6047-1 indicates there might be a greater intelligence involved here. We might've gotten lucky this trap was relatively tame.

  * **Elkhart:** Alright, you heard the lady. Don't touch any plants aside from the flowering vines we've already seen. At least we know those aren't immediately dangerous.

  * _Aguilar assists Fuentes in lifting himself over the barrier of thorny vines. Team continues on for another 10 minutes largely unimpeded. Upon review of the footage, a large red flower can be seen within the passenger-side window of a crashed sedan nearby before disappearing from view._

  * _Aguilar's attention is suddenly drawn to a sound resembling faint whimpering approximately 10 meters ahead of her position._

  * **Aguilar:** Hey, anyone hear that? I think we got survivors.

  * _Elkhart and Aguilar begin approaching the source of the noise. Within an overturned SUV embedded halfway in the window of a storefront, two figures can be distinguished. Upon closer examination, figures are an adult female and a child. Both occupants are pinned awkwardly to the interior roof of the vehicle, apparently ensnared by the vines while attempting to crawl from their seats. Occupants have sustained minor injuries, but are responsive and conscious._

  * _Aguilar kneels near the shattered passenger's side window and begins conversing with the woman in Spanish. After reassuring the vehicle's occupants, she begins using her machete to sever the vines surrounding the doors of the vehicle before pulling them open._

  * **Juno:** Hey Aguilar, let me do it. I'm the smallest.

  * **Aguilar:** I'll cover you.

  * _Aguilar takes Juno's flamethrower and backpack as Juno begins crawling into the totaled SUV to retrieve the survivors._

  * _Loud rustling suddenly erupts from the foliage in all directions, centering on the overturned SUV._

  * **Elkhart:** Shit, everyone take positions around the SUV! Aguilar, drop the flamethrower. No time to put it on.

  * _Team forms a perimeter around the van and attempts to detect the source of the rustling. Juno is still inside the vehicle attempting to free the occupants from their seatbelts and ensnaring vines. Aguilar, having climbed up on top of the SUV, can clearly see a ring of intensely vibrating foliage encircling their position. Rustling gets louder and louder before abruptly stopping 60 seconds after initiation._

  * **Aguilar:** Guysâ€¦ it's here. It's definitely here- THERE!

  * _10 meters from the SUV, several thicker tendrils rise from the foliage and begin intertwining, forming a large humanoid shape. Once SCP-6047-1 completes its formation, it begins approaching the SUV at a casual pace. Simon, the closest to the entity, raises her firearm and holds out a hand in a "stop" gesture._

  * **Simon:** YOU, STAY BACK OR I WILL FIRE!

  * _SCP-6047-1 appears to hesitate slightly, slowing its pace but not stopping its approach. Once SCP-6047-1 enters within 3 meters of Simon, it raises one hand up towards her. Multiple vines begin rising from the underbrush around Simon's position._

  * **Aguilar:** Simonâ€¦ don'tâ€¦ moveâ€¦

  * _Suddenly an unidentified male runs out from an alleyway adjacent to the storefront the SUV is embedded in. The man rapidly traverses through the dense underbrush until he is within 3 meters of SCP-6047-1 before holding up a small cylindrical canister and spraying the entity with an unidentified chemical. Immediately SCP-6047-1 recoils as if in pain, staggering backward 2 meters. The area where the chemicals made contact with the entity already rapidly becomes significantly more wilted and brown. The surface of the entity's skin begins rippling as its limbs twitch and shudder. The man begins shouting in Spanish at the entity in a threatening tone, telling it to "go away" and "die already"._

  * **Elkhart:** Simon, grab him and BACK UP!

  * _A thundering roar fills the air as SCP-6047-1 rapidly advances towards the pair and rears up to strike. Simon steps before the man to shield him as SCP-6047-1's fist collides with her midsection, launching her and the man backward and through the broken window of the storefront._

  * **Fuentes:** WHERE DID THAT IDIOT COME FROM!? FUCK!

  * _Fuentes begins firing upon the entity with his flamethrower as he backs up towards the storefront. SCP-6047-1's body becomes charred by the fire, but it does not seem to react. SCP-6047-1 reaches out its arm, which begins rapidly unwinding into various vines that lash out and coil around Fuentes and his flamethrower. Fuentes is unable to retreat or drop the weapon, and his finger is stuck on the trigger by the strong grip of the vines._

  * _As Elkhart attempts to advance and aid Fuentes, the vines begin pulling Fuentes's arms downwards, causing the stream of fire from his flamethrower to advance closer to his position. Soon Fuentes's arms are angled in such a way to where the flamethrower is aimed directly downwards, projecting its flames around his feet. While his CBRNA suit is designed to withstand intense heat, the prolonged exposure to the napalm begins melting the suit's outer lining._

  * **Fuentes:** FUCK, FUCK, FUCK! LETâ€¦ GO!

  * _Aguilar opens fire on the entity with her assault rifle. While multiple holes can be seen piercing through its flesh, it does not visibly react. Elkhart draws his machete and slices through the vines ensnaring Fuentes, causing him to fall backward. SCP-6047-1 roars again and coils its severed vines into a conical shape before extending a 3-meter-long blade resembling a leaf of a Yucca thompsoniana. It takes several swings at Elkhart with this blade, but he manages to deflect them with his machete._

  * _Juno finally manages to exit the overturned SUV with the mother and child, escorting them away from the conflict while Elkhart distracts the entity._

  * _SCP-6047-1's movement is significantly more jerky and erratic compared to its initial emergence, its smaller SCP-6047 tendrils lashing about wildly. The entity's strikes quickly increase in intensity with each deflection, until the sheer force of its impacts are enough to knock Elkhart's machete from his hand, causing him to stagger backward. Before Elkhart can regain his footing, SCP-6047-1 swings with its leaf blade and severs his right forearm completely. Elkhart immediately cries out in pain and falls to his knees as Aguilar moves to cover him._

  * **Aguilar:** Control! Requesting medical EVAC, Elkhart is severely wounded! Unable to offer medical assistance at this time, too busy trying to keep this thing off our asses!

  * _Simon staggers out of the broken window of the storefront clutching her arm, which appears to be broken. The unidentified male is not present, presumably having been killed in the impact._

  * _By now, SCP-6047-1's movements have now become almost feral, the entity's body twitching and shuddering as it advances on the team, its bladed appendage beginning to shift back into a hand._

  * _Aguilar is forced to leap off the SUV as SCP-6047-1 slams its hands down on the vehicle where she previously stood, leaving a substantial dent in the frame. As she reorients herself, SCP-6047-1 can be seen slamming its fists onto the vehicle over and over again as it emits deep, rumbling vocalizations reminiscent of an agitated gorilla. Despite the volume of these vocalizations, it cannot be seen where they emanate from on its body. After 45 seconds of this, the entity's strikes slow, its body language indicating its agitation is gradually fading. By now the SUV is almost bent completely in half from the force of the entity's strikes._

  * **Aguilar:** Heyâ€¦ we don't want to hurt you. Please let us go.

  * _SCP-6047-1 appears to enter a relaxed state as it turns to face Aguilar. Notably, the brown wilted patches on its skin have disappeared completely, and the gunshot wounds and fire damage are also no longer present. The entity begins making a series of complex hand gestures at Aguilar for approximately 13 seconds before its body unwinds into vines and disappears into the underbrush._

**< End Log:>**

Elkhart, Simon, and Fuentes were given medical treatment for their injuries. The mother and child were questioned about their experiences within the anomaly before being administered amnestics and released. Apparently, they had subsisted primarily off of fruit for the duration of their captivity in the vines; the fruits always grew close enough for them to reach and would regenerate immediately after being picked, indicating the anomaly might have intended to feed them. The man that had attacked SCP-6047-1 was, per the woman's testimony, the owner of the storefront, but she could give no further details. The man was found deceased within the store, buried beneath a toppled shelf. The exact chemical within the canister the man used against SCP-6047-1 could not be identified, as its contents were empty upon discovery. Upon thorough analysis of the recording, Aguilar noted she recognized the hand gestures made by SCP-6047-1 as being a form of sign language, specifically CRSL.[2](javascript:;) Aguilar, being a local with a deaf younger sister, knew the language intimately. A translation of SCP-6047-1's statements is as follows:
"No fight. No fight. Bad water. Dark water."
Following these developments, Agent Yvelis Aguilar was placed in charge of the second exploration team, with the new objective being to establish further communication with SCP-6047-1 and determine the nature of its predicament.
**Participating Agents:** _Yvelis Aguilar_ (Team Lead), _Evan Carter_ (Second Lead), _Ming Xialan_ (Incendiary), _Lyn Juno_ (Incendiary), _Eloise Simon_ (Navigation - Simon was deemed essential despite her broken arm)  
**Location:** Zone-SCP-6047  
**Date:** 9/11/2022
* * *
**< Begin Log:>**
  * _Team enters SCP-6047 from previous entry point. Vegetation has almost completely regrown since Expedition 1, slowing progress significantly._

  * **Aguilar:** Alright everyone, look alive. Machetes out.

  * **Simon:** It's strange how quickly this plant life can regrow. Where's it getting its nutrients from?

  * **Juno:** I think you're overestimating how much these anomalies play by the "rules". Hey Aguilar, you seriously planning on talking with the plant monster?

  * **Aguilar:** That's the whole point of us being here, Juno, so yes. Also, I can't help feeling we're jumping the gun by calling it a monster.

  * **Juno:** It fucking cut off Elkhart's arm, and it broke Simon's. I'll call it what I please.

  * **Aguilar:** It only attacked us after that man sprayed it with theâ€¦ did they ever figure out what was in that spray can? Anyways, prior to that, it showed no signs of hostility.

  * **Juno:** Iâ€¦ guess I'd be pretty pissed too if someone sprayed acid in my face. The thing seemed to go completely nuts the moment that stuff touched it.

  * **Aguilar:** I think we should add "identify the chemical that's been enraging SCP-6047-1" to our list of objectives.

  * _After 30 minutes, team has managed to reach the overturned SUV, which is now completely overcome with vines._

  * **Aguilar:** Alright, hold for a moment. I got a hunchâ€¦

  * _Aguilar enters the broken storefront alongside Simon while the others take defensive positions near the SUV. The interior of the store is ransacked, both from the previous attack and from apparent looting activity. Most of the shelves are bare and partially obscured by SCP-6047 vegetation._

  * _Aguilar and Simon make their way to the back of the store. The door to the manager's office is covered in vines bearing red fruits similar to the one that had ensnared Fuentes. Turning to her right, Aguilar instead uses her rifle to break the doorknob on the supply closet before pulling the door open._

  * **Aguilar:** Mops, floor cleaner, bleach, Windexâ€¦ wait a minuteâ€¦

  * _On one of the top shelves of the closet is a silver spray canister with no discernable label. Canister appears reminiscent of a can of spray paint or some varieties of bug spray. Aguilar takes the can and slots it in a holster on Simon's vest._

  * **Simon:** Wait, why are you giving it to me?

  * **Aguilar:** So you can get the hell out of here before-

  * _Faint shouting outside can be heard, prompting Aguilar and Simon to immediately head back outside. On the opposite end of the street, Juno is struggling within a dense patch of SCP-6047 foliage. Even from a distance the crimson color of the extending thorns can be distinguished, slowly radiating out from her position._

  * **Aguilar:** What happened to "stay put?"

  * **Juno:** Fuckin hell, I swear I saw some kid run by with one of those silver spray cans. I thought you needed one.

  * **Aguilar:** We did, we found one in the shop. This does indicate some people are still alive in here, though, and possibly using those spray cans to defend themselves. But, somethingâ€¦ something's not adding up here. We gotta get to the source of this, stat.

  * _The next 10 minutes are spent freeing Juno from the thorny vines before the team sets off again, making their way further down the street. After another 15 minutes, the foliage begins to gradually shift from overgrown SCP-6047 vines to plantlife of varying species, nearly all of which appear to be native to Costa Rica._

  * **Aguilar:** The plant life is growing more complex now. It's diverging in species.

  * **Juno:** Any theories, miss botanist?

  * **Aguilar:** Perhaps the fast-spreading vines are like an early growth stage, and once they take hold on an area, they serve as a foundation for other plants to grow? It still looks like they're all connected to the same vines, regardless of species.

  * **Simon:** If the plants are gradually growing more complex as we go, that would suggest they're radiating out from a central point. We're definitely getting close.

  * **Carter:** What should we do if we run into more people with spray cans?

  * **Aguilar:** I think we have to leave them be. We don't have enough manpower for an extraction.

  * **Juno:** Second that plan. No way we can evac them through this underbrush with how fast it regrows behind us. Speaking of, maybe we should turn back. Get a chemical analysis on that can-

  * _A loud roar up ahead causes the team to stop short. 30m ahead, movement can be faintly distinguished through the thick underbrush. The team goes silent as they start advancing slowly towards the source of the commotion._

  * **Carter:** SHIT- FAN OUT, FAN OUT!

  * _A dark silhouette looms above as a heavily damaged pickup truck hurtles through the air towards the team. Everyone leaps for cover in random directions as the vehicle smashes through the thick vegetation and collides with the ground. The driver of the truck is still in the front seat, having been presumably killed on impact._

  * **Aguilar:** Is everyone alright?

  * **Simon:** Well, my arm can't get any more broken- AGUILAR BEHIND YOU!

  * _Aguilar quickly turns to see the fist of SCP-6047-1 bursting through the foliage, impacting her in the torso and sending her flying through the open doors of the pickup and out the other side. Her helmet is knocked loose from the impact, and it takes her several seconds to regain her footing._

  * **Carter:** HEY UGLY, OVER HERE!

  * _Carter fires his assault rifle into the back of SCP-6047-1 to draw its attention away from Aguilar. The entity's body is covered in several brown, wilted patches and its movement is exceedingly erratic. As the team distracts SCP-6047-1, multiple individuals emerge from the overgrowth, running in random directions._

  * _SCP-6047-1 turns its attention away from the team as one of the fleeing townsfolk triggers a thorn trap, the thorns radiating outwards far faster than previously recorded, encompassing the team and the bystanders in under 10 seconds._

  * **Aguilar:** Fucking hellâ€¦ glad these suits actually workâ€¦

  * _As the bystanders attempt to traverse through the thorns of the overgrowth, SCP-6047-1 ceases its advance and holds out its hand. Multiple greenish bulbs form from the entity's hand, eventually taking on the forms of green apple-like fruits. SCP-6047-1 rears back in a pose resembling a baseball pitcher before lobbing the entire volley of fruits with considerable speed directly at the team and bystanders. One of the fruits hits Aguilar in the face before she can react. The fruits hit with enough force to shatter on impact, releasing milky white pulp that burns on contact, causing Aguilar to clutch her face._

  * **Aguilar:** FFFAAAAAAAAGH, IT'S MANCHINEEL! SECURE YOUR HELMETS!

  * _As Aguilar struggles to clear her vision, SCP-6047-1 can be seen rapidly approaching the bystanders, who appear to be severely burned by the toxic fruits. Before the entity can close the distance, Xialan leaps up from the underbrush and aims her flamethrower directly at its flower-face, causing it to stagger backward. Xialan keeps her fire directed at SCP-6047-1 until she completely runs out of fuel, leaving the entity severely burned and charred. SCP-6047-1 stumbles for several seconds before its body begins unwinding into vines and disappears into the foliage._

**< End Log:>**
* * *
Trapped bystanders were evacuated via helicopter from within SCP-6047 and treated for severe burns and Manchineel poisoning. All individuals questioned testified they had used a "special spray" to fend off the anomalous plant life, but none were able to produce any samples of the chemical, as they had dropped their canisters in their attempts to flee. The canister Simon had was lost as she dove to avoid the falling pickup truck, and could not be located. Foundation medical personnel treated Aguilar's wounds on-site, which mostly consisted of various bruises and severe burns on the left side of her face. Despite vision in her left eye being heavily reduced due to the poison exposure, she vehemently insisted the team camp on-site overnight before trekking further into the anomaly the next morning. The team proceeded to set up their tents around the destroyed pickup truck before falling asleep. By the next morning, the tents were completely covered in SCP-6047 foliage, to the point where they had to be abandoned in the interest of time.

**< Begin Log:>**
  * **Aguilar:** Cams on, mics on, we are go. Let's move.

  * _Aguilar immediately sets off down the road, hacking through the dense vegetation._

  * **Xialan:** Aguilar, what about your helmet? The CBRNA suits don't really work if you don't have them sealed.

  * **Aguilar:** I lost it. I searched everywhere this morning, but the foliage is too dense. No worries, though, this might help me interact with it more peacefully. I have a plan.

  * **Xialan:** and it involves the entity being able to see your pretty little face?

  * **Aguilar:** Every time it gets near any of the townspeople, it goes berserk. We have to catch it while it's in its docile state in order for us to speak with it. I need to make sure it can fully see what I'm saying.

  * **Carter:** Aiight, but how do we get its attention without pissing it off?

  * **Aguilar:** We already have its attention. We always did. I thinkâ€¦ I think it can feel through every single plant we touch. The SCP-6047, it's all linked together. That's how the thorn traps work. All this foliageâ€¦ it's like neural fibers. We're walking in one big brain!

  * **Carter:** That doesn't quite answer my question, though. How do we make it actually show itself?

  * **Aguilar:** Simple, we ring the dinner-bell. Any of those red trap fruits you see, smash them. Use a big stick if you can find one. Hey, Simon, how close are we to the epicenter?

  * **Simon:** Definitely within a few blocks. I'm seeing some heavy obstructions up ahead, though, so we might need to cut through a store.

  * **Xialan:** Obstructions? The kind we can burn through?

  * **Simon:** The kind that transports hundreds of gallons of gasoline. It's a fuel truck, and it's blocking the whole damn intersection. Look ahead, not at the sky.

  * **Xialan:** I'm not looking at the sky, I'm looking at the people in the windows watching us.

  * **Aguilar:** Keep moving, we need to put as much distance between them and us as possible. We don't want them getting in the way. Simon, lead on.

  * _Team makes steady progress towards the intersection, where a large fuel tanker and several cars have formed a massive pile-up. Team turns right and follows the next street, setting off multiple red thorn fruits with a crooked golf club Carter found._

  * _Approximately 60 seconds after the third fruit is triggered, the foliage around the team begins rustling on all sides. SCP-6047-1 manifests 10 meters left of the team and begins approaching at a casual pace. All damage sustained by Xialan's flamethrower the previous day seems to be completely repaired._

  * **Aguilar:** Hold your fire everyone. Let me try talking first. Try to keep anyone from running up and spraying it.

  * _Aguilar stows her assault rifle and approaches the entity, holding up her hands in a show of surrender. Approximately 5 meters from Aguilar's position, SCP-6047-1 ceases its approach and focuses on her._

**[Note: Dialogue in {} was translated from Costa Rican Sign Language]**
  * **Aguilar:** {Hello, we mean you no harm.}

  * _SCP-6047-1 pauses for a moment before raising its hands and responding._

  * **SCP-6047-1:** {Hello, we mean you no harm.}

  * **Aguilar:** {Then why do you attack these people?}

  * **SCP-6047-1:** {Do not want. No harm. Bad water burns. Come with me.}

  * _SCP-6047-1 turns and begins walking in the opposite direction of the team, heading towards an alleyway._

  * **Juno:** Boss, what did it say?

  * **Aguilar:** It doesn't want to harm anyone, the "bad water" hurts it. It wants us to follow.

  * **Juno:** Three guesses what the "bad water" is. Alright, lead the way.

  * _Team begins following SCP-6047-1 down a series of winding alleyways. The further the team progresses, the denser and more diverse the surrounding vegetation becomes until at least 20 different species of tropical plants can be identified among the amalgamated vines. After 3 minutes the team emerges into a large clearing with a significantly lower density of SCP-6047 vegetation. The clearing is situated on a two-lane street, with tire marks on the road suggesting any vehicles abandoned within had been dragged away to free up the space. Vegetation within the clearing has reached a point of diversity and complexity to where fully-grown trees are dotting the perimeter of the clearing at random intervals. Directly across from the alleyway entrance appears to be a heavily dilapidated automotive repair shop almost completely covered in SCP-6047 vegetation._

  * **Aguilar:** This place isâ€¦ beautifulâ€¦ did you make this?

  * _SCP-6047-1 briefly stops and turns to face Aguilar._

  * **SCP-6047-1:** {She enjoys them.}

  * _SCP-6047-1 continues walking in the direction of the auto shop._

  * **Juno:** Well, now we know it can _hear_ , but if that's the case, why sign language?

  * **Xialan:** I'm pretty sure it lacks a mouth. Its face is just a flower.

  * **Juno:** Didn't we hear it roaring before?

  * _Within the auto shop, most of the equipment, parked vehicles, tool racks, and other paraphernalia are heavily obscured by SCP-6047 foliage. While most of the plants can be identified as various tropical species, periodically there are patches of denser growth sprouting multiple large leaves, up to one meter in width. Small bioluminescent fruits emitting yellow light are hanging from the ceiling, providing moderate illumination. A 5-meter-wide hole is visible in the ceiling, forming a sort of crude skylight. Gouge marks around the edges of the hole suggest it was created by SCP-6047-1's claws._

  * _SCP-6047-1 turns to face team again._

  * **SCP-6047-1:** {Need help. Must help. Must protect.}

  * **Aguilar:** {Protect what? From who?}

  * _A metallic scraping sound can be heard from above. Before the team can react, a large silver barrel falls through the hole and lands directly on SCP-6047-1, its metal surface rupturing on impact and dousing the entity in an unidentified colorless chemical. Faint shouting and cheering can be heard from above, presumably by the culprits._

  * **Aguilar:** Hijo de puta, a fucking ambush. RUN!

  * _SCP-6047-1 roars loud enough to shake the ground as its body becomes heavily wilted and scarred, its skin starting to ripple before tendrils burst out in all directions. The tendrils strike with sufficient force to completely bisect wooden shelves and damage the metal supports of the car lifts. Aguilar ducks under a lashing vine before turning around and rapidly advancing towards the entrance._

  * _Carter, Xialan, Simon, and Juno exit through the shop's open garage and begin traversing across the clearing. Faint screams can be heard behind Aguilar as SCP-6047-1 engages its attackers. A headless body of a man impacts a pillar on Aguilar's left, followed by a head smashing into the wall towards her right. Aguilar finally exits the garage as the roaring of the entity grows louder. Aguilar makes it about 10 meters before her movement abruptly ceases as she turns to see a vine coiling around her right leg. Two seconds later the vine goes taut, yanking her onto her back before rapidly pulling her back towards the auto shop._

  * **Aguilar:** Agh! Fuck! Fuckfuckfuck!

  * _After about 9 seconds Aguilar manages to un-latch her machete from its sheath before leaning down and slicing through the vine around her leg. SCP-6047-1 roars again as it slowly stalks forwards, its hands now stained with blood. A few of the surviving assailants are slowly backing away, clutching smaller spray cans in the hopes of deterring the entity._

  * **Juno:** Boss!

  * **Aguilar:** Don't come in! Get these people out of here, let me deal with the entity.

  * **Juno:** The fuck- what are you gonna do?!

  * **Aguilar:** Something incredibly stupid. I'm gonna tire it out.

  * **Juno:** YOU'RE GONNA WHA-

  * _Aguilar runs directly at SCP-6047-1 in an effort to draw its attention, sliding between its legs as it attempts to swipe at her before running behind a pillar to avoid another strike. SCP-6047-1 slams its fist directly through the pillar just above Aguilar's head, prompting her to dive and roll. Aguilar sidesteps two more striking vines before leaping over a shelf. SCP-6047-1 smashes directly through the shelf with a shoulder bash, nearly knocking Aguilar off-balance. Vines lash out in all directions, forcing Aguilar to deflect multiple blows with her machete before she turns to run again. One lashing vine strikes Aguilar in her shoulder, managing to cut through multiple layers of her CBRNA suit but not causing significant injury. For the next two minutes Aguilar maneuvers about the auto shop, barely evading SCP-6047-1's strikes but steadily slowing down due to the exertion of her efforts. In an attempt to back away from the entity, Aguilar slips on a discarded soda can, causing her to stumble just long enough for it to slam its fist into her midsection._

  * **Aguilar:** AUGH!

  * _Aguilar is sent flying backward before impacting the far wall at the rear of the building, landing in a pile of large leaves. By the time she manages to rise to her feet again, SCP-6047-1 is standing directly over her, its fist raised and prepared to strike down._

  * **Aguilar:** Whâ€¦ wait- NO!

  * _Aguilar takes a wide stance and holds up her machete in a blocking position as SCP-6047-1 brings its fist down. Just before it impacts, the entity ceases all movement, its stance abruptly relaxing. Over the course of the encounter SCP-6047-1's body had regained its healthy green hue, and its aggressive vocalizations have now ceased. Slowly the entity lowers its fist and takes several steps back before falling to one knee, staring up at Aguilar. Aguilar finally rises fully to her feet and sheathes her machete before looking down at the mass between her and SCP-6047-1._

  * **Aguilar:** Is thisâ€¦ the one you're protecting?

  * _Laying in a nest of large SCP-6047 leaves is a small humanoid entity that appears to be comprised entirely of plant matter, similar to SCP-6047-1. This entity (henceforth designated SCP-6047-2) has the general appearance of an adolescent humanoid female with pale skin that transitions into a mix of indigo and navy blue around the forearms, lower legs, and upper back. SCP-6047-2, unlike 6047-1, has a vaguely humanoid face, with two large yellow eyes, slit nostrils, and a mouth filled with teeth resembling rose thorns. Atop the entity's head is a "hat-like" upturned flower, its elongated navy-blue pedals drooping down in a manner similar to hair. SCP-6047-2 is curled up in a mostly fetal position and appears to be unconscious, and various large patches of its skin are wilted to the point of turning completely black. Aguilar lowers herself to one knee before SCP-6047-2 and looks back up at SCP-6047-1._

  * **Aguilar:** {Whoâ€¦ is she? Is she the one you're trying to keep safe?}

  * **SCP-6047-1:** {She is friend. Sick. Bad water. Too much.}

  * **Aguilar:** {What is the bad water?}

  * _SCP-6047-1 unwinds its right arm and stretches out its vines, coiling them around a discarded silver canister before pulling it close and handing it to Aguilar._

  * **SCP-6047-1:** {Bad water.}

  * **Aguilar:** {Why are the people attacking you with this? What are you? How did all this happen?}

  * **SCP-6047-1:** {We protect big garden. Garden city. Gardeners take care of garden. We watch unseen. We keep gardeners safe.}

  * **Aguilar:** {You've been watching over these peopleâ€¦ for how long?}

  * **SCP-6047-1:** {Long time. Long time.}

  * **Aguilar:** {Do the people know about you? Or did they?}

  * **SCP-6047-1:** {Gardeners never know. Until gardeners saw. Gardeners afraid. Gardeners panic.}

  * **Aguilar:** {What did they do when they panicked?}

  * **SCP-6047-1:** {Gardeners buy weapons and chase us. Weapons not work. Weapons not hurt. Gardeners more scared. Gardeners discover bad water. Bad water burns.}

  * **Aguilar:** {Is that what's wrong with her?}

  * **SCP-6047-1:** {Bad water makes her sick. Must protect her. Must keep bad water away. Gardeners afraid. Gardeners keep using bad water. Bad water makes us hurt them. Don't want to hurt them. Don't want. Don't want.}

  * **Aguilar:** {Hey, hey, calm down. It's okay now, I promise. I promise you I will do whatever I can to help her, okay? Please let me talk to my team.}

  * **SCP-6047-1:** {Okay. Okay. Talk with team.}

  * _Aguilar leaves the building and walks outside to brief her team. Five minutes later all agents return inside, having confiscated any remaining canisters held by the townsfolk._

  * **Aguilar:** Hello, I'm back. I told them everything you told me. We wish to help you, okay?

  * **SCP-6047-1:** {Yes. Help. Please. Protect her.}

  * **Juno:** You weren't kiddingâ€¦ she- it looksâ€¦ almost humanâ€¦ kinda.

  * **Xialan:** Fascinatingâ€¦

  * **Carter:** Plant or not, that one looks sick even from here.

  * _Aguilar kneels down and slowly places a hand on the forehead of SCP-6047-2, causing the entity to whimper slightly and shift its position, but not wake up._

  * **Aguilar:** Damnâ€¦ she's burning up. Feels just like a fever. Hey, how can we cure her?

  * **SCP-6047-1:** {Don't know. Tried. Food not work. Air not work. Water not work. Nothing work. Must protect her.}

  * **Aguilar:** These black patchesâ€¦ they're all trailing out from a central point in the abdominal region. Massive black spot here. SCP-6047-1 has been able to purge the toxins from its system extremely fast, even if they do cause it to go berserk. There's gotta be a reason why SCP-6047-2 can't flush its system.

  * **Juno:** Fuck, maybe she ate a whole can?

  * **Aguilar:** Thatâ€¦ could be it!

  * **Aguilar:** {To remove the can, we may have to cut her open. Do we have your permission to try?}

  * _30 seconds pass before SCP-6047-1 responds._

  * **SCP-6047-1:** {Do it. Help her. Will hold her.}

  * _SCP-6047-1 uses its vines to readjust SCP-6047-2's position, resting the entity on its back before restraining its limbs. SCP-6047-2 shifts slightly, but still does not regain consciousness. Aguilar gets in position and orients her machete upside down, lining the edge with SCP-6047-2's abdomen._

  * **Aguilar:** Wellâ€¦ here goes nothingâ€¦

  * _Aguilar presses more firmly on the blade until it begins piercing into SCP-6047-2's flesh. SCP-6047-2 struggles slightly and makes a whimpering noise, but does not offer significant resistance. Slowly Aguilar begins cutting upwards, pressing the blade further into SCP-6047-2's abdomen, creating a large gash similar to those made during autopsies. After 65 seconds Aguilar's blade makes contact with a metallic object, prompting her to stop. Xialan widens both halves with her fingers so Aguilar can reach inside. After several seconds Aguilar slowly pulls her hand free, clutching a partially crushed unmarked canister and a partially decayed human finger._

  * **Juno:** What the fuck-

  * **Carter:** Cool it, Juno, you've seen worse.

  * _Aguilar carefully sets both items aside as the gash in SCP-6047-2's abdomen begins gradually closing, soon healing completely and leaving no visible traces._

  * **Aguilar:** Okay, give her some water. That should kickstart her system.

  * _Carter helps prop up SCP-6047-2's upper body as Xialan allows the entity to drink from her canteen. Over the next several minutes the large black patches on SCP-6047-2's body gradually fade and return to their normal colors. SCP-6047-2 still does not regain full consciousness, so Carter helps lay it back down so it can better recover._

  * _SCP-6047-1 stares at Aguilar, its lack of facial features making its demeanor unclear._

  * **Aguilar:** So, I'm guessing that canister got stuck in her vines while her body was in the process of reforming itself, and because the can got partially crushed, it was gradually leaking poison into her body. Must've made her too weak to unweave herself again, poor thing. It definitely seems like she's going to recover now, though.

  * **SCP-6047-1:** {â€¦ Thank you. Thank you. Good gardener. Good help. Saved her.}

  * **Aguilar:** {Heyâ€¦ why are you able to speak sign language?}

  * **SCP-6047-1:** {â€¦ She cannot hear. I cannot speak. She taught me.}

  * **Aguilar:** {She'sâ€¦ deaf? My sister is deaf. What is this one to you?}

  * **SCP-6047-1:** {She isâ€¦ friend. Good gardener. Loves flowers. Loves Rosa kordesii.}

  * **Aguilar:** {Does she have a name? Do you?}

  * **SCP-6047-1:** {Cannotâ€¦ sign names. Not right words. Cannot speak. We protect gardeners. We keep gardeners safe. Make garden bloom.}

  * _Approximately 30 minutes later, SCP-6047-2 begins to regain consciousness, sitting up within the nest of leaves and examining the team with apparent curiosity. SCP-6047-2 and SCP-6047-1 converse in CRSL for several minutes before SCP-6047-2 raises itself into a kneeling position facing Aguilar. SCP-6047-2 holds out its arms wide for a few seconds, and when Aguilar does not move, the entity lunges forward and wraps its arms around her, trapping her in a tight hug. Aguilar remains still for several seconds before cautiously reciprocating the gesture._

  * **Aguilar:** I know you can't hear me, but i-it's okayâ€¦ you'reâ€¦ you're safe nowâ€¦

  * **Juno:** Heh, once they go green they can never goâ€¦ fuckâ€¦ I'll think of a better joke.

  * _It takes nearly 5 minutes for the team to pry Aguilar free of SCP-6047-2's grip. As Aguilar rises to her feet, muffled shouting and knocking can be heard emanating from a hallway in the back-right of the shop._

  * **Juno:** I really fucking hope that's not more people with torches and pitchforks, we _literally just_ resolved this shit peacefully for once.

  * **Aguilar:** Carter, Xialan, behind me. Juno, Simon, keep an eye on our new "friends". If it's armed bystanders, use your mace. They're not hostile, they're just scared.

  * _Aguilar slowly advances down the heavily overgrown hallway with her machete and mace in hand. To her left is a single door that has been completely overgrown with vegetation to the point of being sealed shut, with multiple red fruits spanning its surface. Aguilar carefully uses her machete to sever the fruits from the vines without damaging them before setting them in a corner._

  * **Aguilar:** Damn, the hinges are clogged with vegetation, and the knob's gone. Carter, Xialan, burn it open. Use short bursts, we don't wanna burn the whole building down.

  * _Aguilar steps back as Carter and Xialan get into position, aiming their flamethrowers at the doorframe. Carter and Xialan fire short bursts of flame at the vegetation, causing it to burn rapidly until it's completely incinerated. Once the door has sufficiently cooled, Aguilar bashes the door open with her shoulder._

  * _Within the rear supply room, the five missing agents are sitting in the far corner, partially covered in vegetation but appearing otherwise alive and conscious._

  * **Aguilar:** Max, Luz, Grayson, Lauren, Fawkes, yeah that's everyone. Hey, you guys alright?

  * **Grayson:** Hoooooly fuck am I glad to see you, Yve- oh fuck, what happened to your face?

  * **Aguilar:** Oh, only the most poisonous fruit in the natural world. Does it look bad?

  * **Fawkes:** No worse than usual! Maybe we should start calling you Two-Face!

  * **Carter:** Glad to see you idiots are still okay enough to talk shit. What have you guys been eating?

  * **Luz:** Nothing but fruit. It grows back almost as soon as you pick it butâ€¦ soâ€¦ muchâ€¦ fruit. I think I've developed anti-scurvy.

  * **Grayson:** That thing seemed pretty hostile at first, but at some point, it just calmed down and started carrying us around. Dragged us here and threw us in this back room. It seemed reeeeally insistent on taking our dispersal units, though.

  * **Aguilar:** Yeah, we had a talk about that. Apparently, those chemical sprays make it go berserk.

  * **Fawkes:** Wait, you had a talk with it? It ain't got no mouth.

  * **Aguilar:** What can I say, I'm a people-person. Come on, I'll introduce you.

**< End Log:>**
* * *
After the events of SCP-6047 Exploration Log: 3, the overgrown vegetation of SCP-6047 was quickly removed from San Jose with the aid of SCP-6047-1 and SCP-6047-2. Through the use of industrial-sized motorized mulchers and woodchippers, the amalgamated SCP-6047 vegetation was gradually converted into compost and mulch before being reintroduced into the local jungle.
As a result of the expeditions, agents Yvelis Aguilar, Evan Carter, Ming Xialan, and Lyn Juno were recommended for entry into MTF Theta-4 "Gardeners". Most of the poison damage to Aguilar's face healed within weeks of the incident, but eyesight in her left eye is still partially reduced and her skin is lightly scarred. Aguilar reportedly feels no resentment over the injury.
After the successful retrieval of multiple canisters used by the people of San Jose, chemical analysis revealed their contents to be composed of _"2,4-D,"_ _"2,4,5-T,"_ and TCDD, a mixture almost chemically identical to Agent Orange. Faint traces of an additional anomalous substance were also detected, an unknown chemical that creates a caustic chemical reaction whenever exposed to the cell walls of organic plant life. It is theorized this anomalous chemical is what gave the "Bad Water" its unusually fast-acting properties. Henceforth, this chemical composition will be referred to as HMC[3](javascript:;)-245 "Agent Silver". Testimonies from individuals in possession of HMC-245 claim they all bought the chemical from an as-yet unidentified street vendor after first encountering SCP-6047-1. The vendor reportedly claimed HMC-245 could protect them from "attacks" by SCP-6047-1, but evidence from Agent Aguilar's recordings indicates the chemical almost invariably instigates an aggressive reaction in the entity, suggesting this may have been a deliberate ploy by the vendor. An investigation into the identity of the street vendor (henceforth referred to as POI-6047) and the circumstances of the initial encounter with SCP-6047-1 is still underway.
**Addendum 6047-3, Revised SCP-6047 Containment Procedures**  
Following the events of SCP-6047 Exploration Log: 3 and the dismantling of Zone-SCP-6047, the following revisions to SCP-6047's containment procedures have been made:
[\+ Show Revised Containment Procedures](javascript:;)
[\- Close](javascript:;)
**Item #:** SCP-6047
**Object Class:** Euclid
**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-6047-1 and SCP-6047-2 are kept within a 4-square-acre climate-controlled enclosure within Botanical Containment Site-317 in the Costa Rican jungle. Entrances into the enclosure are sealed with reinforced steel vault doors. The upper half of the enclosure consists of a massive dome of multi-layer ballistics glass lined with over 60 security cameras and backup lighting equipment. The outer shutters of the enclosure can close to block out all light in the event of a containment breach or air traffic over the facility. No pesticides, herbicides, or defoliants of any variety may be introduced into the SCP-6047 enclosure without explicit approval of Site Supervisors. Enclosure irrigation systems must be checked bi-monthly to ensure proper hydration of occupants and vegetation. Seedlings of native Costa Rican vegetation were introduced into the enclosure during its construction, and due to the anomalous properties of the SCP-6047 entities, these plants have rapidly grown to maturity, creating a dense jungle-like environment. SCP-6047-1 and SCP-6047-2 have each been implanted with 12 GPS tracking chips in various regions of their bodies to record their positions even when their bodies have disassembled. Both entities are to undergo monthly medical checkups with Foundation botanists to test for any lingering effects of HMC-245 "Agent Silver" exposure. At least one Foundation personnel proficient in Costa Rican Sign Language must be present during medical examinations and during their enclosure's opening hours.
Due to the even temperament of SCP-6047-1 and SCP-6047-2 and the "beautiful" conditions of their enclosure, Site-317 Supervisors have authorized the enclosure's usage as a recreational area for Site personnel. Personnel may eat their lunches within the enclosure, provided they clean up all trash and debris prior to their exit. A petition to host meditation classes and other activities within the SCP-6047 enclosure is currently under review. Efforts are currently underway to teach SCP-6047-1 and SCP-6047-2 ASL[4](javascript:;) so they can better communicate with site personnel. They have also been provided waterproof tablets with text-to-speech programs to streamline the process further.
Since being brought into containment, SCP-6047-2 has made the following requests:
  * To be referred to as "Myrabis" in conversation [Accepted]
  * For SCP-6047-1 to be referred to as "Kordess" in conversation [Accepted]
  * A laptop computer with "the internets Yvelis talked about" [Denied]
  * One live Ocelot[5](javascript:;) "as a pet" [Denied]
  * One waterproof and stainproof plushie of an Ocelot [Pending acquisition]
  * The ability to periodically interact with Agent Yvelis Aguilar [Accepted when MTF Theta-4 is not engaged in anomaly containment duties]
