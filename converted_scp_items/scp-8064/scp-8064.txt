Description:

 SCP-8064 is a sapient humanoid, also known as [REDACTED]. While its Hume field fluctuates in the bounds of 16.97 ± 0.83, SCP-8064 is biologically identical to a human. It has remained in a comatose state since 20/01/2017.

The health conditions of SCP-8064 correlate with natural and man-made disasters. Statistical analysis is unable to infer with confidence whether these correlations are aligned with the wellbeing of Earth's overarching biosphere, or aligned strictly with the wellbeing of humanity.

SCP-8064 is otherwise a conceptually stable entity. Most

Hi Director Moose,

As requested, please see the attached consent forms. Ten anomalies have expressed willingness to have their anomalous properties neutralised. I've scheduled an Ethics Committee liaison to hold interviews with them next week, though these are mostly a formality and we can expect them to proceed without issue.

For your convenience, I've also included a copy of my revised proposal for the DHAR. I'll be ready to brief the other deparment directors in our upcoming meeting. Let me know your thoughts.

Secure, Contain, Protect

- Dir. K. Mitchell

Department of Humanoid Anomaly Reversion

Abstract

Since its inception, the Foundation has observed an exponential increase in the number of humanoid anomalies, in line with population growth of baseline humanity. Financial and sociopolitical backing from public and private institutions is barely keeping pace with the growing demand of containment. It is clear that the current approach is not sustainable.

Every new anomaly adds to the complexity of the Foundation's containment ecosystem. Due to our limited scientific understanding, resources allocated to each anomaly are justified on an almost qualitative basis i.e. how well the research lead can argue their case, rather than the objective threat posed to humanity at large. Our dependence on the support from 

external

 

parties

 further complicates our priorities, as they may lobby for the containment of certain anomalies to forward their interests. The result is the Foundation today, where each dollar spent is scrutinised by anyone who thinks it might hurt their own pockets.

We propose a radical solution to alleviate this problem - the formation of the Department of Humanoid Anomaly Reversion (DHAR). 63% of known humanoid anomalies were once everyday people that drew the short end of the stick. The Foundation spends in excess of $150 billion a year to maintain their containment. DHAR seeks to neuter their anomalous properties and rehabilitate them as employees of the Foundation, and potentially as productive members of the wider society. We already have the 

Integration Program

. Let's take it a step further.

Mitchell:

 …so we project a successful implementation to cut down the site's operating costs by up to 24% per annum. Thank you for listening.

Mild applause.

Mitchell:

 Any questions?

Silence.

Moose:

 Alright, let's hand over to our next speaker, Director Shorten-

Shorten:

 

Cough.

 Excuse me Director Mitchell. We've only neutralised anomalies on a case-by-case basis so far. A general, blanket strategy is unheard of. I'm curious to hear how you got sign-off on this.

Lorraine:

 I'm afraid this might not be entirely aligned with our modus operandi, to secure and contain.

Mitchell:

 Thank you, Shorten, Lorraine, for your concern. Rest assured, I've moved through the appropriate channels for approvals. Besides, we all have doctorates here. Disrupting the standard should come naturally to us.

Singer:

 Piggybacking on Shorten's question, each humanoid's properties are unique and varied. It's surprising to hear there exists a universal neutralisation mechanism.

Mitchell:

 Thank you Singer. We have a proof of concept in development. We'll be ready to present it once we've ascertained its reliability.

Shorten:

 Would you mind explaining how the PoC would work? I think I speak for everyone when I say that we're all very interested.

Mitchell:

 Unfortunately, properly covering the finer details would take some time, and this meeting is already behind schedule.

Moose:

 Director Shorten, if you would.

Shorten:

 …of course, Director Moose.

Shorten moves towards the podium.

Mitchell:

 I'll be happy to circle back to this and elaborate some other time.

Proof of Concept v0.12

Methodology:

 The DHARPE (DHAR Prototype Engine) is composed of a matrix of 168 toggleable SRA's (Scranton Reality Anchor) and 356 Hume counters uniformly surrounding an ellipsoidal 2m x 0.5m x 0.5m copper-lined chamber. The output signals from the Hume counters are fed to 54 Foundation Grade V TPUs (Tensor Processing Unit), which are software-calibrated to predict the minute variations of the Hume fields present in the chamber. The predictions are used toggle the SRA's, counteracting the variations as they manifest.

Avenlee paces around the corner of the lab, muttering to himself.

Avenlee:

 If I use SRA's…no…grind to…reset.

Avenlee:

Mitchell and Riley enter.

Mitchell:

 And this'll be your primary work site. State-of-the-art biosensors, artificial intelligence servers, you name it.

Riley:

 What about mentorship? Do I get someone to show me the ropes?

Mitchell:

 Oh yes, you'll get a dedicated mentor.

Chck tchk kchk.

Riley:

 Nice, I think I've got the gist of things. I must say, I didn't expect a private tour from the department head.

Mitchell:

 Ahh, err…that's because you're um, talented and-

Riley:

 Don't tell me I'm the only applicant.

Mitchell:

 Okay, there was a resource procurement issue. Nothing for you to worry about.

Chck kchk.

Avenlee:

 Conditional…paradox…

Riley:

 What's up with him?

Mitchell:

 That's Dr. Avenlee. Don't bother him when he's like that.

Chck tchk kchk.

Riley:

 Why's he fiddling with a Rubik's cube?

Mitchell:

 That's the sound of his brain gears turning. Thinking juices are flowing. Plugged into the Matrix. I call it the Av-engine.

Riley:

 Uhh…is he the mentor you were talking about?

Mitchell:

 You'll get used to it. He's worth your time, trust me.

Avenlee paces towards the pair.

Avenlee:

 I can introduce myself, Kait.

Mitchell:

 Oh hey Alex! This is Dr. Jennifer Riley, junior researcher, PhD. in psychology. She'll be joining us shortly.

Avenlee:

 Hello Jennifer. How was the directors meeting?

Riley:

 What directors meet-

Mitchell:

 Eh. Went as well as it could've.

Avenlee:

 Cool.

Avenlee paces away.

Avenlee:

 Inversion…dark matter…

Chck kchk.

Riley:

 How often is he like this?

Mitchell:

 You'd probably want to invest in some noise-cancelling headphones.

Known elementary particles of baseline reality.

Unified Theory of Matter:

 The Standard Model is regarded as the best description of baseline reality by the consensus of the global physics community. However, there are several phenomena unaccounted for by the Standard Model, such as:

The abundance of standard baryonic matter over antimatter.

Gravitational orbits of stellar objects in the observable universe deviate from predictions. Mainstream science currently attributes these deviations to "dark matter."

The existence of anomalies.

The Foundation quantifies deviations in established physical laws using Humes. We posit that there exists a particle, which we name the 

huon

, undetected by modern instruments, which would cover the deficiencies in the Standard Model. As a corollary of this paper, we provide evidence supporting that Hume fluctuations are a symptom or after-effect of the undiscovered 

huon

 particle.

 One-on-one catchup

Mitchell:

 How much longer will it be?

Secretary:

 Apologies, Director Moose is running overtime on a meeting. Please wait a moment.

Director Shorten leaves Moose's office and enters the reception.

Shorten:

 Hey Mitchell, didn't expect to bump into you here.

Mitchell:

 Neither did I.

Shorten:

 Are you going over that "Anomaly Reversion" project with Moose? That proposal is a bold move, even for you.

Mitchell:

 You've made quite the bold move yourself, pushing for a hiring freeze at this time of the year.

Shorten:

 Well, the site budget's getting tight. We'd want our financials looking good, you know what I mean?

Mitchell:

 Yes, of course. The DHAR would help offset some of the stress, in that regard.

Shorten:

 I've been meaning to speak to you about that. Do you have some time after your meeting with Moose?

Mitchell:

 Unfortunately not, but you can find an empty slot in my calendar and we'll catch up then?

Shorten:

 I've done so twice, and you've cancelled those meetings.

Mitchell:

 I'm getting a bit overwhelmed with the new department duties and all. You know how it is.

Secretary:

 Director Mitchell, Director Moose will see you now.

Mitchell:

 Well, take care Shorten, I'll definitely prioritise your next meeting invite.

Mitchell enters the office.

Mitchell:

 Hey Moose.

Moose:

 I see you ran into Shorten out there. Funny fellow, isn't he?

Mitchell:

 I would hardly describe him that way.

Moose:

 Now, I usually don't condone sabotage among my employees. However, Shorten's actions do have a grain of truth behind them.

Mitchell:

 Yes, I know. We're heading towards a budget deficit this year.

Moose:

 Overexpenditure, I can deal with. As the director for the entire site, I'm more worried about employee morale.

Mitchell:

 Ahhh…right. A department's funding correlates with the number of anomalies they need to contain. Neutralising them isn't exactly in their best interests.

Moose:

 Yes, and we risk increasing employee redundancy. No-one wants to be out of a job when their assigned skip disappears.

Mitchell:

 And no-one wants a job here if it takes so long to get anything done. There's too many approvals to get through, for anything of consequence.

Moose:

 Look, I agree with your project in principle. It's all about the execution. Do you have your proof of concept ready?

Mitchell:

 We'll be ready to give a demo soon.

Moose:

 The sooner the better. With something tangible it'll help me convince the O5's for more funding, and to get the other directors off your back.

Magnetic field generated from a natural magnet.

False-colour image of Dr. Wettle, showing Hume variation throughout his body.

Degaussing of Hume Fields:

 The Hume Scale is calibrated such that baseline reality is assigned 1.00 Humes. At a macroscopic level, reality-benders are commonly known for exhibiting Hume fields far exceeding this baseline. At the microscopic level, however, we observe that all biological entities have variations in their Hume fields, regardless of their perceived anomalous status.

Empirical evidence shows that Humic fields behave similarly to the electromagnetic (EM) force from the Standard Model. Each electron orbit around an atom generates a miniature magnetic field. In ferromagnetic material, these orbits are aligned, cooperating to generate a noticeable magnetic field at the macroscopic scale. Non-magnetic substances have misaligned electron orbits, hence their magnetic fields "cancel out" at the macroscopic scale. In the same vein, we posit that 

huons

 in non-anomalous subjects operate at random, generating small counteractive Hume fields. In contrast, anomalous subjects, especially reality-benders, contain 

huons

 that cooperate at a large scale, and we can detect an increase in their surrounding Hume field.

Holding a magnet in an inverse magnetic field leads to its eventual demagnetisation. Unlike magnetic fields, Humes have no concept of direction. However, Humes detected in the neighbourhood of the subject vary often, particularly when the subject is actively manifesting its anomalous properties. If each minute Humic upsurge is immediately countered with a localised sub-1.00 Hume field, theory predicts that the subject's average Hume field would asymptotically converge towards 1.00. While total reversion is not feasible with this approach, it is low-risk and would be suitable candidate for a proof of concept.

Avenlee and Riley are working in opposite corners of the lab.

Avenlee:

Riley removes her headphones and walks toward Avenlee.

Avenlee:

Riley:

 Sir!

Riley snaps her fingers in front of Avenlee, and he takes off his headphones.

Avenlee:

 Hello Jennifer. It's only 2:54pm.

Riley:

 I've been stuck on this problem for an hour. This weird learning schedule isn't working out. Can't we arrange something else?

Avenlee:

 Kait said this is a good compromise. I get to focus, and the junior gets some mentorship.

Riley:

 I get that, but I-I'm sitting on my hands here. I've already read through your paper thrice over.

Avenlee:

 What did you think of it?

Riley:

 Oh uhh…it's pretty far out there. The idea that everyone has these "huons" inside of us. How do you come up with this stuff?

Avenlee:

 Nature works on a spectrum. Electromagnetic wavelength. Autism. Anomalies.

Riley:

 So there could be anomalies walking among staff right now?

Avenlee:

 Yes. For example, I've measured 

Dr. Wettle

 to have an average Hume value of 83.22.

Riley:

 THAT high? Why is this the first time I'm hearing about it?

Avenlee:

 So far, I've counted 28 researchers and 3 janitors who have Hume values higher than 1.10. I have an average Hume value of 17.14.

Riley:

 Eh? What's anomalous about you?

Avenlee:

 Ummm. I get sick pretty often.

Riley:

 Measure me.

Avenlee:

 Ok.

Avenlee opens a drawer and produces a Hume counter. He aims it Riley.

Hume Counter:

 

Tick tick tick tick. 1.000002

Riley wipes her brow.

Riley:

 Phew.

Avenlee:

 I advise you to not tell anyone what I told you.

Riley:

 About having anomalous staff? Yeah, I guess that'd be wise. Don't wanna cause a riot.

Avenlee:

 Kait said the same thing.

Riley:

 Anyway, can we rework the schedule? I feel like I'm wasting my time here.

Avenlee:

 If you get stuck, take a break. Go for a walk. Admire the facilities. Play Mario Kart.

Riley:

 I'm not tired though. If you just help me when I'm stuck, I can get things done more quickly.

Avenlee:

 There's a balance. Kait said you work too much.

Riley:

 Kait said this, Kait said that. What is she, your mum or something?

Avenlee:

 Yes.

Riley:

 Huh?

Mitchell enters the lab.

Mitchell:

 Yo! How are my favourite researchers doing?

Avenlee:

 Hi Kait. I am doing average.

Riley:

 Err…same.

Mitchell:

 Let's plan the experiments for the DHARPE. The site director wants to see a demo soon.

Avenlee:

 No. I have a headache. I'll be back after 42 minutes.

Avenlee leaves.

Riley:

 Uhh…

Mitchell:

 Don't worry about him. He just needs a break after talking for too long.

Riley:

 …

Mitchell:

 …

Awkward silence.

Riley:

 Sooo, Dr. Avenlee thinks you're his mother?

Mitchell:

 

Looks incredulously at Riley.

 Bwahaha! Yes, yes, in a way. He's been my ward since he was 7. Alex grew up here in the Foundation.

Riley:

 That sort of explains why he's…the way he is.

Mitchell:

 Yeah go easy on him. Alex hasn't had much in the way of friends. This place isn't exactly forgiving, especially for people like him.

Riley:

 How did he get here? I didn't know the Foundation adopted kids.

Mitchell:

 Well we don't. Alex's circumstances are…beyond your clearance. Maybe a story for another time.

Experiment log 8064.19:

The theory behind DHARPE rests on the assumption that 

huons

 exist. While attempts to directly observe 

huons

 have been unsuccessful, experimentation can provide empirical evidence for their existence. Our preliminary experiment inventory consists of:

20 non-anomalous D-Class personnel are exposed to DHARPE. We expect the average Hume field of each individual to remain within the value of 1.00 ± 0.00001.

If the above is successful, 10 consenting sapient humanoid anomalies would be exposed to DHARPE. We expect the average Hume field of each individual to converge towards the value of 1.00 ± 0.1.

If the above is successful, we shall approach O5-██ to discuss rolling out the initiative to other sites.

[VIDEO LOG]

The DHAR research team monitors a dashboard showing various biosignals of D-54403. DHARPE sits in a Hume-insulated chamber, humming in the background.

Avenlee:

 If you click this tab, we can see the the heatmap showing the Humic density of D-54403.

Riley:

 Ok, looks like the average Hume value is hovering over around 1. That's a good thing, right?

Avenlee:

 Yes. No. Only the average is consistent. His left hand has shifted higher to 1.25, while his head has shifted to 0.64.

Mitchell:

 That doesn't sound good. Do we declare this experiment a failure?

Avenlee:

 No. Yes. We need more SRA's and Hume counters for higher resolution. Maybe need to finetune the prediction- ah.

Mitchell:

 Another headache?

Avenlee:

 Yes. I need to leave.

Mitchell:

 

Sigh.

 Alright, release the subject, Riley.

Riley adjusts a few knobs and valves on the control panel. The attached SRA's on DHARPE gradually switch off.

Riley:

 Isn't our demo next week? What's going to happen if we have nothing to show?

Avenlee:

 It will be ok. Kait has her Mitchell magic. She can protect us from the other directors.

Mitchell:

 My 'Mitchell magic' only protects you guys. 

I

 still have to take the brunt of their bullshit.

DHARPE's chamber door opens.

Mitchell:

 Let's bring in the next D-Class when Alex is feeling better. Maybe 55043's an outlier.

Riley:

 

Ahem.

 D-55403, please return to your quarters. The security guard outside will escort you.

D-55403:

 Okay.

D-55403 lumbers towards the lab entrance.

Riley:

 Does something about him seem off to you?

Mitchell:

 Anyone would be dazed if they had to sit in DHARPE for 10 hours.

Avenlee:

 …There's something I want to check. D-55403, please state your name.

D-55403:

 Okay. Vince Brooks.

Avenlee:

 Do twenty push-ups.

D-55403:

 Okay.

D-55403 completes 10 push-ups before struggling.

Avenlee:

 Why are you incarcerated here?

Riley:

 Uhhh…

D-55403:

 Manslaughter.

Mitchell:

 Where are you going with this, Alex?

Avenlee:

 It appears D-55403 has lost some higher brain function. It's possible the DHARPE has reduced his sapience.

Mitchell:

 Shit.

D-54403:

 Okay.

D-54403 lumbers towards the lab's restroom.

 I feel like you may be wasting your potential here. How would you like to work in my department? I'll throw in a promotion for you, straight from junior to mid-level.

Riley:

 I'll need to think about-

Shorten:

 Tell me, what's it like working with Dr. Avenlee? His old coworkers say his methods are, unorthodox, to say the least.

Riley:

 He's refreshingly honest. I'd like to stick with him a little longer, but thanks, I'll give your offer some thought.

Shorten:

 …I see. Well, if you see Mitchell, tell her that I'm waiting for her. Ciao~

Shorten leaves. Riley swipes her keycard, stumbles into the lab, and wipes her brow.

Avenlee:

 Overcompensation…no…smaller magnitude…

Chck tchk kchk.

Riley:

 Alex! Talk to me.

Avenlee:

 Hello Jennifer. It is 3:06pm. You're late.

Riley:

 Sorry, just ran into Shorten outside.

Avenlee:

 Oh…

Riley:

 So, did you get my report about the sapience problem?

Avenlee:

 Yes. I arrived at the same conclusion. It's possible that sapience is caused by 

huons

.

Riley:

 I was thinking that self-awareness isn't explained by mainstream science, so it fits into the 

huon

 framework nicely.

Avenlee:

 I've been working on a new schematic for the DHARPE. It should be able to keep the Hume field around the brain above a healthy threshold.

Riley:

 Ah cool, when can we build it?

Avenlee:

 We need funding. Kait is working on her Mitchell magic.

Riley:

 Right, of course.

Avenlee:

 …

Riley:

 …

Avenlee:

 If you have no more questions, I'll get back to-

Riley:

 Actually, yes. This is kind of left field, but I'm just wondering what keeps you going every day?

Avenlee:

 I don't understand the question.

Riley:

 It's like the whole world is out to get us, you know? Our research is in uncharted territory, and I keep getting the side-eye from everyone.

Avenlee:

 I just do my best every day.

Riley:

 I mean, so do I, but-

Avenlee:

 Sometimes my best is good. Sometimes it's bad. On average it's pretty average.

Riley:

 That's a lot of words to say nothing.

Avenlee:

 I can't do the things I can't do. So I do the things that I can do.

Riley:

 Hold on, I think I get what you're saying.

Avenlee:

 Do you know Mario?

Riley:

 What, like the video game character?

Avenlee:

 In Super Mario Bros, the screen never pans backward. He can only move forward. Always forward, never scared.

Riley:

 Right, I'll just do what I can, and not worry about the rest.

Avenlee:

 Every day is a new day.

Riley:

 Thanks Alex, I needed that.

 Microsoft Skype meeting

Context:

 DHAR Showcase

Mitchell is broadcasting her computer screen to the online meeting. Seven other directors are in attendance.

Mitchell:

 Welcome everyone. I'd like to preface by apologising for pushing back this meeting. However, I bring good news. My staff have made great strides in the first implementation of the DHARPE. I'm proud to present the initial findings of my team.

28 minutes of exposition omitted.

Mitchell:

 Hence, I am formally applying for a further $420,000 to refine our design.

Moose:

 Thank you Mitchell, we'll be reviewing your application. Let's open the floor to questions.

Lorraine:

 I apologise if I misunderstood, but I think you mentioned that the motivation behind DHAR was to integrate anomalies into society? Turning them into compliant zombies doesn't seem aligned with that goal.

Mitchell:

 Yes, it's- we've hit a bit of a hurdle. We plan to iterate on this on our initial design and mitigate its side-effects.

Clarke:

 How would the refinements work? It sounds like your design hinges on this theoretical 

huon

 particle. It's a shaky assumption to make.

Shorten:

 Seconding Clarke, all the evidence pointing to its existence is circumstantial.

Mitchell:

 All modern theorems were considered outlandish at one point. Matter was thought to be infinitely divisible until we discovered the atom. Hell, we used to believe the Sun orbited Earth.

Shorten:

 And I suppose you believe your Hume theory to be just as revolutionary? That seems presumptuous.

Mitchell:

 That's why we've only allocated resources sufficient for a proof of concept. We'll disband this department if the PoC does not bear fruit. 420,000 is a drop in the ocean compared to Site-19's net expenditure.

[ 27 minutes of discussion omitted. ]

Lorraine:

 You do realise that by cutting down the number of anomalies, we'll only reduce the government's incentive to fund us.

Mitchell:

 To be blunt, these arguments will lead to the same mistakes made by psychiatric hospitals in the civilian sphere. A lot of them only focus growing the number of patients and keeping them isolated from the wider community, rather than rehabilitation.

Singer:

 Alright, let's say your proof of concept is successful. What do you suppose happens to displaced employees after their assigned skip is reverted?

Mitchell:

 We should be able to reassign them elsewhere. There's always pockets of workforce shortage around here.

Singer:

 Even if that were true-

Shorten:

 Even if it were true, our staff might not agree with this approach. There are researchers who've been working on a skip for years. Seeing all their effort go down the drain won't do good for morale.

Mitchell:

 At the same time, there are mundane anomalies or those with overly complex containment procedures. I'd think staff would be more than happy to be relieved of those responsibilities.

[ 13 minutes of discussion omitted. ]

Moose:

 Let's get back on topic. How do we prioritise which anomalies to revert first? Those with the greatest financial or logistical burden?

Mitchell:

 Yes, financial payoffs are one aspect. We should be thinking about our moral obligations as well.

Shorten:

 Moral obligations being?

Mitchell:

 Think about it. If you were confined to a cell with little in the way of mental stimulation, how would you feel year after year?

Lorraine:

 I'm not sure if it's a good idea to be humanising these things. It'll get in the way of rational judgement.

[ 38 minutes of discussion omitted. ]

Mitchell:

 Alright, so one strong example is Dr. Wettle. For those who don't know, Dr. Wettle is an ontokinetic probability sink, and he's given us consent for a reversion trial.

Moose:

 I see where you're going with this. Dr. Wettle has a proven track record in his tenure, despite being anomalous.

Shorten:

 I'm not sure Dr. Wettle is a good example of a candidate. There's been some talk around giving him a Thaumiel classification due to his positive effects on Site-43's productivity.

Lorraine:

 Also, this is just one example. How can you be confident that all of them would function well as staff? How can you be sure an anomaly will remain compliant and obey orders?

Mitchell:

 To gauge that, I'm proposing a gradual roll-out, starting with the more docile anomalies. Besides, this a bit of a moot point, because even regular staff are known for insubordination.

Clarke:

 There's also the cost of upskilling the anomaly to work in whichever position we give to it.

Mitchell:

 Yes, but if we give them the right environment to work in, this cost would pay for itself once they become a self-sufficient, productive employee.

[ 26 minutes of discussion omitted ]

Clarke:

 For the record, I don't disagree with your idea in principle, but you haven't provided a way for us to navigate the complexity of logistical changes involved.

Shorten:

 Yes, apologies Mitchell, we just need to see something more concrete. At the moment I'm not really convinced by your proposal for a gradual, iterative reversion of the anomalous.

Mitchell:

 Your face is anomalous.

Shorten:

 …

Mitchell:

 Ah fuck I wasn't muted.

 Re: Reversion of SCP-7198

Dear Director Mitchell,

Apologies for not getting back to you sooner; I've just returned from sabbatical. My understanding is that in my absence, Director Moose has cleared 

SCP-7198

 for experimentation within the DHAR.

Please reconsider neutralising it.

The flesh of SCP-7198 has intrinsic physical and mental restorative effects. It has already been trialled in select MTF assignments and has been well-received by our agents. Moreover, my liaisons from the U.S. pharmaceutical industry have expressed interest in embedding 7198 material into the public sector. Greenfield drug innovation would improve shareholder confidence in those companies, and in turn, cement them as reliable sponsors for the Foundation.

Although I agree that the extraction process is inhumane, my staff have reported that SCP-7198 is acclimating to the process, and that it's been convinced it's serving the good of humanity. That said, I can sympathise with the goals behind your department. If you like, I can refer you to other candidates for your experiments and put in a good word for you.

 Yes, that's right. Tell me if you need help with anything. We're still depending on you for the DHARPE project.

 Speaking of DHARPE, Director Shorten will be taking over the department temporarily.

 We'll publicise the news shortly, but I thought you should hear it from me.

 Mitchell has received too many votes of no confidence. I'm sorry Alex.

 You're the Site Director. I thought you supported us. Supported Kait.

 Ongoing cooperation

Dear Ms. Lorraine,

We've confirmed the president-elect's inauguration to occur on January 20. I'm glad to inform you that he looks forward to our continued partnership with the SCP Foundation.

As you may know, the incoming administration is intending to crack down on violent crime and illegal immigration. We will need to secure contracts to expand our prison infrastructure, however, we expect some opposition in Congress, as well as from public sentiment.

As the Foundation depends on the DOJ for its human resources, I expect that the approval of these contracts would have a positive impact on your operations. If you could provide us your perspective and/or assistance on this matter, it would be greatly appreciated.

 Re: DHARPE trial roll-out

Attachment(s):

 acquisition_contract.pdf

Dear Ms. Lorraine,

We have completed the initial trials across across eight correctional facilities. Of the 112 inmates trialled, 110 have demonstrated increased compliance. We've had to terminate the other two; one has experienced brain death, while the other has developed abilities to [REDACTED].

Our leadership team supports the initiative to introduce the DHARPE to our other facilities. This should help silence public concerns that we "fail to rehabilitate" our inmates.

Attached is an order for sixteen more of these machines. I imagine you will find these terms quite favourable. As a show of good faith, I've just given sign-off for a shipment of a further 300 inmates for your so-called "D-Class".

Best,

 A message from Shorten || 2016 Reflections

Hola~

Thank you to everyone who attended the Site-19 All Hands yesterday. I am both thrilled and humbled by the positive reception from fellow staff. Like some of you may know, the Department of Humanoid Anomaly Reversion has been rebranded as the Department of Humanoid Correction (DHC). Despite our short tenure, the DHC has already strengthened ties with our sponsors, and improved the working efficiency of our D-Class personnel. While the DHAR has faced challenges during its inception, I would like to thank Dr. Riley for laying the groundwork and collaborating with me to make the DHC a great success.

Please don't hesitate reach out to me if you have any further enquiries about the DHC. I am filled with excitement and optimism about our journey ahead.

 One-on-one catchup

Moose:

 Welcome back Kaitlyn, did you enjoy your break?

Mitchell:

 Not hardly. When am I going to be reinstated back to the DHAR?

Moose:

 There's a meeting next week to discuss that, Mitchell.

Mitchell:

 What's there to discuss? Shorten just came in and bastardised the whole thing. I'll reel us back on track.

Moose:

 Director Shorten has entrenched the DHC pretty deeply into the Foundation's dependencies. Most departments are very happy with the extra resources he's imparted for them.

Mitchell:

 Yeah but- this funding is just a bandaid over the problems in this site- no, the whole organisation. We're still building new containment facilities just because there's too many anomalies.

Moose:

 You've heard his spiel at the All Hands right? He almost has site-wide support. If I openly denounce him, even 

my

 position would be threatened.

Mitchell:

 Oh? I didn't realise you cared much for your title. Whatever happened to the 'greater good'?

Moose:

 Don't pretend that your DHAR project is selfless either. You only started the department to help your precious Alex.

Mitchell:

 How's he faring? My clearance hasn't been fully reinstated yet, so I haven't been able to look through his file.

Moose:

 We're still determining the correlation of his tumour. It'll become a matter for the O5's if it's-

Mitchell:

 I don't care about that. How is 

he

 doing?

Moose:

 He's comatose. Stable, but unconscious.

Mitchell:

 When I left, there were still a lot of refinements planned for the DHARPE. It's going to be a while before we can cure him.

Moose:

 Shorten's actually been looking to dumb down your DHARPE machine in order to mass-produce it. Riley's been getting a lot of praise in that regard. I think she's even starting to appreciate Shorten. 

Chuckles.

Mitchell:

 Then I'll just have to reel her back on track too. With Alex gone, she's the one with the most technical know-how.

Moose:

 Whatever you do, you'll need to be quick. Some folks are pushing to reclass Avenlee as Thaumiel, which would make it much harder to request for his neutralisation.

Mitchell:

 Pieces of shit.

Moose:

 I'll see what I can do to put the DHAR back into your hands. It's going to be an uphill battle.

Mitchell:

 Let's give it our best. Always forward, never scared, Moose.
