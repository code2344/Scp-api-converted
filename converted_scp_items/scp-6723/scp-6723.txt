Item #: SCP-6723

Initial observations:

Child's body

Doesn't decay

Unusually large amt of dust

Abnormally cold

Background:

Child named Ruth Clark

Cause of death still unknown?

Objectives:

Reason it doesn't decay

Cause of death if possible

More about background

Notes:

I'm hoping this project goes better after all the drama last time. It should be simpler, at least. I'll just stick to the objectives.

I know I messed up, but being transferred to this site feels like a bit much. As far as I can tell, they really don't have many resources here. It just seems to be where the higher-ups dump things that aren't big or important. Despite the obvious lack of funding, though, my division head is in everyone's business, acting like the Foundation actually cares if we get this stuff done.

I'll be submitting material requests soon; have to think about what would help determine the whole not decaying thing.

Item #: SCP-6723

Objectives:

Reason it doesn't decay

Cause of death

Background

Ideas:

Autopsy

Pros: Quick compared to others, could provide insight into cause of death + possible anomalies

Cons: Destructive

Seeding whole body w/ bacteria, fungus, etc

Pros: Provides insight into possible anomalies - can things grow?

Cons: Could be destructive, possibly time-consuming

Growing bacteria, fungus, etc on sample

Pros: Provides insight into possible anomalies w/o damaging whole body, less time-consuming than whole body

Cons: Possibly less accurate - anomaly could be w/ whole body, possibly time consuming

Messing w/ environment

Pros: Will find out how body reacts to different environments

Cons: Uses a lot of space, time consuming

Monitoring temperature?

Pros: Unclear

Cons: Unclear

Notes:

I'll submit these ideas for approval and then request materials. I don't know if the temperature one would actually help anything, but Derek suggested it when I said the body was cold, so who am I to argue?

Apparently, I'm the only one on this project. I'm not complaining, but it feels weird after being at 19 for so long. At least this means there are fewer people that could mess this up for me.

Objectives:

Reason it doesn't decay

Cause of death

Background

Notes:

The sample idea got approved. If I don't get much in the way of results, I'll move on to seeding the whole body, which will, of course, complicate things a bit.

While I'm waiting on the Petri dishes, I'll look into Ruth's past; I'm curious as to whether there may have been someone in her life on our side of the veil. Maybe thaumaturgy?

Cutting out the samples was a bit difficult. Not in a physical way, but I kind of feel like I'm still being punished for my mistake.

Item #: SCP-6723

Objectives:

Reason it doesn't decay

Cause of death

Background

Background info:

From small town

Redwick, PA

Three siblings

Condition:

No changes around the area that the sample was taken from.

Dusty again

Notes:

I didn't have much luck in investigating her 

backgru

 background online. I'll see if I can get anything with Foundation-based resources, but I doubt that they keep records on random people.

I cleaned off the dust since I was a bit worried about it accumulating in the sample area. In hindsight, I probably shouldn't have done that; it could have interfered with the anomaly. I think it was more of a spur-of-the-moment thing.

04/06/21

Item #: SCP-6723

Objectives:

Reason it doesn't decay

Cause of death

Background

Background notes:

Average grades

Parents seemed not to care much

Condition:

No noticeable changes.

Notes:

Unsurprisingly, I didn't have much luck with Foundation resources, either. Derek told me to focus on the actual anomaly, so no more background research, I guess.

My hand kind of hurt when I woke up this morning. Nothing bad, but it's pretty itchy now. Hopefully, the thing didn't come back for my remaining hand.

I'm going to sample the dust and make sure it's not the 

cas

 cause.

04/07/21

Item #: SCP-6723

Objectives:

Reason it doesn't decay

Cause of death

Condition:

No noticeable 

ca

 changes aside from dust accumulation.

Notes:

I was a bit nervous about looking into the dust after Derek's comments on my investigation, so I ended up not doing it.

Probably just me, but I kind of wish he'd stay out of everyone's business; he's not even a scientist.

04/08/21

Item #: SCP-6723

Objectives:

Reason it doesn't decay

Cause of death

Condition:

Dust

Notes:

I've mostly been waiting around today. Derek doesn't want me to work on anything but the actual anomaly, so just 

st

 sitting around for me.

Item #: SCP-6723

Objectives:

Reason it doesn't decay

Cause of 

da

 death

Condition:

Dusty

Notes:

I didn't do much at all today. Since I'll be checking the samples tomorrow, I'll ask about the dust.

I've been thinking about the incident from the last project, and I'm wondering if Derek knows. Hopefully not, but it would explain why he's been hovering over my shoulder so much.

04/10/21

Item #: SCP-6723

Objectives:

Reason it doesn't decay

Cause of death

Trial 1:

Inconclusive results; no growth in control or test groups.

Notes:

I must have done something wrong, 

sei

 seeing as nothing grew. I made sure to double-check everything for the second trial, so hopefully, whatever I did wrong won't come up again.

I failed to ask about the dust, but I did ask if they had any other 

im

 information. It turns out they did a CT scan and failed to give me the report. Hopefully, I'll get it within the next few days.

Condition:

Dusty

Notes:

I 

ti

 think my migraines are starting to come back. It's unrelated to the case at hand, but I thought 

t

 it was worth pointing out.

I was thinking about the incident again, and I realized my 

mas

 mistake shouldn't have mattered as much as it did. So what if I didn't hear 

se

 someone once? I have a good track record. I dealt with it quickly.

 revealed mostly normal results, with a few 

ec

 exceptions:

Large foreign body

Ha

 Heart may have transmuted into something 

ini

 inorganic

Numerous rib fractures

Believed to be postmortem

Notes:

I've been struggling a bit with writing; I think it has to do with the 

migran

 migraines.

Derek is 

str

 starting to nag me about results, which, of course, adds to the stress.

I just 

hev

 have to keep doing this. Things will

 change.

I was feeling

Dr

 Derek says I have to pick up the pace, so this is the last trial of this, I
