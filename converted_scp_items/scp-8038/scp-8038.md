**Description:**
SCP-8038 refers to Episode 79 of the 1993 Japanese anime _Sparkling Butterfly_. On June 1st, 2022, SCP-8038 began to appear on both illegal and legal anime streaming sites and platforms online, as well as retroactively on previously-released physical media (VHS, Laserdisc, Blu-Ray, etc.). As only 78 episodes were produced, the sudden existence of a fully-created 79th episode, as well as its appearance on physical media was determined significant enough for Foundation intervention.
Additionally, while the original 78 episodes of _Sparkling Butterfly_ would often focus on either regular life for Fujimiya or her battles against the evil Crystallizing as the mahou shoujo[1](javascript:;) Sparkling Butterfly, SCP-8038 focuses on the titular character reconciling with the main villain of the series. It is also notable that SCP-8038's run time is significantly shorter than any of the episodes of the original series with a run time of approximately 10 minutes, as opposed to the normal 24 minutes and ten seconds.
The following excerpts are taken from the English Wikipedia article for familiarization purposes.
**_Sparkling Butterfly_** (Japanese: 煌めきバタフライ, Hepburn: _Kirameki Batofurai_) also stylized as **_Sparkling! 🦋 BUTTERFLY_** ( キラキラ🦋タフライ, _Kirakira Batofurai_), is a Japanese magical girl anime television series written and produced by Sakura Animations which aired from 1993 to 1995 on MiraiTV and ran for two seasons with a total run of 78 episodes. The series follows Ageha Fujimiya, a 15-year-old high school student who is recruited by the mysterious Dumach and taught how to transform into the magical Sparkling Butterfly, a superheroine with the ability to fight the evil empress Crystallizing who wishes to corrupt the world. While not fighting evil, Fujimiya deals with her daily life and growing up.
  

In North America and Europe, the anime was released through online streaming on the _AnimePalace_ streaming service. Due to the series' cult status, an official blu-ray was also released in 2018. No English dub has been produced for the series.
  

Characters
**Ageha Fujimiya** (藤宮 揚羽, _Fujimiya Ageha_) / **Sparkling Butterfly** (スパークリング・バタフライ, _Supākuringu Batofurai_)
Voiced by: Masuyo Inoue
A kind 15-year-old girl that attends Itogahara High School. She is cheerful and upbeat, with many friends in her class. After being given the power to transform into the superheroine Sparkling Butterfly by Dumach, she promises to fight the monsters sent by her arch-rival, Crystallizing. She loves gardening, insects, and nature. Aspires to be an entomologist. At the end of the series, she chooses to be the last holder of the Sparkling Butterfly title.
**Minami Suzuki** (鈴木 みなみ, _Suzuki Minami_)
Voiced by: Chiho Yonemura
A 15-year-old girl who is Fujimiya's best friend. She is the only one who knows about Fujimiya's ability to transform into Sparkling Butterfly. Although powerless, she supports her best friend and often covers for Fujimiya in class so she can defeat Crystallizing. She is a lot shyer than Fujimiya but very friendly once she is able to connect with someone new.
**Haruki Yamamoto** (山本 春木, _Yamamoto Haruki_)
Voiced by: Tetsuya Kagawa
A popular 17-year-old boy who also attends Itogahara High School. He is charming and elegant, which has caused almost every girl in the school to fall for him, including Fujimiya. He is friends with Fujimiya and Suzuki, and it is implied that he has a crush on Suzuki. One of the series's running gags involves him loudly praising Sparkling Butterfly's efforts in front of Fujimiya.
**Nobu Shimada** (島田 城, _Shimada Nobu_) / **Crystallizing** (クリスタライジング, _Kurisutaraijingu_)
Voiced by: Yūri Kai
An evil, chaotic adult woman with the ability to cocoon people and turn their greatest desires into a monster called a Chrysalis. Her plots are often disrupted by Fujimiya, who she considers her greatest enemy. She works in disguise at Itogahara Middle School as a PE teacher, but is initially unaware that Fujimiya is Sparkling Butterfly.
In the final several episodes, it is revealed that she was the original Sparkling Butterfly. Unwillingly forced into the position by Dumach, she rebelled and was subsequently cursed by him, leading to her becoming Crystallizing. She is heavily injured in the finale, and implied to have died.
**Mashhit Dumach** (マッシュヒーツ・ドゥーマック, _Masshuhītsu Doūmakku_)
Voiced by: Kaneto Shiozawa
A mysterious, well-dressed young man who gives Fujimiya the power to become Sparkling Butterfly. Claiming to be an emissary for good, he instructs Fujimiya to fight Crystallizing's attempts to debauch the world.
At the end of the series, it is revealed that he is directly responsible for Crystallizing's condition. While mostly appearing to be an affable and friendly man, he is actually a very vindictive spider-like being that feeds on chaos and fear. In the finale, both Sparkling Butterfly and Crystallizing work together to defeat him.

**Addendum 01:** Discovery
SCP-8038 first came to Foundation attention on June 1st, 2022, when a Foundation webcrawler picked up possible anomaly keyphrases on a popular forum board dedicated to anime wherein fans of _Sparkling Butterfly_ discussed a mysterious new 79th episode of the series.

So this might not really be the place for this, but this is the anime board after all so I thought I’d post here. I was going to rewatch Sparkling Butterfly so I could make some more fanart, and on PlaceForAnime I noticed there was a 79th episode. I thought this was a mistake at first and was just like a copy of one of the other episodes, so I decided to watch it to make sure. NOPE. It’s a completely new episode and it’s still in the animation style of the original series. The plot was really strange to me, as it was about Fujimiya forgiving Crystallizing for everything she did seven years after the series ended. It also was way shorter than a normal episode at just 10 minutes. But there was one really major change that stood out. Crystallizing was a dude. Like we all know she was a woman (yes I'm aware of what the writers planned originally and all but it unfortunately doesn't count). Is this like their way of starting a reboot or something? And why didn’t they announce its release? Why dump it straight to streaming platforms? Did anyone else see this?  

SoleilFruit | JUN. 01, 2022 | #267422742
I saw this too, and I honestly wondered if I was going crazy. They even brought back OP1, Kagayaku! Shining Butterfly. Not that I mind the changes, but it’s something that was really strange to me. Feels like a pretty good follow up to the kinda depressing ending though.
Nutrababy | JUN. 01, 2022 | #267423034 >>267423106
Sakura Animation actually posted about this on their socials
They stated that they didn’t make the episode there are no plans for a reboot or anything and they’re actually trying to figure out where it came from
SoleilFruit | JUN. 01, 2022 | #267423106
>>267423034  
Whoa really? That’s like really weird
gandamudato [OP] | JUN. 01, 2022 | #267423117 >>267423153
I just checked their socials and yep, it’s true. They also clarified that Crystallizing was "open to interpretation" but written as a woman. In the new episode, she talks about how she’s happy to finally be herself. Or uh, his self? She says that he's a guy now. Do you think a fan made this trying to project a headcanon onto the character? Like rewriting the finale? It's too high quality to be a fanwork though…
Nutrababy | JUN. 01, 2022 | #267423153 >>267423452
>>#267423117  
Possibly
But then how would it have gotten on official streaming platforms if it was a fan project
Maybe it's a leak of an anniversary special or something and they're trying to cover it up. It's almost the 30th anniversary in a couple of years so
gandamudato [OP] | JUN. 01, 2022 | #267423452
>>#267423153  
That’s a good point, this is really weird.
CrystallizingCrystal | JUN. 01, 2022 | #267423553 >>267423699 >>267423880 >>267424525
you guys may not care about the change, but i do. like the whole point of crystallizing is she's meant to be a WOMAN. if they wanted her to be some fugly dude, it woulda been in the show. she was supposed to be the hot and sexy anime villain that fans could love like what the fuck is this woke shit

ARE YOU STUPID?
Moonlightlegend | JUN. 01, 2022 | #267423452
>>267423553  
Found the media illiterate.
It's always the damn Crystallizing fans man. Do you have enough braincells to pick up on subtext? The show always hinted that there was something off with him, that he was longing for something he couldn't have (and no it wasn't fucking defeating Sparkling Butterfly)
did you see the finale? did we even watch the same show
CrystallizingCrystal | JUN. 01, 2022 | #267424097 >>267424097
SHE!!! crystallizing is a GIRL!!! a fucking dommy mommy bad bitch. stop with that woke shit
Moonlightlegend | JUN. 01, 2022 | 267424221
>>267424097  
low effort bait you're so gonna get banned
Rev Girl Utena | JUN. 01, 2022 | #267424525
>>267423553  
You legit sound like ep. 77 Dumach rn
Aurabug27 | JUN. 02, 2022 | #267425290
Could anyone find out anything about who the new voice actor for Crystallizing is? Ageha sounds the exact same too which is really weird considering it's been almost 30 years and her original voice actress is in her 50s now. Plus if you look back at the promos from a couple of years ago for the blue ray she sounds noticeably different. There are no credits and I've never heard this voice actor for Crystallizing before.
gandamudato [OP] | JUN. 02, 2022 | #267425380
>>#267425290  
I looked into it, and I couldn't find a thing. Someone asked Masuyo Inoue, Fujimiya's seiyuu, since she's active on twitter, and she said she hasn't done any voice work for Sparkling Butterfly since the HD release.
Aurabug27 | JUN. 02, 2022 | #267425452
>>267423553  
This is weird as hell.
gandamudato [OP] | JUN. 02, 2022 | #267425680
OK so I grabbed my HD Blu Ray to check if I could find anything in the extras on it but I swear im going crazy. The freaky part is that this episode shows up in the episode list on my DVD. My Blu Ray DVD from four years ago. Like, it's there, labeled as Episode 79. It was absolutely NOT there before man this has to be some Mandela Effect shit.

**Addendum 02:** Episode Transcripts [67 & SCP-8038]
Due to the contents of SCP-8038 being significantly different from the original series of _Sparkling Butterfly_ , a translated transcript of the original show has been included for comparison. Full transcripts of all the episodes and SCP-8038 are available by contacting the Foundation Photo-Video Analysis Review Department [PVARD].
The following is a portion of a transcript from Episode 67.
**[Transcript is from 13:37-18:51 out of 24:10.]**
EXT. PARK - DAY
Fujimiya and Suzuki are sitting at a bench in a public park, both in their school uniforms.
FUJIMIYA
Aaaaaauuh! It's my fault Yamamoto got in trouble… he took the blame for me! I was the one who was peeking at the contest results.
SUZUKI
It's not like you meant bad by it, you were only trying to see if Matsudaira was cheating.
FUJIMIYA
But now Yamamoto is going to be mad at me! He was just trying to hide the barrette I dropped in there… waaaaaaah, what should I do, Minami-chan?
Fujimiya grabs Suzuki by the shoulders and shakes her.
SUZUKI
Ageha, if he really was angry at you, he wouldn't have risked trying to pick up your barrette for you!
Fujimiya stops shaking Suzuki.
FUJIMIYA
Ah, that's true, isn't it?
SUZUKI
It is! If you're really worried, why don't you write him a letter?
FUJIMIYA
But writing letters is your thing…
Suzuki reaches into her bag.
SUZUKI
Everyone can do it! Letters are the gateway to the soul! What's a better way to express your feelings than to write them down?
She pulls out a pen and notepad and hands it to Fujimiya.
SUZUKI
I love writing letters to people. That's why my dream is to be a writer. So I can express my feelings in writing!
Fujimiya takes the pen and paper, with a sulking frown on her face.
FUJIMIYA
I guess I could try it for you, Minami…
Suzuki smiles and claps her hands together.
SUZUKI
That's the spirit! You're always trying to do the right thing, Ageha-chan. I'm sure expressing yourself will clear up everything between you and Yamamoto.
A voice from behind them startles them.
CRYSTALLIZING
How cute. But as if writing measly little letters is going to solve anything.
Crystallizing appears in the sky, floating above the two on a pack of dark-colored butterflies.  
  
Fujimiya gasps.
FUJIMIYA
Crystallizing!
SUZUKI
Do you have to ruin every nice moment?
CRYSTALLIZING
Hmph! The same goes for your friend. Every time I'm about to succeed, she always ruins it with her sparkly little gleams of light. But not this time!
Crystallizing reaches out her hand, pointing it towards Suzuki.
CRYSTALLIZING
Dark wings, show the desire in her heart, and trap it where it'll never flourish!
A dark aura surrounds Suzuki, causing her to fall unconscious. She is lifted into the sky, a dark cocoon wrapping itself around her. After she is trapped, a giant monster shaped like an envelope with a butterfly seal appears. It ROARS.
FUJIMIYA
Minami, wait for me! I'll protect you!
The background is replaced with a glowing orange and gold aura. A sparkling silhouette of Fujimiya is seen. A butterfly-themed wand appears in her hand. Her hair falls out of the low pigtails it's in, now flowing loose. Fujimiya waves the wand over her head, her hair growing longer, then moves to tie itself up in two large high ponytails. Next, she points the wand over her torso, a puffy-sleeved top and a short but multiple-layered frilly skirt appears. She points the wand at her legs, thigh-length stockings with lace at the top appearing. She then points the wand to her feet, two orange heels with golden butterflies at the toe of each shoe forming. Short gloves form around her hands. Lastly, she points the wand at her face. Makeup appears on her face, and her eyes turn from brown to orange.  
  
Sparkling Butterfly lands on the ground in a pose, ready to fight. She looks at the cocoon Minami has been trapped in, an angry expression on her face.
SPARKLING BUTTERFLY (FUJIIMIYA)
You’ve really done it this time, Crystallizing!
The monster starts towards Sparkling Butterfly. She dodges the attack, swiftly moving to the side.
CRYSTALLIZING
Oh? Is this what angers you, Little Sparkler? I’d argue I’ve done much worse.
Crystallizing places a finger on her chin.  
  
Sparkling Butterfly jumps up into the air. She does a flip, then jumps towards the giant monster, kicking it with extreme force, causing it to stumble backward with a loud groan.
SPARKLING BUTTERFLY
You turned my precious Minami into a Chrysalis! I didn’t think you’d stoop so low! What did she do to you, huh?
Crystallizing throws her head back, giving a hearty laugh.
CRYSTALLIZING
What did she do to me? What did she do to me? It’s not about what _she_ did to me. Or about what anyone I target has done to me. You wouldn't understand! You're just a child. You don't live in reality! Chrysalis, after her!
The Chrysalis gets back up from the ground, starting after Sparkling Butterfly once more.  
  
Sparkling Butterfly dodges its punch once again.
SPARKLING BUTTERFLY
I live in reality more than you do! I help my parents with their business! I attend school and keep my grades high! And I have to stop you from terrorizing innocent people! All Minami wanted was to show herself through her letters! What do you want, huh? To ruin people’s lives?
Crystallizing scoffs.
CRYSTALLIZING
Don't joke around. All you do is what people tell you to do! Life doesn't care for what people want or hope. Once you understand that, the better off you'll be! That's the real truth! Chrysalis, don’t just stand there, get her!
The Chrysalis starts towards Sparkling Butterfly, successfully landing a hit, causing the girl to be thrown into a nearby building.  
  
Sparkling Butterfly slowly pushes herself back up to stand.
SPARKLING BUTTERFLY
You're right, I don't understand that, and I never will! I won't ever live like that!
The background behind Sparkling Butterfly becomes sparkling hues of orange and gold. She raises her wand up.
SPARKLING BUTTERFLY
Sparkling Butterfly Sparkle Bomb!
A still from Episode 67.
Sparkling Butterfly aims the wand at the Chrysalis. It is soon blasted by the ray of sparkles and orange butterflies, causing it to disappear.
SPARKLING BUTTERFLY
Spread your wings, Minami!
The cocoon holding an unconscious Suzuki gently folds open, causing her to fall down from the sky. Sparkling Butterfly dashes over to Suzuki, catching the girl.  
  
An angry expression is on Crystallizing’s face.
CRYSTALLIZING
Of course you save your little friend and the day once again! That’s all you ever want. You'll never learn!
Crystallizing disappears in a cloud of black butterflies.  
  
Sparkling Butterfly looks down at her unconscious friend, and strokes her hair.
SPARKLING BUTTERFLY
Unforgivable. What does Crystallizing want? She constantly puts innocent people in danger. I will always protect the world from her! What she wants will never matter to anyone!
  
  
  
The following is the transcript of SCP-8038, Episode 79.

The opening titles of _Sparkling Butterfly_ plays.
EXT. PARK - DAY
Fujimiya and Suzuki approach a bench in the park covered by a tree. Suzuki is wearing a jacket and a t-shirt with slacks; Fujimiya is wearing dress shirt and dress pants. Suzuki is holding onto Fujimiya, her arm interlinked with Fujimiya's. They stop short a small distance away from the bench.  
  
Suzuki turns towards Fujimiya.
SUZUKI
My opinion on this is still the same… but if you need me, give me a shout and I'll step in, okay?
She leans in and kisses her on the cheek.
FUJIMIYA
It'll be just like back then. I promise!
SUZUKI
That's what I'm worried about…
Fujimiya breaks off from Suzuki and approaches the bench. Sitting at the bench is CRYSTALLIZING: his body type is more masculine, and he's wearing jeans and a sweater. He leans back in the bench as Fujimiya approaches and sits down.  
  
After sitting in silence for about a minute, Fujimiya speaks.
FUJIMIYA
I suppose I should start, then.
CRYSTALLIZING
No, I should. It was a real longshot — I expected to… I wasn't really prepared.
He sighs.
CRYSTALLIZING
I'm sorry for everything I put you through. I know it doesn't excuse that—
FUJIMIYA
You're right, it doesn't. But I've seen what you've been doing ever since then — I think that speaks more than any apology you could give me.
CRYSTALLIZING
Maybe. I'm not exactly proud of who I used to be.
A still from SCP-8038.
# 
FUJIMIYA
I should apologize, too. Back then, I'd never questioned what I'd been told — if only I had just reached out and asked…
Crystallizing laughs.
CRYSTALLIZING
You don't need to apologize. I was the villain and you were the hero, remember? That's just the way things were written.
FUJIMIYA
We have other options now.
CRYSTALLIZING
Villains aren't supposed to get a second chance. You're supposed to defeat them and save the day.
FUJIMIYA
Didn't we already? Together?
Both are silent for a little while.
FUJIMIYA
You know, it's funny that we're both themed after butterflies. Butterflies signify growth and change and becoming someone new, yet we just stayed the same all that time. Whose poor choice was that?
Crystallizing smirks.
CRYSTALLIZING
I think we know the answer to that better than anyone else.
FUJIMIYA
It's in our hands now, at least.
CRYSTALLIZING
I appreciate you giving me this, Fujimiya. I never wanted to be like that. I never asked for it.
_(beat)_
I’m happy I get to be who I want to be now, but I'm not sure I deserve it.
FUJIMIYA
There's no excuse for all the people you hurt, but you've tried every moment since you recovered to atone for what you did. In that process, you found yourself. You deserve that happiness. What kind of hero would I be if I didn't give everyone a chance?
Crystallizing leans back in the bench further.
CRYSTALLIZING
I could learn a thing or two from you.
FUJIMIYA
I'm only paying back the favor. Now that you're who you want to be… what is your dream?
CRYSTALLIZING
What's my dream?
He pauses.
CRYSTALLIZING
I can't say I've thought about it.
FUJIMIYA
That's okay! As Minami always tells me, there's always time to find it. Speaking of —
Fujimiya stands up.
FUJIMIYA
I promised her I'd keep it short. She says she won't ever forgive you, but — and don't tell her this — sometimes I catch her reminiscing about those days in PE with our beloved Shimada-sensei.
CRYSTALLIZING
Calling me that only makes me feel old. Just call me Nobuhiko, okay?
FUJIMIYA
That's a good name. Okay, Mr. Nobuhiko then. Bye for now, but you know how to contact me! I want to talk to you again sometime, alright?
He nods.  
  
Fujimiya stands up and walks back over to Suzuki. As the two start to walk away, Suzuki turns around and waves back at Crystallizing.  
  
He returns the wave, and Suzuki continues walking with Fujimiya.
CRYSTALLIZING
quietly  
Kids nowadays…
He covers his face in his hands and softly cries.

**Addendum 03:** Containment Procedure Deliberation
After a period of discussion with media containment specialists, it was decided that the containment procedures will be as follows:
> The Foundation will conduct a disinformation campaign with the assistance of Sakura Animations that SCP-8038 is the 79th episode; while unreleased on television, it was included in all home media releases and also remastered in 2018 for the 25th anniversary. Any previous online activity that contradicts this cover story is to be erased. Monitoring of changes in SCP-8038 behavior will continue. However, due to the acceptance of SCP-8038 by the show's community and lack of further anomalous activity, it is highly likely that any further Foundation intervention (if at all) will be extremely minimal.
A suggested object class change to `Safe, pending Neutralized` is in the process of being approved as well.
