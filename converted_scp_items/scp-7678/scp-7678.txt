Item #: SCP-7678

Thaumiel

Special Containment Procedures:

 N/A.

Description:

 SCP-7678 is a Foundation-made memetic agent embedded in the 

automated introductory email

 that is sent to all newly hired employees.

SCP-7678 is designed to alter an individual's sense of identity and beliefs, aligning them with the Foundation's ideological expectations for its personnel and erasing traits deemed hindering or disruptive to the Foundation's mission.

Chae Myung-Ki, head of the Memetics Department.

History:

 With the arrival of the World Wide Web to the public in 1993, the Overseer Council began seeking a more efficient and reliable alternative to the Department of Reform,

1

 given the considerable resource expenditure and questionable practices of the department, which often put the Overseers at odds with the Ethics Committee.

In August of 1993, O5-1 personally commissioned the Department of Memetic Studies

2

 to create a memetic agent capable of replicating the effects of the therapy carried out by the Department of Reform without the need for physical or extensive intervention, the result of which is SCP-7678.
