I just wanted back a piece of what I lost in my childhood. What the flames and smoke took from me. Is that so bad, Henry?

SCP-8104

Special Containment Procedures:

[+] Original

[-] Original

SCP-8104 is currently mounted inside Research Lab 13 at Site-83. Staff that wish to access SCP-8104 must complete and submit Request Form 27-A to Researcher Cassandra Easton for approval. Any objects generated during staff interactions with SCP-8104 must be kept or destroyed.

Revision One

SCP-8104 is stored in a secure locker inside Secure Access Wing 4 at Site-83. The locker containing SCP-8104 is not to be opened outside of testing. When SCP-8104 is removed from the locker for testing, the two robotic arms attached to the locker are to be used. Under no circumstances are staff to touch SCP-8104. All objects created by SCP-8104 are to be destroyed.

A selection of toys generated by SCP-8104 before containment

Description:

 SCP-8104 is a shelf constructed of wood and stainless steel. SCP-8104's anomalous effect manifests when touched by a human over the age of 13. When touched by such an individual, SCP-8104 will generate at least one toy lost by the individual during their childhood. SCP-8104 remains inert when touched by humans under the age of 13, and by individuals over the age of 13 who did not lose any toys during their childhood. There is no known limit to the number of toys that SCP-8104 can generate at once.

Discovery:

 SCP-8104 was discovered in an abandoned house in Brisbane, Australia. The Foundation was alerted to the existence of SCP-8104 when 52-year-old Alan Gibbon began selling toys generated by the anomaly. Most toys created during Gibbon's interactions with SCP-8104 were worthless. However, several of the toys generated are considered to be collectibles and are highly sought after in the resale market. Gibbons had created accounts on eBay and various vintage toy sites to sell the toys, creating an uproar in the collectible toy community. This alerted the Foundation, and an investigation was launched.

Gibbons was tracked to an abandoned home in an outer western suburb of Brisbane. Upon entry, messages that had been scrawled on the walls were observed by Foundation agents, all of which related to chores Gibbons needed to complete, or debts he owned to various local loan sharks. These messages include: ‘When you next read this, buy toilet paper,’ ‘Pay off Martin by tuesday’ and ‘Collect money. Send toys. Don’t forget again.’

Gibbons was found in the master bedroom, along with an old laptop and SCP-8104. Upon spotting the Foundation agents, Gibbons became hostile. He ran to SCP-8104 and began rapidly tapping it, throwing the resulting toys at the agents. However, all toys produced were either too small, or too soft to be effective projectiles. Gibbons was quickly detained, amnesticized and released and SCP-8104 was bought into containment.

MTF Alpha-4 ('Pony Express') were able to intercept toys already shipped by Gibbons and substitute them with fakes. The toys were then sent to Site-83 for testing alongside SCP-8104. When they were found to be non-anomolous, they were destroyed.

Present:

 Researcher Cassandra Easton, Junior Researcher Rosen and Junior Researcher Adams

[BEGIN LOG]

Easton:

 Ok let's get started. I'd like to get home while my son is still awake.

Rosen:

 Understood Researcher Easton.

Adams steps forward and touches SCP-8104's right steel bracket. Three toys manifest on the shelf. They are a Spider-Man action figure, a slinky and a teddy bear dressed in a pirate outfit with a black felt beard.

Adams:

 Mr Blackbeard?

Adams reaches out and picks up the teddy bear.

Adams:

 Holy shit! It's you, Mr Blackbeard.

Adams hugs the teddy bear.

Easton:

 Do you recognise the bear?

Adams:

 Of course I do. How could I not recognise Mr Blackbeard?

Adams begins straightening the teddy bear's clothing.

Easton:

 Please describe how you know the bear.

Adams:

 I got him as a kid. I won him from a raffle just before school let out. He kept me company all summer break. But … I lost him. Someone stole him from me at the park. He was there on the swings, and then he wasn't. I looked all over for him, even got my grandma to help. But we never found him.

Easton:

 Do you recognise the other toys on the shelf?

Adams:

 Yeah, I got them both for Christmas I think. I dunno what happened to them. I think I lost them when we moved in 1999.

Easton:

 Thank you. Please place the toy back on the shelf.

Adams:

 There is something that I don't get. SCP-8104 only generates lost toys, right?

Easton:

 Testing so far has suggested that's the case.

Adams:

 Then why has it generated Mr Blackbeard? I lost him, but only for a few weeks. My mum found him and gave him back to me. I still remember her standing outside the school gates with him in her arms and a goofy smile on her face.

Researcher Adams places the bear back onto SCP-8104.

Adams:

 Sorry, do you mind if I step out and make a quick call?

Easton:

 Please do.

Researcher Adams exits Research Lab 13.

[END LOG]

Additional Notes:

 Researcher Adams later confirmed that his mother had not found the original Mr Blackbeard. Upon questioning, she revealed she had bought a new bear and used a combination of dirt, mud and aggressive stomping to make the bear appear used. Researcher Adams has submitted a request to keep the version of Mr Blackbeard produced by SCP-8104. This request has been approved.

Easton:

 Is there really no-one else available?

Rosen:

 Unfortunately, yes. The flu has been going around the Site, and everyone who volunteered is too sick to participate. I’d volunteer, but I’ve already been in a test. Isn’t that right Bibbles?

Junior Researcher Rosen picks up a plastic black cat figurine. She then begins to speak through the figurine with a squeaky voice.

Rosen:

 That’s right Rosey.

Easton:

 Really Rosen?

Junior Researcher Rosen panics and quickly puts down the figurine.

Rosen:

 Sorry, I just can’t help it. Even since I got this back I just get the urge to speak through it like my Dad did.

Easton:

 It’s fine, but we should get started. Just remember to note that I’ve replaced the volunteers we had on the list for today.

Junior Researcher Rosen nods.

Rosen:

 I'm ready when you are.

Researcher Easton touches SCP-8104. It generates one Treasure Troll dressed as a surgeon with blue, spiked hair going through its surgical cap. Researcher Easton picks up the toy and stares at it. She does not move for two minutes.

Rosen:

 Is everything alright? Do I need to call someone?

Researcher Easton wipes her eyes with her hand. She then places the toy back on the shelf.

Easton:

 No, sorry. I was just lost in my thoughts. Anyway, this is a Treasure Troll that was gifted to me by my parents. I lost it during the bushfires in 1993.

Rosen:

 I'm so sor—

Easton:

 Don't worry it's fine. Make sure to properly document everything. I have some work elsewhere, so please excuse me.

 Researcher Rodriguez and Researcher Miller

[BEGIN LOG]

Researcher Rodriguez and Researcher Miller enter Research Lab 13.

Rodriguez:

 You're sure you had one?

Miller:

 Sure? How could I not be sure? Finding it was, like, the third-best thing that ever happened to me. It was all I talked about for a month. Probably why it ended up getting stolen.

Rodriguez:

 I admit you have been unusually excited ever since you got approval. But I remain sceptical. I just can't believe you managed to get one.

Miller:

 Be prepared to be proven wrong, nonbeliever.

Rodriguez:

 We'll see.

The 2 researchers approach SCP-8104. Researcher Rodriguez pulls out a Nintendo Game Boy Advance with a grey, transparent colouring. Inside the console's cartridge port is an unknown, bright orange cartridge. Attached to the console is a cable.

Rodriguez:

 Fire away, Miller.

Researcher Miller touches SCP-8104. Two toys appear on the shelf. The first is a Fit 'n Fun Carebear that is missing both ears and a leg. The second is a bright green Game Boy Advance cartridge. Researcher Rodriguez hands the cartridge to Researcher Miller before picking up the Carebear. Researcher Miller pulls an identical Game Boy Advance from his coat pocket. He inserts the cartridge into the device and turns it on.

Rodriguez:

 Not a fan of Carebears?

Miller:

 Nope. Auntie Helen thought I was though. Got me a new one every Christmas.

Rodriguez:

 Could've been worse, you know? She could've given you socks.

Researcher Rodriguez tosses the Carebear into a nearby trash can. Researcher Miller smiles and turns around his Game Boy Advance.

Miller:

 Here it is. One shiny Entei as promised.

Rodriguez:

 Shit, you weren't lying. How did you of all people get that lucky?

Miller:

 What? Are you calling me unlucky?

Rodriguez:

 We all know you have the worst luck of anyone in the Department. You're famously the only person who hasn't won something at the annual Christmas raffle. And you've worked here for 10 years. Even Claire won, and she's only ever bought one ticket.

Miller:

 We both know I never win because what's his face organises it.

Rodriguez:

 Do you mean Carter?

Miller:

 Is that his name? Dunno how I forgot it. He's been a thorn in my side since I got promoted. It's not my fault Williams recognises greatness when she sees it.

Rodriguez:

 Sure, keep telling yourself that.

Miller:

 Whatever. Have you got what I asked for?

Rodriguez:

 Yeah the Legos have been ordered. Should be with you by the end of next week.

Miller:

 Sweet. Let's get trading.

Both researchers exit Research Lab 13.

Present:

 Researcher Cassandra Easton, Doctor Henry Easton and Oliver Easton

Additional Notes:

 The following footage was retrieved from Research Cassandra Easton's phone. An hour of irrelevant footage has been removed. For clarity, first names have been used in this log.

[BEGIN LOG]

Cassandra connects her phone to a charging station placed in the hotel's kitchenette. She then walks over to Henry, who is watching their son Oliver sleep on a nearby lounge.

Henry:

 Look at him. It's just past 3, and he's already exhausted.

Cassandra:

 Do you think the petting zoo was a little much?

Henry laughs

Henry:

 Nah, if anything, that'll be the highlight of the trip for him. We best be prepared for him to keep asking to have a petting zoo at his birthday party.

Cassandra:

 I don't think getting one would be too hard, would it? I know the daycare had one for a fundraiser sometime last year. We could ask them for the details of whoever they used.

Henry:

 Sounds like a plan. We can ask them when we get back.

The two are silent for 37 seconds. During that time, Cassanda being fidgeting with her jacket's zipper.

Cassandra:

 A petting zoo is fine, sure. But I was thinking of getting him something extra special.

Henry walks over to the kitchenette and pulls a water bottle from the mini fridge. Cassandra follows him.

Henry:

 What do you mean by special?

Cassandra:

 Ok, hear me out. You know the project I've been assigned to at work? I was thinking of using it to get something from my past to give to Oliver, kinda like a family heirloom.

Henry:

 I dunno, Cass. I know your project isn't shaping up to be anything major, but you never know with things like this. And I'd rather be safe and keep anything work related away from Oliver.

Cassandra:

 I agree that work and Oliver shouldn't mix, but I promise you, this is safe. Everyone's been using it for weeks now, and the worst thing that happened was someone tripping on loose marbles.

Henry:

 Why don't we buy another one or get something similar made? It'll be just as good as the real thing was.

Cassandra:

 But it's not the real thing, Henry. When I held that doll in my hand, I knew it was the one I lost.

Henry sighs. Oliver is seen awakening and climbing down from the lounge. Neither of his parents notice.

Henry:

 Look, I won't say no, but just be careful, please? For my sake and Oliver's.

Cassandra:

 I will. You have my word.

Cassandra and Henry kiss as Oliver walks over to them.

Oliver:

 Mum, Dad?

Cassandra and Henry walk over to Oliver and kneel in front of him.

Henry:

 Did you have a bad dream again, Henry?

Oliver sniffles.

Oliver:

 Y…Yeah. I dreamed that I went looking for mummy and I couldn't find her.

Cassandra:

 Aww honey, it's ok.

Cassandra hugs Oliver, who reciprocates

Cassandra:

 I promise mummy isn't going anywhere, ok?

Oliver:

 You promise?

Cassandra:

 I promise, now and forever.

Oliver sniffles again.

Oliver:

 I still feel a little sad. Can we go get some ice cream?

Cassandra:

 I'd like some, too. Why don't you ask your Dad and see if he'd like to come with us?

Oliver looks up at his father.

Oliver:

 Please, please, please! I won't give it to the fishes like last time.

Henry:

 How can I refuse my little man? Let's get going.

Oliver:

 Yay! Let me up, let me up.

Henry:

 Hop up, little man!

Henry helps Oliver onto his shoulders, and the two go out of view as Oliver plays with Henry's hair. Cassandra walks over and picks up her phone, removing it from the charging station.

Cassandra:

 Wait, is this still re—

Addendum 8104.5: Scans of Researcher Cassandra Easton's Diary Entries

Friday 10 November 2023

Is it wrong for a researcher to be annoyed when their inbox is full? I mean, I know that I can't ever expect an empty inbox. I still remember when I was being recruited, and I asked what the workload was like. The guy laughed and said I'd get used to it. And he was right. I did get use to the bombardment after a while.

 

But ever since I was put in charge of the SCP-8104 usage request forms, it's been insane. Everyday I walk in and find at least 20 emails asking to use it. It's even starting to reach other sites. Just today I found 3 different requests from Site-19 and another 2 from Site-76. Each of them claim they need to travel and 'just happen' to be detouring through Site-83. I feel like it's only a matter of time before an O5 turns up. And I don't know if I can take that level of pressure.

 

Truthfully though, I'm not upset by all the requests, even if I complain a bit. I asked to take this on because I saw the reactions during testing. The joy, the smiles and laughter. Most of the people working here have seen truly horrific things. I can't fix that, it's a part of the job. But I can give them a glimpse back into simpler times. And that's worth something, even if people are going a little bit overboard.

 

There is something else, though. I've been wanting to use it again. When I first used it and it made the Troll, I was shell-shocked. I've spent weeks of my life trying to hold onto the memory of my parents, of our home and the gifts they gave me. But the more I try, the more it's wrong. Parts go missing, or change and change again. The more I walk away from those times, the more they fade away. I don't want them to fade, but it won't ever stop, will it? But maybe the shelf can help.

 

I think I'll give using it another go. I just want a few more things that won't disappear. And if anything, I'll get a few things I can give to Oliver for his 5th birthday. Some mementos passed down to me, and soon to him. I know Henry has said he's not happy with the idea. Is it wrong if I think he's being too cautious? Making one toy won't hurt anyone. But I will be careful with it. I am a woman of my word after all.

Tuesday 14 November 2023

So, after a week of containment breaches, new intakes and power outage I was finally able to get some alone time with SCP-8104. I kind of knew today was the day. I was on edge since I walked through the door. I couldn't concentrate on anything, no matter how much I tried. I think it's because I was excited, even if I didn't want to admit it to myself. And you know what? I had every reason to be.

 

I used it once and I got 5 toys! 5! Well, I suppose if you consider a Matryoshka doll as five, but still. I know that might not seem like a lot, but I saw them and I remembered things. I could see our living room again, and I remembered how I would sneak out there and play on hot summer nights. I remembered how my dad bought it over to me one day. He told me he was a wizard and he'd made me a special toy. Oh, how I giggled when he pulled out one doll after another. That day was a precious one.

 

I was thinking about it before, but now I've made up my mind. I'm going to write up a list of every toy my parents ever got me. It won't be a short list, after all mum and dad bought me a few things every time they travelled for work. But I don't mind. Even if it takes a few weeks, months or even years, it'll be worth every second. This is the closest I've felt to my parents in decades, and I'm not going to lose that.

 

Wish me luck!

Toy List: 34 out of 105

 

The toy list is off to a strong start. I've been using SCP-8104 as often as I can and it has proven productive. I've been staying on-site so I have more opportunities to use it alone. It's not that I don't trust the others, it's just hard. I can tell when I look at them that they have questions about my past. But I'm just not wanting to talk about it. It hurts every time I think about that final time I saw them. Driving away in the back of my uncles car as they waved at me, hoses in hand and an orange red sky looming above. Hell, it was hard enough telling Henry, and he's the one person I trust more than anyone else.

 

But when I'm alone, I don't have to worry about questions. I can sit with the toys and remember my childhood before it was taken away from me. The smells, the happiness and the innocence. It's all mine without the worried eyes and unspoken questions. Is it so wrong to want to indulge in what I lost and have once again found?

 

I think I need to start dialling it back a bit, though. I've let a few tasks slip through over the last few weeks. I guess my mind has just been on the list and my parents. I'm hoping I'll have the list finished soon. I want to show Oliver and Henry everything so badly. And I think it'd be cute to take some photos of Oliver with some of the softer toys. He'll be out of his crib soon, so I want to get them while I can.

 

Friday 9 December 2023

Toy List: 78 out of 105

 

Today has been one of those days. When I walked into the lab, I just knew something was going to be thrown my way. I tried to avoid it by doing paperwork (note to self: need a new way to keep track of tasks. Got another complain from the Site Director. Sticky notes maybe?) but it still found me. And its name was Junior Researcher Rosen.

 

Trust me, I know what it's like being new. It's overwhelming, exhausting, world-breaking and confusing. A 1000 things at once that turn even the best person into a headless chicken. But you need to stick with your assigned team. So, tell me why she keeps coming into my office with questions! I was trying to do some work and in she comes. Asks me about some project she's working on. I had to spend 20 minutes going over it with her before she seemed satisfied. And that happened three times today alone.

 

I might ask around to see who her assigned team is. I might feel better having a few choice words with them.

 

Wednesday 13 December 2023

Toy List: 104 out of 105

 

We're almost there! Just one more toy and my list is done. You'd figure this would be a happy moment, but I can't feel anything beside annoyance. I've been at 104 since Saturday. Yet no matter how much I try, I can't get that final Koala plush. I remember the thing, I bought it for a dollar at a garage sale. I know I left it at home that day. Yet it just won't show up. It's so, so frustrating! And even worse, the janitor complained about all the toys being thrown out. He's just being dramatic. We both know I haven't used it that much.

 

But today has had one silver lining. Henry came and saw me, and he bought some chocolates too. He said he was worried about me and asked me to come home for a few days. He's such a sweetie. I guess it's true I've been sleeping on-site for a while now. It would be good to go home and sleep in my own bed for once.

 

Maybe we could go out on a date too? I've been thinking of a few places we might go. It's been a while since the wedding, so I'd like to finally be able to say we've gone on our first post-wedding date. Guess I'll see how he's feeling when I get back.

Additional Notes:

 Researcher Cassandra Easton was later found by Foundation agents and taken to Site-83 for assessment. It was determined by Head Psychologist Robert Yaskin that Researcher Easton had lost a significant number of memories from after she turned 13, including all memories of her son Oliver Easton. Interviews with staff who used SCP-8104 showed similar, but less significant, memory loss. Further testing was conducted which revealed that SCP-8104 consumes memories in exchange for the toys it produces. There is currently no known method for those affected to regain memories taken by SCP-8104.

 The Truth

Dear Robert,

You told me during our last session that you felt I was holding back, and that I wasn't being truthful with you or Cassandra. You're not going to be surprised when I tell you that you weren't wrong. I have been holding back, because it’s the final thing I can do to try and keep my family together.

My life has become a series of lies. Everyday, I tell my wife and son a hundred different lies. I tell Oliver that his mother is just sick and that she'll be all better soon. I tell him that we're still going to Disney this year. And I tell him that she still loves him.

I tell my wife that I’m not angry with her, and that I understand why she chose toys over us and so quickly destroyed everything we built for wood and plastic. I tell her colleagues I'm not angry with them for allowing that thing to be used to freely, and not testing it properly. I tell myself I'm not just as guilty as everyone else for not firmly telling her to never use the stupid thing.

My wife, for all intents and purposes, has died. The history we shared, no matter how good or bad, is gone from her mind. And there is no way to get that back. She is no longer the Cassandra I married, she is another person entirely. There is no love or support or counselling that is going to change that. She needs to want to change, and I don't think she wants to. And I cannot say for certain if I can stay married to her knowing this.

In sum, I am surrounded by helpful people, yet I am the loneliest I have ever been.

 Request for Session Cancellations

Hello Robert,

I would like to formally request an end to all sessions, single and with Henry moving forward. I have already spoken with the Site Director, and they've agreed, but they've left the final signoff with you. I know you might be hesitant, so I've decided to put everything on the table, in the hopes of convincing you it's the right choice.

I've not told anyone except Henry this before, but I lost my parents in 1993, when I was 12. It was a few weeks before Christmas, and there was a huge bushfire heading toward our property on Sydney’s outskirts. There were reports coming in that these fires were the worst in a decade, and people needed to leave while they had the chance. My parents were stubborn though. They thought that hoses and sprinklers could keep our home safe.

The only reason I wasn't there that day was because my uncle convinced my parents to let me evacuate with him. I remember sitting in the back of his car and watching my parents wave at me. They smiled and yelled not to worry, and that we'd be together soon. I wish that was all I could remember of that day. But I can still see the orange sky and the red sun. I can see the burnt leaves falling from the sky, and the smoke that made it difficult to breathe.

It was a month later when I was allowed to return home, if you can call it that. A pile of ash and melted metal isn't much of a home, is it? I remember looking for my parents. I hoped they'd found a place to hide and were just waiting for me to find them. I looked everywhere, I even had my uncle help. But they weren't there anymore.

It was hard moving forward after that. My childhood had ended in one day, and while my uncle tried, I couldn't get it back. And that fact has stayed with me my entire life.

So, can you blame me when I took the chance I did? It was the only way for me to get back the childhood I lost. And, I can honestly say I don't regret what I did. Because what I got back wasn’t just gifts from my parents, but the memories they bought back with them.

I know it's hard for Henry right now. But I think given time, we can make it work. I'm not the Cassandra Easton he knows, but I can be a Cassandra Easton he can love just as much.

As for Oliver, I don't know what I'm going to do. I don't hate him, but I also don't know him. I feel nothing when I look at him or talk about him. Henry sent me videos of us on vacation and I was blank. I'll try, I promised Henry as much. But there that's all I can do.

I hope this email is enough to convince you. I look forward to your reply.

Regards,

Researcher Cassandra Easton

Addendum 8104.7: Updated Special Containment Procedures

Access to SCP-8104 for all staff has been revoked, and it will be moved into secure storage. Further review into the Special Containment Procedures of SCP-8104 is ongoing.
