SCP-3057-1.

Item #:

 SCP-3057

Object Class:

 Keter

Special Containment Procedures:

 A small quantity of SCP-3057-1 is contained on-site. Members of MTF Epsilon-6 ("Oil Slickers") are to operate as first-responders in the event of a major oil spill, destroying all organisms produced via SCP-3057.

Description:

 SCP-3057 is an anomalous phenomenon by which crude oil spontaneously transforms into instances of prehistoric species (SCP-3057-1 and onward).

SCP-3057-1

1

 was first observed in the aftermath of the 

Deepwater Horizon

 explosion

2

 in 2010. PoI-8A052 (an ex-employee of the 

Manna Charitable Foundation

) deployed SCP-3057 in an attempt to reverse environmental damage caused by the disaster. It was only through extensive Foundation efforts that SCP-3057-1's spread was limited to a radius of 0.25 kilometers from the initial point of contamination. Since 2010, 4 more instances of SCP-3057 have been observed around the world. Whether this is a result of the initial contamination remains unknown.

The Manna Charitable Foundation has disavowed all knowledge of SCP-3057, and claims PoI-8A052's employment was terminated several weeks before the 

Deepwater Horizon

 incident. An ongoing investigation is underway to determine whether or not this is true.

It is suspected, but not confirmed, that 

SCP-2113

 is the result of SCP-3057.

SCP-3057-2.

Date:

 08/11/2013

Location:

 Philippines; Estancia, Iloilo

Description:

 SCP-3057-2; 

Anomalocaris

, a Cambrian era meter-long ancestral arthropod resembling predatory shrimp.

Notes:

 

Power Barge 103

 (owned by Napocor, or National Power Company) experienced several leaks as a result of Typhoon Haiyan. This resulted in the emergence of several hundred instances of SCP-3057-2.

Over a dozen injuries along the coast have been linked to SCP-3057-2, which attacks its prey using barbs lining 2 appendages located near its mouth. These attacks have been blamed on a new species of invasive jellyfish. Foundation efforts to destroy all instances of SCP-3057-2 are ongoing.

SCP-3057-3.

Date:

 09/12/2014

Location:

 Bangladesh; Sundarbans, Khulna Division

Description:

 SCP-3057-3; 

Meganeura

, a Carboniferous era dragonfly with a maximum wingspan of 0.65 meters.

3

Notes:

 The 

OT Southern Star 7

 collided with a cargo vessel, leading to several hundred instances of SCP-3057-3.

Every instance of SCP-3057-3 expired shortly after manifesting; recent research suggests this is related to SCP-3057-3 having evolved in an oxygen-rich environment.

4

 All SCP-3057-3 instances have been recovered and destroyed.

Aftermath of SCP-3057-4 emergence.

Date:

 03/05/2015

Location:

 United States of America; Pennsylvania, Philadelphia

Description:

 SCP-3057-4; 

Velociraptor

, a Cretaceous era carnivorous theropod dinosaur approximately 2 meters in length and 0.5 meters high (at the hip).

Notes:

 A unit upset in an oil refinery caused several vessels in a tank-farm to catastrophically rupture. This led to the emergence of several dozen instances of SCP-3057-4. All instances are believed to have fled into the surrounding wetlands.

5

To date, 11 casualties (9 injuries and 2 fatalities) have been linked to SCP-3057-4. Foundation operatives have provided media outlets with a false cover story describing the escape of several cassowaries from captivity. All efforts to destroy instances of SCP-3057-4 are to be conducted by MTF Phi-2 ("Clever Girls").

SCP-3057-5.

Date:

 28/01/2017

Location:

 India; Chennai, Ennore Port

Description:

 SCP-3057-5; 

Megalodon

, a Cenozoic era shark with a maximum length of 18 meters.

6

Notes:

 The 

BW Maple

 collided with 

Dawn Kanchipuram

, another oil-tanker. This lead to the manifestation of 6 instances of SCP-3057-5.

1 instance of SCP-3057-5 is confirmed as destroyed; the remaining 5 instances remain unaccounted for. After the loss of 

Beagle 2

's crew, all further efforts to destroy instances of SCP-3057-5 are now conducted by MTF Theta-5 ("The Bigger Boat").

Interviewed:

 PoI-8A051

Interviewer:

 Agent Densworth

Foreword:

 PoI-8A051 is an ex-employee of the Manna Charitable Foundation, and was involved in the 

Deepwater Horizon

 incident.

<Begin Log.>

Agent Densworth:

 How did you do this? Was it a chemical?

PoI-8A051:

 The 'how' isn't as important as the 'why'.

Agent Densworth:

 Alright, I'll bite: Why did you decide to turn one ecological disaster into a much bigger one?

PoI-8A051:

 Really? You think a prehistoric algae bloom is worse than dumping five million barrels of poison into the ocean?

Agent Densworth:

 You can't pull an extinct species out of the Proterozoic era, hurl it into the modern world, then not expect dire consequences.

PoI-8A051:

 More dire than the consequences of hurling over a billion metric tons of carbon dioxide into our atmosphere every year?

Agent Densworth:

 For fuck's sake. Are you for real?

PoI-8A051:

 You're concerned over some obsolete organisms popping into existence and making life a little more complicated. Meanwhile, I'm concerned over how we are obliviously committed to a campaign to de-terraform the entire fucking planet. Are 

you

 for real?

Agent Densworth:

 I'm not here to argue with your bizarro-world Greenpeace bullshit, Al Gore. I'm here to find out how you did this. And you're not leaving this room until you tell me.

PoI-8A051:

 In that case, I suspect I will be here for quite a while.
