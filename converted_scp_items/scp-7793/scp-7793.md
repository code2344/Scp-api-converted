The tapes are too heavy. The words flood. The paper blurs. You play the first casette:
“Today is the 13th. Yesterday I swear was like normal. I don’t understand anything.”
Finally.
It's quiet and secluded here. Sequestered from the festivals and rituals.
Entrance.
Rusted halls surround you. Your muffled footsteps and gentle creaking, your quiet breath, and idle ambience. There's something you can't remember to remember.
You entwine with the corridors. Touch.
Feel.
Isn't it so wonderful here?
Isn't it domestic here?
Isn't it completely edgeless and devoid of straight lines here?
Ever since you started feeling so out of place in the world, since things became so wrong, like some cool yellow haze.
Like a child woven into the mud. Weaned not on milk. Destitute of relatability. There's something you can't remember to remember.
Belonging is a dull dream. A sugary opiate.
Drawn up inside, withdrawn from people who don't seem so much like the people you learned to live with.
When did it all change?
When were you left behind?
Corrugated steel and decrepit tiles embrace you. It does for you what the sphere does for others. There's something you can't remember to remember.
Suddenly, a cabinet. And a dresser. It's warm and damp here, slathered with the feeling of company. There are dents and torn sheets of corrugated steel, but you feel at peace here regardless. It's quiet, it's simple. It's away.
Inhale.
Exhale.
There's a bulky envelope resting on the cabinet. Beside it is a vintage recorder with a cassette still inside.
There's something you can't remember to remember.

There's something you can't remember to remember.
You push it in.

> That's what's written down. It's a mess, isn't it? I mean, fuck.
> You know, it was crazy watching everything switch all of a sudden. Batshit fucking crazy.
> Everything suddenly meant a new thing, and the old everything was nothing, and nothing was everything. Everything changed to match now. My brain hurts just fucking thinking about it.
> And then there's me. And probably a few others. I'm nothing, less than nothing. A something that was left behind when everything become nothing and nothing became everything.
> That mess there is what's real. They don't see it like that. They don't see how messed up everything is. Once it came, everything changed.
> I liked my job, I liked my job, fuck I liked my job. It's like, how do I say it? Fuck, I can't think straight. Hold on, I need to…
> Okay
> Okay
> This area is
> It knows we lingered, it does. Everyone else goes about their lives, seeing their purposes as natural, but we, we're the ones that know.
> Like Jason said that one time, we are, fuck, we are burdened! Burdened with the truth. I've got this recorder here. And this notebook, so I can write shit down. But I can tell you everything started with that sphere.
> that stupid fucking thing
> they should've left it where they found it
> But!
> But,
> You may find me buried in some ruined facility but you will find this alive and well in a parcel, taped to the files. I'm not a lunatic. They'll erase my body, make me nothing but something that was never anything.
> They isn't the right word. I'm not making sense. This is it Winnie, you've finally lost it. Lost your articulation. Running for so long will do that.
> I watched my whole world change and here I am, stuck in an existence that doesn't exist anymore. I can't see things the way they do anymore. I lived in a universe created in our image, and I saw that universe recreated in something else's image.
> They will never really know the world they live in like we do.
> We're the only ones that know
> I
> I don't have much time left, do I?
> I mean, I knew it would end eventually.
> I knew my luck would run out eventually.
> But.
> Is this really all there is?
> I spend my last moments as an extant concept pooled in some corridor.
> Alone?
> I have to sit and wait for it to come and find me..?
> That's all I get?
> Fuck.
> I can hear it coming.
> Slowly coming.
> It's getting faster now.
