**Special Containment Procedures:** The temple that SCP-5446 was discovered in has been converted into Undersea Area-58. The object itself is contained in a secure item vault, and is only to be utilized by trained medical personnel located on-site.
All individuals recruited for Area-58 management or SCP-3932[1](javascript:;) recontainment efforts must consent to SCP-5446 application. Prior to this, they are to be supplied with scuba gear so they are able to navigate the facility without drowning.

Area-58 Director Gabriel Himes.
**Description:** SCP-5446 is a metallic amulet, believed to have been produced around six thousand years ago.
When applied to a human subject submerged in salt water, the anomaly converts them into an SCP-5446-Δ instance. These are sapient, telepathic jellyfish, superficially similar to the lion's mane jellyfish (_Cyanea capillata_), with tentacles ranging from 24 to 31 meters in length. Individuals transformed this way retain their intelligence and memories, and are able to make use of electric thaumaturgy for combat, communication, and interfacing with Area-58's computer systems.
Originally SCP-5446 was held in a Site-19 locker before being requisitioned to produce sea-based security personnel who would be capable of directly attacking [SCP-3932-Δ](/scp-3932) instances. Previous efforts involving specialized diving equipment proved too expensive and cumbersome, as SCP-3932-Δ instances would easily outmaneuver personnel or sabotage their oxygen tanks.

**Addendum 5446-2:** Containment Update
On 2021/01/02 around 03:15 AM local time, an insurgent cell of Area-58 personnel staged an attack on the facility. Utilizing their anomalous capabilities, they debilitated loyal personnel via psychic assault, and unsealed Area-58's primary entrance to the open sea.
A large number of hostile SCP-3932-Δ and SCP-5446-Δ instances then swarmed the facility. The dolphin combatants deployed previously-unseen paraweaponry capable of shrinking personnel, permitting them to be consumed.[2](javascript:;) The operatives then opened SCP-5446's containment chamber and breached the anomaly. To date, it has not yet been recovered.
All Foundation facilities have been informed to be on alert for attacks by Chaos Insurgency agents who are telepathic jellyfish.
