Preview of SCP-8690 as displayed on major online video sharing platforms.
**Special Containment Procedures:** METATRON.aic must be used to monitor social media and online video sharing platforms for the detection and removal of any copy of SCP-8690.

The audio track is composed of a series of songs related to the musical genre known as Vaporwave[2](javascript:;) repeated several times throughout the video.

Any SCP-8690 copy uploaded online, regardless of site, will be uploaded through a channel or profile bearing the name ["VKTM-core"](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/vikander-kneed-technical-media-hub).

> Vikander-Kneed Technical Media: a Good Past, an even Better Tomorrow™!

If any of the audio tracks are listened to, the victim will experience a deep state of anxiety and anguish related to dramatic events that occurred between January 1, 1990 and December 31, 1999. Although the events may vary depending on the age and nationality of the listener, it has been found that the majority are linked to events that occurred in the United States and/or have had strong media coverage.
**Addendum-8690:** By further analysing the audio tracks, in particular by playing the song backwards, it was possible to find messages contained within the various songs.

> **Audio Message - 1 (00:05)**
> If you're listening to this song normally, welcome to this magical journey into Nostalgia!
> If you're playing with audio files, put your hands to yourself, dirty little man!
> **Audio Message - 2 (01:49)**
> Yeah, yeah, I know that satanic panic and backwards songs are more 80s, but after all that series about kids on bikes with synths in the background, who could tell the difference? You just want the vibes.
> **Audio Message - 3 (03:49)**
> Tell me the truth, you don't give a damn about the 90s, do you?
> You were born in 2003, what could you possibly miss about those years?
> Do you know what happened?
> **Audio Message - 4 (14:22)**
> People were dying then. Tragedies were happening. Like before. Like after.
> But you just want to remember what it was like to not have to think about taxes and your job, when all that mattered was watching cartoons and hoping that the alternative girl in your classroom who sat two rows ahead of you would one day talk to you?
> Huh? Did I guess right?
