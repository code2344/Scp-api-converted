`**ADDENDUM 5759/3:** SCP-5759 Instances`
* * *
Prior to the integration of SCP-5759 into Foundation operations, several instances of SCP-5759 had been registered.  
A log of these has been provided below.  
It is noteworthy that there is no further evidence of these anomalies ever existing.
**OCCUPIED FILE** | **OBJECT CLASS**  
---|---  
SCP-████ | Euclid  
**DESCRIPTION**  
SCP-████ refers to a predatory creature that inhabits reflective surfaces. When someone comes into contact with the surface, SCP-████ will lunge out of the surface and pull the victim into it. SCP-████ has been observed to remain outside of the surface after an attack.  
  
**OCCUPIED FILE** | **OBJECT CLASS**  
---|---  
SCP-███ | Keter  
**DESCRIPTION**  
SCP-███ refers to a vaguely reptilian creature of unknown origin that possesses extreme intelligence and an immense hatred for all lifeforms.  
  
**OCCUPIED FILE** | **OBJECT CLASS**  
---|---  
SCP-████ | Safe  
**DESCRIPTION**  
SCP-████ refers to a series of 18th-century paintings depicting a woman in black attire. This woman is represented in a variety of situations, such as in a household or in an apocalyptic landscape. A connection between these scenes and anomalous occurrences has been found.

`**ADDENDUM 5759/4:** Project Proposal`
* * *
**PROJECT VISHAAK**  
**Research Team:** _Surrealistic Dept. — Site-██_  
**Project Date:** ██/█/████  
  
**Proposal Statement:**  
_To create a medium by which to cloak the Foundation._
* * *
**REQUESTED RESOURCES:**
**Name/Designation** | **Synopsis** | **Access Type/s** | **Justification**  
---|---|---|---  
SCP-5759 | A series of entries on the **SCiPNet** database that anomalously appeared on █/██/████. | Access to all documentation; use of anomaly; use of database slot "SCP-5759". | Anomaly could be modified for the purpose of **PROJECT VISHAAK**.  
~15% of the Dept. Of Surrealistics | N/A | Use of personnel. | Proposal requires large amounts of manpower, and due to the Proposal at hand, Dept. Of Surrealistics is the most appropriately suited for it.  
~1% of the Dept. Of Infotech | N/A | Use of resources and personnel. | Due to the existence of the project within the database, several members of Infotech are required.  
[SCP-6579](http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6579) | A phenomenon that kills anyone who views Dr. Cambridge, or spends a significant amount of time observing his office. | Use of anomaly. | `[REDACTED]`  
* * *
**PROJECT DETAILS:**
**PROJECT VISHAAK** involves the modification of SCP-5759 to allow for `[DATA EXPUNGED]`.  
As such, it is requested that any and all information regarding it be classified at **LEVEL-5 (TOP SECRET)** and **LEVEL-6 (COSMIC TOP SECRET)** clearances.
Personnel are requested to have knowledge of Surrealistics, Infotech, and Temporal Anomalies.
The objective of the project consists of setting up "dummy files" through the **SCiPNet** database, utilizing files that are already unusable, to avoid classified information from being leaked into the public/GoIs.

_`You take the fishhook and fondly regard its sharpness. The drive with which it expresses its nature. If only you could achieve such a pinnacle. You prick your thumb against it. The drop of blood is perfect in the same way the fishhook is. The hook exists to snare. The blood exists to bleed. If only you had such purpose.`_

The goal of **PROJECT VISHAAK** was, as you may know, _"To create a medium by which to cloak the Foundation"_.
This was achieved by the use of SCP-5759 — and several other anomalies — and the modification of several unusable files on the **SCiPNet** database that modified any and all text inputted into them, distorting the reader's experience and making it an endless spiral towards a conclusion that is never reached.
I doubt you need me to elaborate more, further information will be given to those members of the **OVERSEER COUNCIL** that request it.

_**THE DESIGNER** — We've got an intruder in the database._
_**THE FIRST** — Hm… What files have been breached?_
_**THE DESIGNER** — SCP-5759, so it's no problem._
_**THE FIRST** — What iteration, then?_
_**THE DESIGNER** — Real one, actually. Hilarious, if you ask me. At least this one will know what's happening when they're looped._
_**THE FIRST** — We can laugh about that tonight._
