SCP-6356's place of discovery.
**Item #:** SCP-6356
**Object Class:** Euclid
**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-6356 is contained in a standard Bio-hazard containment cell at Site-315. Maintenance activities, involving three D-Class personnel in hazmat suits, are scheduled biweekly for cleaning purposes.
**Description:** SCP-6356 is a large, vaguely spherical amalgamation of organs, bones, and flesh approximately 3 meters in height. SCP-6356 appears to be sentient, frequently moaning in apparent pain. SCP-6356's only discernible, fully functioning organ is a phallus.
SCP-6356 occasionally speaks through unknown means in a masculine voice, often followed by sobbing. It appears to not respond to outside stimuli. While communicating, SCP-6356 exudes a thick fluid composed out of blood and semen.
SCP-6356 was originally discovered in the personal room of ███ Greenfield, currently aged 25.[1](javascript:;) She reported it appearing within her closet, sobbing and covering her clothing in a variety of bodily fluids.
Since initial containment, SCP-6356 has been repeating only the following line, interjected with sobbing:
> I won't ever be her. I'm sorry.
