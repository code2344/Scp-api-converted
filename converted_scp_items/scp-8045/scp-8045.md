SCP-8045
**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-8045 is to be contained in a standard low-risk anomalous containment locker at Site-19. Access to SCP-8045 requires Level 2 clearance. Testing involving SCP-8045 must be conducted in a controlled environment with surveillance cameras monitoring the testing area. No anomalous items (including other SCP objects) or sentient creatures are to be left underneath SCP-8045 overnight.
**Description:** SCP-8045 is a standard-sized 51 cm. x 56 cm. goose down feather pillow, with no discernible manufacturer's label or markings. The pillow is composed of ordinary materials consistent with those found in non-anomalous pillows.
SCP-8045 exhibits its anomalous properties at night[1](javascript:;) when placed on a bed[2](javascript:;) with an item left underneath the pillow, between itself and the bed. These properties manifest only when all human individuals in direct sightline of the bed are either sleeping in the bed or are otherwise unconscious. If a fully conscious individual is present throughout the entirety of the night, SCP-8045 will not exhibit its anomalous effects.
When these conditions are met, a fairy[3](javascript:;) (labeled SCP-8045-1) corresponding to the specific item type left underneath SCP-8045 will manifest in the room. SCP-8045 consistently summons the exact same SCP-8045-1 instance for any given item. All SCP-8045-1 instances wear miniature nametags identifying them as the fairy of that particular type of item.
The fairy will approach SCP-8045, retrieve the item left underneath it, and subsequently attempt to depart the room by flying away, disappearing shortly thereafter. In exchange for the item, the fairy will leave behind a form of payment; usually (though not exclusively), it will leave behind some kind of currency, most commonly in the form of a single quarter (25¢ USD) coin.
If an SCP-8045-1 instance is interrupted in some manner before it is able to retrieve the item left underneath SCP-8045, it will prematurely disappear. It will attempt to complete its task later in the night when the conditions for its appearance are met once again. Surveillance footage indicates that SCP-8045's effects are not impeded by the presence of cameras.

Subsequently, they engage in a continuous exchange, taking the item left by the other fairy and replacing it with their own, creating an infinite loop.
