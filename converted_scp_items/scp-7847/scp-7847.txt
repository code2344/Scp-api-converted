Item #:

 SCP-7847

Level 3/7847

Object Class:

 Keter

Classified

Special Containment Procedures:

SCP-7847 is to be contained at Site-74 in a standard isolated high-risk humanoid containment chamber. Staff members are not allowed within 30m of SCP-7847's containment wing without prior approval by the Site Director.

All personnel assigned to duties involving SCP-7847 and an unobscured line of sight are to only utilize objects of which they have been in contact with for less than a week, and are explicitly forbidden from using any kind of instrument that predisposes them to a sentimental attachment to said object (i.e. items given to them as presents, as a reward from work, etc.).

Approximation of the mask worn by SCP-7847.

Description:

SCP-7847 is a humanoid entity whose primary anomalous trait is being nearly impervious to any form of physical damage. In conjunction with this, it is highly aggressive and will often attack any nearby living organism, especially other humanoids, using this ability to its advantage to either procure weaponry or bludgeon its target directly. It also attacks anything it observes destroying items of sentimental value to any kind of sapient organism.

The body of SCP-7847 is approximately 2 meters tall and mostly translucent, tinted a dark gray. Observers most often liken the visual texture of its body to that of glass or polished stone, remarking that “something” is moving inside, the origin and properties of which are unknown.

 Attached to SCP-7847 is a mask most closely resembling a Japanese-style 

Onna Noh

 mask—a drawing of this item has been appended to this document. This mask appears to be irremovable from SCP-7847, and all attempts to test its properties have resulted in severe injuries to involved personnel. As of the writing of this document, SCP-7847 does not seem to possess any capacity for verbal communication, either about its motives or its possible emotional state.

Item History:

SCP-7847 was discovered on June 13th, 2024 by Dr. Amagi Seiryuu in Media, Pennsylvania after the Foundation investigated a string of unexplained disposals involving anomalous materials and Japanese artifacts in the town’s local dump. These artifacts’ remnants were traced to a nearby wastewater treatment facility, where it was discovered they matched the missing catalog of the 

Rekihaku

, or the National Museum of Japanese History.

Initially found wedged in an aqueduct, SCP-7847 was assumed to be inanimate and lacking anomalous properties besides that of its appearance. It was quickly separated and stored in a mundane item locker until it was removed for processing at Site-74, at which point someone in the room referred to it as “junk”, and laughed at how “haphazard” it looked.

 At that, it sprung forth and killed the nearby workers; twenty more personnel would be bludgeoned to death before it was finally subdued and current containment procedures were established.

 Discovered Documents

During a follow-up interview regarding the theft of the 

Rekihaku

’s gallery, a link between SCP-7847 and a one “Cherry Blossoms Rise Inc.” was discovered. Two curators were found guilty of delivering the museum’s collection to figures representing the company in exchange for large sums of money. They claimed Cherry Blossoms Rise Inc. posited themselves as a research group studying objects from the Japanese Middle Ages as part of a larger effort to find a recipe for an immortality elixir.

Forensic accounting efforts did not manage to trace this “Cherry Blossoms Rise Inc.” to any real, tangible holders, marking it as a likely shell of another corporation. This was further confirmed by all listed addresses of the company leading to warehouses also filled with anomalous waste material, much of which was unsalvageable.

Based off recovered materials, though, it is theorized that the company was operating as a subsidiary of GoI-012,

 as handwriting samples from papers found match those on file for PoI-012-04.

R&D Strategy Notes (13/02/2023)

Another failure. This is falling into tedium too quickly for my tastes. I am aware that the “autonomous assassin” is a product which has eluded successful development for quite some time despite the simplicity of the concept; even with modern AI technologies, it is unlikely we will see any real progress within the next five years, mirrored further by the many pathetic attempts at such with art and other endeavors in the mundane world.

Everyone wants something different out of that phrase. PENTAGRAM wants the solution to be completely inorganic, citing an unwillingness to keep flesh and tissue alive when the object is not in use, while Valravn and many others insist on a level of improvisation capabilities not easily achievable without keeping the human will intact. It is unfortunately not cost-effective to address both of these problems by their respective lonesomes, as once one group sees desirable traits in a model lacking in theirs, they will demand we port those over even against possible complications. So best to go all in for something to make everyone happy all at once.

We do 

have the raw blueprints

 for these demands, but Mother decided a few months ago it was not practical to tap this reservoir any more. Therefore, it’s fallen onto me to find a substitute—and I was told to leave this to the engineers but if this hasn’t been solved with mortal hands by now, it will most likely never be in a timely fashion.

R&D Strategy Notes (01/04/2023)

Tsukumogami.

 Little Japanese spirits capable of possessing objects when said objects reach a specific age. Took quite some research to find and test these, but they feel like the perfect conduit for my needs, as they do not seem able to make their own decisions while possessing a proximity to humanity that make them likely obedience candidates with a powerful enough magic channel. They also occupy an adjacency to the inorganic, so that would keep the client-side maintenance costs minimal.

Earlier on in my notes I mentioned the “issue” of keeping the human will intact—though we have a few clients who would be okay with their units possessing the ability to freely make their own decisions, this is impractical for both their needs and our production lines. The human will is a predecessor to imperfection, and that imperfection is often found in the margins of decisions made about bloody matters. It is a deluded line of reasoning to believe that souled soldiers will follow orders with the precision needed for the often highly politically motivated assassinations these units would be undertaking. What if one’s wife is the target? Their children? How much money would it cost an organization if one of these assassins got cold feet and fled? What would that say about us for allowing such a problem in our sold product in the first place? The unfortunate truth (for our customers) is that truly unfeeling people are a rarity worth their weight tenfold in diamonds, and that their blunted morals more often land them in finance and management than in murder.

So that leaves us with only one puzzle now: what object to have them possess, and how many spirits I can fit into such. Liquefaction readings confirm that their strength is exponential when multiplied, but since age is a factor in their movement preferences, I am having to run through dozens of historical artifacts in order to perform the tests, and that may not be practical for replacement purposes or possible profit margins…

(I feel like there’s supposed to be a presumed guilt to destroying items so irreplaceable. But why let that matter in the name of progress?)

R&D Strategy Notes (15/04/2023)

Of course the person who wears a mask all the time in the office would suggest a thing. Robert has given me several he obtained as gifts from his business trips to Japan, although my understanding of these creatures put them as not really interested in such young items. That, and these do not fit the specifications within my research—they want tools, because they are manifestations of human use—they want to be seen, they want to be held, and most importantly—they want to be used. 

Want

 to. It is hard-coded into their existence. They must not be denied their usefulness, because such a thing is antithetical to their nascence. (If only the rest of the world could be so lucky as to follow suit.)

Robert’s suggestion does have merit, though. Imbibing invulnerability onto something is an exercise, ironically, of how well it can sustain itself against the initial force of the spell, and such a thing is crucial for autonomous assassination work. That rules out utilizing all but the most well-preserved of teapots, plows, etc, and museums specializing in Japanese history aren’t the cheapest to bribe.

We may need to induce an artificial aging process onto these masks in order to make them suitable habitations for the 

tsukumogami

 on the production scale we’re looking for. Otherwise, these will have to be rented, one-off models.

It is currently unknown by what process PoI-012-04 created SCP-7847. However, thaumic comparative analysis of materials found at the warehouses and SCP-7847’s initial area of discovery suggest the process was violent, wasteful, and deleterious. An estimated 1296 malformed spirit signatures were counted, along with the departed souls of 1133 individuals, all originating from various time periods belonging to the 15th century. Various bookkeeping stub scraps also put the efforts at costing around 300 million USD, with much of this funded from recent tax cut policies applying to businesses GoI-012 invested in within the state of Pennsylvania.

It works. But I cannot stand how empty its face is. It stares at me with no intention where its eyes should be, and the alabaster colour of its cheeks seems to mock my own complexion. When it’s off-duty it stares either at me, an empty window, or small plants we put in the room. Can it think enough to appreciate beauty?

Actually, is it gauche to consider my work art? Perhaps that is not how I actually feel, or how I should consider myself as a 

businesswoman

, but I lack the vocabulary to properly explain what an affront to my pride this thing is. When it stirs, it jerks itself with wanton abandon. When it walks, its legs cycle in opposite directions as if someone is scraping a whisk against a metal bowl. These qualities seem so innate to its emergent design so that I originally thought I failed to give it proper locomotion, but it is actually superior to most of our android blueprints in that department—it predicts with a computer-like precision where it will stumble if it doesn’t correct itself, and can reach top speeds of 80 kilometres as a result.

But none of that erases how 

haphazard

 it looks. How my stomach pushes my mouth to vomit watching it amble. It kills with remarkable precision—but what general trusts a harvestman

8

 with a gun? Who besides the desperate trusts a broken vase to bleed out an attacker?

This will not do. The buyers will not tolerate such malformations, nor its idling machinations (it seems to like watering plants? I didn’t ask it to do that). They aren’t going to put their confidence in a piece of 

junk

 like this.

Everything I suspected has been confirmed. Mother took one look at it and compared it to an aborted fetus. She didn’t even have to touch it like I did to know its internal anatomy.

She offered to dispose of it then and there, but something felt wrong within my chest to just throw it into the fire like that. I told her I could undo its invulnerability myself, and at that she gave me the 

ugliest

 look of disbelief I’ve seen from her in a long time. Or no, maybe it was frustration—or pity—actually, putting it into words, I don’t know what it was. I’d never seen her so repulsed, so maybe I’m just reading too much into what was a simple hatred at something which bothered her. Though could she not have given it that look while 

I

 was in the room?

Whatever the reason, she told me I wouldn’t be able to do it by my lonesome. I asked her what she meant, and she said I had tied it down with magic I didn’t understand. To undo this abomination would require more than my own hand—I still don’t comprehend what she means by that. How can I use magic I’m not capable of understanding? Did I not assemble the legs and arms myself? Who writes a sentence without being able to read it back to their own mind?

No, Mother. I am quite capable of putting this down, thank you. You taught me how to kill, and I will make the action quick, easy and practical.

Mark my words.

 New Behaviors

On November 14th, 2024, employees within Site-74 began to report vocalizations “coming from the walls” and various other soundproofed areas of the facility. Investigation into the situation led to the discovery that SCP-7847 was the source of this phenomenon, upon which a recording station was built at a safe distance from its cell. Transcribed below are the most coherent samples from the recording period, all translated from Japanese. (Note that all ellipses denote when SCP-7847 becomes unintelligible.)

Sing me a song of…

Dancing with flowers, leaves

The bonsai trees

Where

Where

Where…

Into the earth hands writhe

To the body palms break

Along the sea I throw a net

And see the cast treasures once loved

Drown me

Drown me

Drown…

Snip my stem

And fly

11/20/2024

Where

Where…

Cast down

I wish to line teapots

I yearn for building upon…

These concrete walls cradle

A purpose I can only dream of

11/21/2024

Please come back

Come back to me, my meaning

My anatomy

My blueprints

So lovingly screwed in with…

Each tightening like…

My hands break for you

They rot as soil

Sprouts forth onion shoots

11/28/2024

Come back to me, comatose…

Strangled, cherry, bleeding

Sweet fulfillment

Target found

Quota inscribed

I can batter any…

Better than you could

Isn’t this what you made me for?

12/03/2024

Isn’t this what you made me for?

Isn’t this what you made me for?

Isn’t this what you made me for?

You made me

You loved me

You were supposed to…

Supposed to

Supposed to…

Born

Made

Born

Made

Born

Made?

Who creates the bonsai tree?

12/08/2024

If you could not use me

Why didn’t you bury me

Why could you not…

Why couldn’t you…

Why touch me that last time

Why cradle me

Why let your fingers

Grace my face

As your mother glared at me?

I saw more malice within her

Than your pure heart could ever hold

I was a parasite in her eyes

Of your time

And efforts

It should be noted after this vocalization that SCP-7847 attempted a containment breach.

12/12/2024

Stab a sword through

My belly

And hang me upon

A tree…

While the sun

Burns us together

My creator, my creator

Please, use me

Burn upon me

Your instructions

Rend upon my eyes more of

Your desires

You made me such that I do not break

But I think I am falling apart

Without you

This is a failed performance

Of the highest caliber

Is this what I was made for?

Is this what I was made for?

Is this what I was made for?

12/22/2024

Is this what I was made for?

Is this what I was made for?

Is this what I was made for?

Is this what I was made for?

Addendum 03:

 Containment Breach

On 12/29/2024, SCP-7847 successfully breached containment. Thirty personnel were killed as it made its escape from Site-74, with half of these deaths involving blunt force trauma delivered via objects beloved by the victims in some way. The other fifteen casualties were killed by various weapons SCP-7847 managed to disarm from guards and corpses it came across.

SCP-7847 was quickly tracked down by MTF Beta-5 (“Unmaskers”) to the junkyard where it was originally found, having mauled all civilians within a 50m radius. MTF Beta-5 spent two hours attempting to subdue SCP-7847 until the deaths of 80% of the squad resulted in a call for backup, upon SCP-7847 began another vocalization at the top of a trash pile.

This purpose

Is no more

I find no pleasure

In what I do

Your bones breaking

Do not satisfy me

These crushed lungs

Make no joy

So now

I return to rest

So that my body

Unwanted

Unfinished

Unanswered

Is laid to rest

Among the river

Among the stars

Among the grass

All which burned

Brighter than a star

To create me.

I am not old enough

To remember a century

But this body is built

With the money to buy

Enough time to smother

Entire islands

Entire continents

The remains of all homes

Homes where

The dead lay

To you I call

My owner

Who saw me in my infancy

And was supposed to carry me

Until my brittle, breaking end

Will we meet again

Somewhere

Someday?

When you are smiling

When I am walking upright

Put to use

By hands that reach

For your own?

Who desire

Your inventory

As they do their own

Lives?

I miss you, Madam Iris

I miss your everything

I miss your mind

I miss your face

I miss the way your

Satisfaction hung

Like a tree’s swayed canopy

Upon bloody, moneyed arrivals

I am sorry I was not

The tool that you wanted

That you needed

That you desired

I beg of you,

Forgive me.

Forgive me to the depths of the earth

Of which you will rest

Of which we will rest

Forever

Beneath the cherry trees.

Upon finishing this vocalization, the surviving members of Beta-5 reported that SCP-7847 “smoothly” transitioned into a kneeled state, with its hands over its eyes and its chest falling up and down as if it was crying. After approximately five minutes, SCP-7847’s body slowly crumbled, before breaking apart and disintegrating into cherry blossom petals. Only its mask was left behind, with large gashes where its eyes were originally.

With the mask having tested negative for anomalous properties, SCP-7847 is currently pending a reclassification to Neutralized.

Footnotes

1

. This trait is currently unable to be tested due to the threat SCP-7847’s aggression poses towards research equipment.

2

. SCP-7847 is theorized to possess an emotional state based off its behavior at time of discovery combined with its extremely violent reactions to hyper-specific phenomena that indicate it possesses a cognitive awareness of its own self and its surroundings.

3

. It is currently unknown why SCP-7847 reacted the way it did to these words, but observational tests have revealed these two vocal triggers incite levels of aggression within it more extreme than its baseline behavior.

4

. Of note is that three out of the four surveyed sites contained masks of a similar to SCP-7847’s, except burned, broken, marked on with red X’s, or in various states of extremely advanced decay.
