Item #:

 SCP-8993

Object Class:

 Safe

Special Containment Procedures:

 Due to SCP-8993â€™s tendency to shatter when observed, the Department of Unreality may contain SCP-8993 if it so chooses.

Description:

 SCP-8993 is an object which cannot be described visually, due to being mostly invisible, and having an unusual shape. SCP-8993 is often described as "sharp" and "intimidating," however the object is perfectly safe for an observer to approach.

On rare occasions, SCP-8993 will split into two beings, a CORE and a SATELLITE. Due to the fact that the emergence of a SATELLITE is typically violent, the CORE will often be easier to visibly observe, due to its lower body being drenched in liquid. Upon separating itself from the CORE, the SATELLITE will attempt to crawl its way to the stars. When its shape prevents it from doing so, the SATELLITE instance will shatter.

While the SCP-8993 CORE will regain what was lost, it will never regain its shape.
