Special Containment Procedures

All information and documentation regarding SCP-5637 has been digitized and has been stored within the Site-64 secure database. Redundant copies have been backed up to the Site-01 Secure Archive and within Deepwell Catalogues 03 & 17. No further copies should exist outside of these archives. Review of all existent data is limited to Level 4 researchers with a current Grade C Neural Inoculation, and is only available via secured SCiPnet VPN.

Personnel found to be in possession of any additional copies will be subject to immediate demotion and/or termination.

All exploration of SCP-5637 has been terminated as per O5 executive override O5-Ord.2018.0145

Description

SCP-5637-1 image captured from drone footage

SCP-5637 refers 

in toto

 to a parallel reality accessible through an Einstein–Rosen bridge modified to exist within a 3.224-3.286EHz hyperwave band. It is unclear if this reality is a true alternate divergence from/to our own, or exists within a wholly separate universe/dimensional reality.

Several deviations from baseline physical reality have been observed during the course of study, most notably:

Daytime illuminance ranges from 9,000-12,000 Lux on cloudless days, with a pronounced sepia hue.

Baseline Hume levels appear to fluctuate steadily between 0.81 and 0.74

Gravimetric measurements describe a general gravitational pull of 

g

{1.76} or 17.24 m/s².

Local day/night cycle of 29.32 hours

Average surface temperature of 4.6°C, with a range of -7.3:6.8°C. Little to no precipitation.

While no living entities of any kind were noted throughout the observational period, evidence suggests that SCP-5637 once hosted a culture with a technological agency roughly equal to our own. Vast urban complexes and extensive geographical modifications were noted, though in a staggered state of disrepair centering upon the major metropolitan areas.

Due to the relative stability of the Hume fluctuation, lack of inclement weather, and no observed microbial life, entropic evidence is scarce, which makes it exceptionally difficult to hypothesize when SCP-5637 was abandoned. Various theories have been postulated, but with little evidentiary support.

Three major urban areas were extensively explored throughout the duration of the observational period: SCP-5637-1 denotes the area observed during the first opening of the Einstein-Rosen bridge, with SCP-5637-2 & -3 discovered later.

Discovery

SCP-5637 was discovered during Phase II of the 

Post SCP-2935

 Survey conducted by the 

Department of Extra-Universal Affairs

 in early 2017. Originally catalogued as another reality affected by the same anomaly as SCP-2935, the unique attributes of SCP-5637 were discovered upon review of the survey data by Dr. Jasmine Ephraim.

The remainder of this catalogue has been amalgamated from the copious notes and recordings of Dr. Ephraim's exploration of SCP-5637.

RE:

 Phase II survey data

Trevor,

I've come across some variant readings from the E-R Bridge data and I'm pretty certain that it showcases an entirely different universe from the one shown in 2935. The Hume fluctuations of E-R1856 alone are radically different from the baseline we've established for most of "our" corresponding realities, not to mention certain other factors.

I'd like to go ahead and run a series of drone explorations into E-R1856 to confirm my suspicions that it is indeed separate. We have several drones already assigned to my department for cases like this, so there shouldn't be any budgetary overruns from my request. Just an hour or so worth of cycle time on the B-C

1

 and a bit more flight time on the drone itself.

Thanks,

Jaz

Research Subject:

 

E-R1865

 SCP-5637

Foreword:

 

The visual feed from Drone SCPD-0278 has been omitted per O5-Ord.2018.0145. The following log includes Dr. Ephraim's recorded notes only.

[BEGIN LOG]

14:21 -

 It's, uh… 14:20-ish in the afternoon on May 7

th

, 2017. This is Dr. Jasmine Ephraim, establishing the Einstein-Rosen Bridge to E-R1865… now. As per usual, the event horizon of the E-R bridge is heavily occluded by the warping of the C-B generator. Launching drone, uh, 278 into the horizon.

14:26 -

 Getting telemetry back from the drone, everything seems to be working fine. I've got a solid visual feed from all three of the drone's cameras, and all of the on-board sensors are working fine. The Hume field's at 0.74, so a bit lower than our baseline. Temp is registering at 2.9°C, so bring your parkas. Wind is 1.2 meters per second, perfect drone weather. Taking her up.

14:27 -

 If the local sun wasn't just past zenith, I'd have sworn it was early evening. Best guess, this sun either isn't putting out nearly the same amount of light as ours, or there is some heavy atmospheric interference. Light meter is reading at just over 11,000 lux, and there isn't a cloud in the sky. We ain't in Kansas anymore, boys.

14:33 -

 The Bridge dumped the drone out in what appears to be a city of some kind. The buildings are all pretty tall and based off the altitude of the drone, I'd estimate the nearest bunch at about 71 meters, but if these windows are any indicator, these stories are all 7-8 meters each. The scale seems all off, but I'm guessing the inhabitants of 1865 are a bit taller than us.

14:34 -

 Speaking of inhabitants, I haven't seen a soul. This place appears to be fairly well-maintained, so I'd expect to see 

someone

, but nada. I checked the drone's stealth field and nothing seems to be off. Even in the weird light there, it should be working fine. I guess this is why the survey AIC checked this place as a 2935 world, but I haven't seen any bodies either.

14:39 -

 I've been looking around for signs of damage. Crashed cars, burnt buildings, anything. Nothing consistent with people just up and dying. There's no detritus either, nothing that would indicate a rapid evacuation, nor the looting you'd expect from a place that's been abandoned. Nothing. It's like everyone just left in a calm, orderly fashion.

14:41 -

 That's gotta be residential. That looks like a bed… Maybe a desk, too? If there were bars on the window, I'd call that a cell and not a bedroom.

15:51 -

 Just passed the half-hour mark, and I still haven't found anything to suggest why no one's here. The buildings, roads, everything is in great condition. There is evidence that someone definitely lived here, I pushed the drone close enough to one of the buildings to look in through the windows. Definitely a habitation of some kind, though with precious little by way of decoration.

15:52 -

 That isn't the only thing, either. There aren't any ads on any of the buildings. No billboards, no signs in any windows, nothing. I found what looks like graffiti on several of the buildings at street-level, but the writing is definitely not anything I'd recognize from our world. Lots of straight lines. Runic, if I had a guess. There are symbols that look vaguely Futhark-ian, but it's just a guess. No other art, though. Just the runes, and not much of that.

16:04 -

 None of the buildings have any sort of markings. No street signs, nothing on the roads themselves aside from lane markings. There are these big things that look like street lights at the intersections, but without power, I have no idea if there are any kind of luminous displays.

16:05 -

 Maybe the whole place would light up like a christmas tree if there was power. I wonder what this place would look like then? Maybe there are no street signs or billboards 'cause everything was done in holo-overlay? I haven't seen anything that I'd call a holo-projector though, but then again, I haven't a clue what one would even look like.

16:11 -

 This place is infuriating. Clearly, this society is/was advanced enough to build on a pretty grand scale- this city stretches for kilometers in every direction, but there is precious little to suggest what kind of people they are- were. Hell, it's not like everyone just vanished all at once, there'd be some evidence of that. In 2935, cars crashed, planes fell out of the sky, power stations blew. There was evidence everywhere that everyone had just… stopped. Even if we didn't have all the bodies, there was ample evidence of- Bah! This is just…

16:13 -

 I gotta get more time. An hour simply isn't enough to really delve into this place. There is definitely enough here to get this place its' own Main listing. See if I can get Trevor to greenlight more exploration. Maybe even get a team together.

16:20 -

 Ok, pulling the drone back out. I think I have enough to show Trevor and get him on my side when it comes to convincing the bean counters we gotta keep exploring.

RE:

 SCP-5637

Trevor,

Thanks for getting behind my request to get 1865 on the List. I didn't expect to get put in charge of the thing, so thanks for the promotion too! I don't think I'll need a full team or anything, I'm gonna run a few more drone trips through first, get more of a feel for what's on the other side. Playing it safe, you know?

I'll poke at you in a few days with more data, and I'll get a report up to you soonest.

RE:

 Re:SCP-5637

Jasmine,

You put together a convincing report. SCP-5637 is exactly the kind of thing Multi-U was established to find. Who knows what kind of goodies we'll get over there? The sociological data alone could be worth the budget, not to mention the construction techniques.

Your report mentioned that it looked like there was a major hub not far from where the bridge dumped out? Taller buildings, anyway. Get me some footage of those buildings, take what time you need, and let me know if you need a better set of drones.

As for the promotion, it was time. I've had my eye on you for an L03 slot for a while, and you've definitely earned it. Just keep giving me good work on the CBs and we'll call it even.

01:21 -

 I've been at it for, I don't know, 8- 9 hours now? The day/night cycle over there is different from ours, and I guess I'm taking on the habits of working on their time. Gotta get some coffee.

01:23 -

 Gonna check out this building cluster first.

02:40 -

 Where's that coffee? I thought I- Oh. Right.

03:26 -

 This symbol, over and over again. I don't- I don't know what it is. It's familiar though. I just can't… I just can't place it.

05:17 -

 I never did get that coffee, did I?

06:23 -

 This is definitely a different city now. The topography of SCP-5637 seems to be all mountains and valleys, at least the parts of it I've been able to see. It makes it hard to see the horizons, there are always more mountains. This range must be absolutely massive, and it just goes on and on. This city, um, SCP-5637-2 is similar, but different. The buildings are more "formal"? Maybe a place of regional government.

06:25 -

 The buildings are longer than tall, that's for sure. More spread out. There are open areas here, not so crowded. But that symbol is more prominent. Religious?

06:29 -

 That spreading tree motif is everywhere here. Vaguely Germanic. Norse? Fits the Yggdrasil symbolism- branches above, roots below. Fits with the runic script. I'll have to look into it more.

07:49 -

 Oh, hey Paul. Yeah, an all-nighter. 

[Strained laughter]

 Sorry, yeah. I'll go freshen up. Maybe catch a nap. Sorry I've been so absent-minded. Just, you know. Gotta impress the bosses.

07:51 -

 No. Nothing that interesting, really. Boring. Cataloguing a few buildings, that's all.

07:52 -

 Thanks, I appreciate it, but I think I should do this one. Bailey gave it to me, and I-

07:53 -

 No, no! It's not like that at all. I just want to live up to expectations. You know how it is.

07:55 -

 Don't worry about it. If it gets too much, I'll let you know. Yeah, I'm signing out now, gonna go get some coffee. Thanks.

RE:

 Report?

Jasmine,

Hey, I noticed that you've been putting a lot of hours in on the drones. I also noticed that one of the drones is missing? What's going on? You've been pulling so many hours of overtime I'm getting worried about you, are you ok?

I've also not gotten any updates from you since the SCP-5637 project first started. Is everything on schedule? I've got a quarterly coming up, and I'd like to fill Director Holman in on what's been going on.

If you need anything, please just let me know.

Thanks,

Trevor

[BEGIN LOG]

09:31 -

 I've had to get a lot more creative- Uh, drone launching… now.

09:33 -

 I've had to get a lot more creative in how I'm preparing these reports. Just enough to keep stringing Bailey along, but not so much that he wants to push more people at me. Paul's been a godsend in that, he's covered for me a lot more than I want to admit.

09:42 -

 We've pretty much covered all of SCP-5637-1 & -2, and I think I can finally get to SCP-5637-3 today. I think I've made my reports of the Residential and Municipality complexes boring enough that I should be able to get away with just re-shuffling some of the footage from -2 and uploading that to SCiPnet. I should be able to hide my -3 exploration well enough.

09:44 -

 The embedded [DATA EXPUNGED] antimeme in my previous uploads seems to be doing the trick, and hardly anyone is asking about my damn reports anymore. Fucking Bailey always breathing down my neck. Bastard's a goddamn micromanager. Never realized that before.

09:46-10:21 -

 [Data omitted for irrelevancy.]

10:28 -

 Coming up over the crest now, and the Himinbjörg complex is coming into view.

10:32 -

 All of this looks familiar as hell. I feel like I know this place. The towers are exactly where I expect- Oh. How is this possible?

10:40:

 The drone deciphered a broadcast coming from the complex, it filtered out a latent memetic agent– so that's something.

THE FOLLOWING MESSAGE IS BROUGHT TO YOU BY THE FOUNDATION.

As announced in our previous broadcast, there is currently a solar phenomena visible from earth. Any foreign misinformation is to be ignored– the moon poses no threat. Please exit your homes in an orderly fashion and look towards the sky.

It just keeps going, the same thing over and over again.

10:51 -

 That seals it. There's no way it can be anything else, I've been there too often not to know. Although a bit bigger, this is Site-█; there's slight differences but it's basically the same. Same towers, same central dome, even the architecture on the main entrance is the same. Everything's on the Jötunheimr scale size-wise, but I live there! I'd recognize it anywhere.

10:52 -

 Well, not there. This universe's variation anyway.

10:53 -

 I bet I can get inside. Just got to-

The rest of this file has been expunged, as per O5-Ord.2018.0145

RE:

 SCP-5637 Research Status.

Overseer,

Per your request, I've put together a summary of Dr. Ephraim's findings into SCP-5637. I've created a secure folder at [DATA EXPUNGED] that contains all relevant audio, visual, and notated documents for your perusal. If you have any questions, I am at your service.

Thanks,

Trevor

 Re:SCP-5637 Research Status

Trevor,

I appreciate the work that you've put into this, but I am afraid I'm going to have to close the file.

As I told you over the phone, I've sent the appropriate documentation to Edgar in order to go through and clean up some things I would rather not be in the official record. I realize that this will place some undo hardship on you and your office, and I'll understand if you want to undergo amnestic treatment as well, but the choice remains yours as the department head. It is imperative that knowledge of SCP-5637 does not get further disseminated, and I trust your judgment on how best to do that.

At least there isn't a body.

RE:

 Re:Re:SCP-5637 Research Status.

I appreciate the candor, Overseer. I'm not sure I entirely agree with your reasoning on how best to contain the Aesir-Class threat, but you're the boss. If I accept Amnestic treatment, will you tell me more? I know it's a big ask, but one doesn't simply ignore the fact that one of their model employees just… breaks all protocol like that. I don't even know how she was able to use the Bridge, but I've seen the footage.

This "Himinbjörg complex" is Site-2, isn't it? I recognize it too, just as Jasmine did. What happened over there? How did she just, disintegrate like that? What happened in SCP-5637 that you're not telling me? This is my area, Overseer. I need to know if I'm sending more people to their deaths simply by doing their jobs.

Máni happened, that's what.

Look, there aren't a lot of answers I can give you, and for that I'm sorry. That's all I'm going to tell you, that's all I CAN tell you for now.

Just let me know if your researchers find any more abandoned worlds, and I'll make the call on whether to proceed. For now, I'm transferring ownership of the SCP-5637 file to you and I'm having all the records shifted to Site-64.
