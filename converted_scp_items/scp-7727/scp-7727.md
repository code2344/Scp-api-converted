Dr. Roberts.
**Item #:** SCP-7727
**Object Class:** Euclid
**Special Containment Procedures:** Dr. Roberts' office has been relocated to containment chamber 34A-C, where he is to continue his work remotely. The chamber is not ventilated and is temperature controlled to 2° C. Dr. Roberts is not permitted to leave his containment chamber under any circumstances. No meals are to be supplied.
**Description:** SCP-7727 refers to an anomalous scent produced by Dr. Jackson Roberts. SCP-7727 possesses a low odor detection threshold and high concentration, making it extremely potent and overpowering. The scent has been compared to Cadaverine[1](javascript:;) and Putrescine[2](javascript:;) by Foundation biochemists.
To date, Dr. Roberts is the only individual not affected by SCP-7727.
**Discovery:** SCP-7727 first came to Foundation attention following various Human Resources complaints regarding Dr. Roberts. At first thought to be a personal problem, Dr. Roberts was ordered to take steps to improve his hygiene by HR personnel. After 16 further complaints were filed within a span of 3 days, Dr. Roberts was forcibly taken from his office during work hours and thoroughly bathed by two D-Class personnel supplied with gas masks.
Following the conclusion of this bath, Dr. Roberts still exuded SCP-7727 and was taken to [Site-55](/secure-facility-dossier-site-55)'s Intake Department for processing. While present, two personnel fainted from the smell and the remaining five refused to process Dr. Roberts until they were similarly supplied with gas masks.
**Addendum 7727.1:** The following attached document is a recorded conversation between Dr. Roberts and Researcher Chun, an Intake Department member assisting in Dr. Robert's processing.
_Note: Chun had previously commanded Roberts to remove his clothing as part of the standard humanoid intake assessment procedure._
**< BEGIN LOG>**
**Roberts:** This is so humiliating.
**Chun:** It could be worse.
**Roberts:** It can't be _that_ bad, can it? I mean, come on. I shower just like everyone else! I put on deodorant _and_ cologne!
**Chun:** Sit still a moment, I'm trying to take your blood pressure.
**Roberts:** Sorry.
_[There is a ten-second silence.]_
**Chun:** Stupid sphygmomanometer. It's probably broken. I can't seem to get a read on your blood pressure. Hold on. Let me grab a pulse oximeter.
_[There is a five-second silence.]_
**Roberts:** Is that one of those that goes on the finger?
**Chun:** Yup.
_[There is a five-second silence, followed by a beeping.]_
**Chun:** Huh. What are the odds of my sphygmomanometer and oximeter being broken at the same time?
_[Chun removes the oximeter from Roberts' finger, but half of his index finger comes along with the oximeter. Roberts recoils.]_
**Roberts:** My finger! Aaaah!
**Chun:** Don't be such a baby. We can grow it back.
**Roberts:** You psychopath, you broke off my finger! What's the matter with you?!
**Chun:** Dr. Roberts, please calm down. We can't process you if you keep yelling.
**Roberts:** Fine.
_[Chun reaches for his stethoscope.]_
**Chun:** One last try. Let's see what's going on with you.
_[There is an eight-second silence.]_
**Chun:** Nothing.
**Roberts:** What do you mean nothing?
**Chun:** Exactly that. I got nothing.
**Roberts:** Well… I feel fine. I guess nothing ain't so bad.
**Chun:** Except for the fact that you stink.
**Roberts:** Oh come on, it really can't be that bad if I can't even smell it!
**< END LOG>**
_End-Note: Dr. Roberts continued to argue with Chun over the smell of SCP-7727 for approximately fifteen minutes before being escorted to his new containment chamber. On the way, Dr. Roberts stubbed his toe against a wall and complained about it coming unattached but was quickly stopped from complaining by guard personnel. Dr. Roberts' next of kin were informed as per[family disclosure protocol](/family-disclosure-protocol) and direct containment of SCP-7727 began._
