Addendum 6790 I:

 Discovery

SCP-6790 was discovered after an investigation into the abnormal disappearance of one Samuel Barlow on September 9th, 2020. An investigation was performed by the Foundation Investigation Department. The local police were amnesticized and dismissed.

The investigation uncovered a small sample of SCP-6790 and SCP-6790-1 within the office of Mayor Barlow. Following an examination of the office, DNA samples were found, and the perpetrator was identified as Dean Conwell. The full supply of SCP-6790 was found after a raid on the before-mentioned individual's house.
