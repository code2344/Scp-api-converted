Sample of SCP-6790, provided for testing.
**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-6790 is currently stored in Secure Containment Locker #907, with access being restricted to Level-3 personnel. Any other form of SCP-6790 or SCP-6790-1 found outside of containment is to be confiscated immediately.
SCP-6790-1 is contained within a standard anomalous fauna containment kennel and is to be cared for similar to non-anomalous members of the _Anas platyrhynchos_.Commonly referred to as a Mallard Duck. species. Interviews with SCP-6790-1 are to be conducted bi-weekly, along with its psychological assessment.
MTF Aleph-21 ("fine customers") are to continue their research on the PoI "dado".
**Description:** SCP-6790 is a powder-based narcotic closely resembling cocaine that, when ingested, causes the individual consuming the substance to instantaneously transform into a _Anas platyrhynchos_ , hereby referred to as SCP-6790-1.Currently, there's only one instance of SCP-6790 (_See Below_). . The Foundation currently has no means by which to revert this, and the chemical study of SCP-6790 is ongoing.
SCP-6790-1 is a _Anas platyrhynchos_ previously known as Samuel Barlow, former mayor of Retrinald, New South Wales (Australia). SCP-6790-1 is capable of vocalization and contains a complete match for the human genome. SCP-6790-1 is otherwise non-anomalous.
**Addendum 6790 I:** Discovery
SCP-6790 was discovered after an investigation into the abnormal disappearance of one Samuel Barlow on September 9th, 2020. An investigation was performed by the Foundation Investigation Department. The local police were amnesticized and dismissed.
The investigation uncovered a small sample of SCP-6790 and SCP-6790-1 within the office of Mayor Barlow. Following an examination of the office, DNA samples were found, and the perpetrator was identified as Dean Conwell. The full supply of SCP-6790 was found after a raid on the before-mentioned individual's house.
