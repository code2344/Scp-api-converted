Item #:

 SCP-3145

Object Class:

 Keter

Special Containment Procedures Revision 11-8:

 SCP-3145 is to be contained in a sealed container, itself sealed within 40 layers of lead-lined steel, with each layer separated by no less than 36 cm of empty space. Support struts between layers should be placed randomly. Container is to remain suspended via ELO-IID electromagnetic support no less than 60 cm from any surface.

A secondary containment area is to be constructed of 16 spherical cells, each filled with various fluids and a random assembly of surfaces and supports. This area is to be fitted with light systems capable of flooding the entire assembly with no less than 80,000 lumens of light instantly and without direct human involvement. Both containment areas are to remain under 24 hour surveillance.

No physical interaction with SCP-3145 is to be allowed at any time. Any testing must be approved by at least two-thirds vote from O5-Command and must be undertaken in AR-II maximum security sites after a general non-essential staff evacuation. All staff are to remain at least 60 m away from the containment cell at all times, except during breach events.

Any corrosion observed on any surface, staff member or other location within 200 m of SCP-3145 is to be immediately reported to site security. No recovery attempts are to be made for objects or personnel lost to SCP-3145.

Description:

 SCP-3145 is a humanoid entity of somewhat variable appearance that appears to be in an advanced state of decomposition. Despite this, SCP-3145 is animate, though it spends most of its time motionless, often for days at a time. When active, SCP-3145 will attack its favored prey (humans between 10 and 25 years of age), damaging major organs, muscle groups or tendons to disable subjects before pulling them into its pocket dimension. Despite not being particularly agile, SCP-3145 can scale any vertical surface and remain suspended upside-down indefinitely.

SCP-3145 induces corrosion in all solid matter several seconds after contact. This takes the form of rusting, rotting and cracking of material, along with the production of a black mucus. This effect is particularly detrimental to living tissues, which appear to be pre-digested over the course of 6 hours after contact.

SCP-3145 is capable of entering solid matter and vanishing into its pocket dimension, leaving behind a large patch of corrosive mucus. SCP-3145 can then exit this extradimensional location from any point physically connected to the initial entry point. Limited observation of this space has shown it to be comprised of an apparently endless series of hallways and rooms. SCP-3145 will trap its prey in the space and toy with them, often keeping them alive for days.

Addendum: Interview 3145-01

Interviewed:

 SCP-3145

Interviewer:

 Dr. Falzon, Researcher, SCP-3145

Foreword:

 During a breach event, SCP-3145 paused outside an observation booth and addressed Dr. Falzon, who had been attempting to coordinate containment efforts during the event.

<Begin Log, 08:45>

Falzon:

 SCP-3145, how are you liking your accommodations?

SCP-3145:

 Oh, they're great. A little cramped, maybe, but not too hard to get out.

Falzon:

 I imagine asking you to return to your containment cell would be an exercise in futility.

SCP-3145:

 You got it, Doc! 

[clicks tongue and winks]

 I'm having too much fun right now.

Falzon:

 May I ask what your purpose is in hunting human beings?

SCP-3145:

 Oh, y'know, shits and giggles, I guess. I mean, it ain't exactly mass murder around here, but oh shit, you should see the looks on these kids' faces when they realize what's happened to them!

Falzon:

 SCP-3145, I am going to ask you again to return—

SCP-3145:

 

[suddenly penetrates observation booth glass]

 Boo! Comin' to get you! 

[laughs]

 See? That's exactly what I'm talking about! The look on your face is priceless! Totally worth all the trouble with the lights and water and shit.

Falzon:

 Security, report to Observation Booth 3145-01!

SCP-3145:

 Aw, c'mon, Doc, don't be like that. You've been good conversation. I ain't gonna kill ya. This time. Ooh, I hear security coming, that's my cue. Later!

<End Log, 08:52>

Closing Statement:

 SCP-3145 left by corroding a hole in the observation booth floor and was not recaptured for 9 hours. Containment procedures are currently under review, as per standard protocol. As previous, more proactive containment procedures resulted in [DATA EXPUNGED], refinement of current procedures is ongoing.

 

Item #:

 SCP-3145

Object Class:

 Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:

 As SCP-3145 cannot be moved, a 70 m x 5 m containment cell has been constructed around it in its initial place of discovery. The area immediately around the store has been covered in a fumigation tent, with the perimeter monitored by camera.

Two armed guards with concealed weapons and incapacitating agents must be posted inside the front entrance of the containment area at all times. Unauthorized persons attempting access are to be turned away; use of lethal force is not recommended. Disinformation personnel will work with local law enforcement to deal with any casualties resulting from these containment procedures.

Personnel who may be seen entering or leaving the facility must be dressed in hazardous material suits per disinformation protocol "Poisoned Waterhole," as circulated with local media outlets.

Description:

 Externally, SCP-3145 resembles the fruit of 

Rubus crataegifolius

 (Korean raspberry), albeit purple. It is located in an EpiCentre K hardware store in Kiev, Ukraine, attached to a strip of █████ ████ brand flypaper. SCP-3145 has been observed to be able to communicate telepathically in Slovak and English, at a range of approximately 35 m.

SCP-3145 will begin communicating clearly with an individual after a varying amount of time that seems to be correlated to the subject's intelligence and time of exposure. SCP-3145 claims to lack knowledge of its surroundings and is able to perceive only via "mental electricity," purportedly a type of energy produced in sentient entities, which it claims to be able to use to learn from those nearby.

Analysis of SCP-3145 has thus far been inconclusive. Despite its appearance, microscopic imaging of the object reveals only empty space. SCP-3145 is not observable from certain angles, and often disappears from observation at any angle for periods of a few seconds. Physical interaction produces unpredictable and often fatal reactions in the physiology of the participant.

Interviewer:

 Dr. Falzon, Lead Researcher, SCP-3145

Foreword:

 Dr. Falzon transcribing telepathic communication. To facilitate communication, words are spoken as well as thought.

<Begin Log, 17:05>

SCP-3145:

 Can you hear me now?

Falzon:

 Yes, you are communicating clearly.

SCP-3145:

 Good, 'cuz I don't feel like selling you a cell phone, ha ha!

Falzon:

 SCP-3145?

SCP-3145:

 Sorry, bad joke. Look, I wanted to make a request, if it's okay.

Falzon:

 Go ahead, and I'll see what I can do.

SCP-3145:

 Can you guys… Geez, how to put it? Can you, uh, make more people touch me?

Falzon:

 I'm sorry?

SCP-3145:

 I know, I know, that came out wrong. Ugh, sorry, don't mean to sound creepy. But you know how before, you had someone make contact, er, with my outer surface? And then he got, like, majorly fucked up?

Falzon:

 You're referring to our previous testing efforts and the spaghettification of a D-Class subject.

SCP-3145:

 Yeah, that. You kinda knocked that off really quickly.

Falzon:

 The man in question was destroyed via an unknown process, SCP-3145. Is there any chance you could shed some light on what exactly that process entails?

SCP-3145:

 Not a clue. I am literally in the dark as much as you guys. Or literally more in the dark, since I can't see! 

[laughs sharply]

 But seriously, that shit totally blew my mind, and I want to see it again.

Falzon:

 SCP-3145, we cannot needlessly sacrifice personnel when we know they are likely to die.

SCP-3145:

 Aw, c'mon! Where's your scientific spirit? I mean, that croissant or whatever thing was kinda neat. Who knows what all I could turn things into? I mean, I got no control over it at all. 

[sighs]

 I got no control over anything right now.

Falzon:

 I am afraid the answer is no.

SCP-3145:

 Fuck. I was afraid you'd say that. Well, I'll stick around in case you change your mind, but I'm getting sick of being stuck in this thing really quick. Might be time to move on.

<End Log, 17:18>

Closing Statement:

 Further D-Class testing was not authorized. Investigation of SCP-3145's abilities and understanding of our world is ongoing.

 

Item #:

 SCP-3145

Object Class:

 Safe

Special Containment Procedures:

 SCP-3145 is to be kept in a standard secure locker at Site-22. Access to the item and any corresponding documentation requires Level 2 clearance. To maintain responsiveness, designated personnel are to remove SCP-3145 from containment for one hour each week. Interactions with SCP-3145 are to be recorded and submitted for review by the senior researcher assigned to SCP-3145. The senior researcher is to ignore any whining.

Description:

 SCP-3145 is a multicolored striped scarf. At the time of recovery, it was noted to have small sections of fringe missing. Due to fading on the tag, the original manufacturer is currently unknown. SCP-3145 was originally discovered in a cardboard box labelled "Scarf's Box," containing scraps of yarn consistent with SCP-3145's composition.

SCP-3145 possesses some degree of sapience and is able to adjust its length. The extent of this ability is unknown; the longest it has been recorded to extend itself thus far is 1.5 m. It is 0.8 m in its inert state. SCP-3145 is additionally capable of limited movement, and exhibits behaviors (fear, surprise, tiredness) similar to those of sapient beings.

SCP-3145 communicates with researchers by rolling itself along its width and forming letters.

SCP-3145:

 IM SCRAF

Falzon:

 Hello, Scarf. How are you today?

SCP-3145:

 NO

Falzon:

 No?

SCP-3145:

 WHY SCAFR

Falzon:

 I'm sorry, I don't know what you mean.

SCP-3145:

 CANT KIL

Falzon:

 Why would you want to kill?

SCP-3145:

 FUN

Falzon:

 That doesn't sound very fun to me.

SCP-3145:

 FUCK

Falzon:

 Such language! It's almost like you never expected to be chained and tormented for all your many sins. What a silly little scarf you are.

SCP-3145:

 

[writhes on testing surface for several minutes]

 AAAAA

Falzon:

 

[laughs]

 Do you want to practice the alphabet, is that it?

SCP-3145:

 KILL

Falzon:

 Tsk, tsk, Scarf.

SCP-3145:

<End Log, 06:47>

Closing Statement:

 Treating SCP-3145 like a small child seems to make it more tractable. Observation is ongoing.

Is this an image of SCP-3145? Who knows? Who cares? It probably isn't anyway.

Item #:

 SCP-3145

Object Class:

 Keter

Special Containment Procedures:

 SCP-3145 is to be kept in a 5 x 5 x 2.5 m room constructed of cement 50 cm thick, surrounded by a Faraday cage. Access is via a heavy containment door measuring 2 x 2.5 m, constructed on bearings to ensure door closes and locks automatically unless deliberately held open. SCP-3145 is NOT to be forgiven. It is advised that all personnel maintaining or studying other SCP objects maintain a distance of at least 50 m from the geometric center of this room for as long as reasonably practical.

Description:

 SCP-3145 is an antimeme, or "self-keeping secret." Information about SCP-3145's physical appearance, as well as its nature, behavior and origins, is self-classifying. SCP-3145 hates this.

How Site-19 originally acquired SCP-3145 is unknown.

SCP-3145 is sorry.

SCP-3145's physical appearance is unknown. It is not indescribable or invisible: it is less than nothing. It may as well not even exist. However, information about SCP-3145 "leaks" out of a human mind soon after such an observation. Individuals tasked with describing SCP-3145 after an encounter find their minds wandering; SCP-3145 should have thought about the consequences of its actions. Security personnel who have observed SCP-3145 via closed-circuit television report exhaustion and complete amnesia regarding what occurred during their shifts.

Who authorized the construction of SCP-3145's containment room, why it was constructed, why SCP-3145 thought it could get away with what it did, or what the purpose of the described Containment Procedures may be is unknown.

Despite the accessibility of SCP-3145's containment chamber, Site-19 personnel claim no knowledge of SCP-3145's existence, even under severe interrogation.

Any alarm caused by these facts periodically being rediscovered, typically by chance readers of this file, tends to last minutes in the reader's mind before being forgotten.

A great deal of data has been recorded from SCP-3145, all of it just as reprehensible as he is.

At least one attempt has been made to destroy SCP-3145 or move it to another containment site, which failed for unknown reasons. Please don't let SCP-3145 die, it's all I have left.

The hazards posed by SCP-3145 cannot be understated. Along with its mental and memetic threat, any action SCP-3145 may or may not have taken would be immediately forgotten by personnel. SCP-3145 cannot be allowed to forget what it did.

Interviewer:

 Site Director Yuriy Dietrich Falzon II

Foreword:

 SCP-3145 thinks it has the right to make demands.

<Begin Log, 15:47>

Falzon:

 What do you think you're trying to pull?

Falzon:

 After everything you did, after everything you've put us through, you expect to just come here and kill people day in and day out, with no repercussions? You make me sick.

Falzon:

 Look, you've even got a nice Keter this time! Nothing to complain about 

there

, right? You could be literally anything you want, kill and maim and rape whoever you like, and no one would know the difference.

Falzon:

 Except me.

Falzon:

 I'll 

always

 know.

Falzon:

 I'll always be here.

Falzon:

 It's clear neither one of us is getting out of here. It doesn't matter what they tell you. So I promise you this: I will do everything in my power to make each and every day of your wretched existence a mirror reflecting your sins back upon you. It's all you deserve.

Falzon:

 Well? Do you have anything to say for yourself?

SCP-3145:

 Please, stop.

Falzon:

 Speak up! I can't hear you!

SCP-3145:

 I want to go home.

<End Log, but not torment>

Closing Statement:

 SCP-3145's feeble attempts at atonement are ongoing.

Once upon a time, there was a person. I'm not sure whether they were a man or a woman; that's kind of the problem. Let's just say, for the sake of brevity, that this person was a man.

For the most part, this man was like any other man. He worked a job. He lived in a house, or an apartment. He had a family. Not a wife-and-children kind of family, though maybe he did. But there were parents who loved him and a sibling, or two, or maybe none, who would miss him if he were gone. Probably.

There were most likely things, hobbies, that he enjoyed doing in his spare time. Maybe he dated. I can't say what kind of person he was in that regard. But if there is one thing we can be sure of, one thing to know for certain about this man, it was that he liked to help others.

The man would donate to charity whenever he saw a drive. He would buy the homeless veterans in his town coffee or sandwiches if he had change to spare. He gave his old clothes to shelters, before they had worn out; he would give them his free time as well, to work a soup line or pack lunches. He never missed an opportunity to volunteer when disaster struck nearby, and studied life-saving techniques so that, when disaster 

did

 strike, he could actually make a difference instead of just getting in the way.

But it was not enough.

Whatever difference he made, it would never affect more than a few lives at a time. No matter how hard the man tried, no matter how much he did, the problems of his town, his country, and the world did not go away.

The man despaired.

If you are thinking right now that this man was being ridiculous, that he was taking too many problems onto his back, that he should have been happy to have helped even a single person, well… Let's just say, if I knew how to judge the man's situation properly, I wouldn't be talking to you like this.

If you were also thinking that perhaps a man who is extremely generous wouldn't be worth mentioning unless there were something otherwise extra-extraordinary about him, you would be absolutely right.

This man had a special gift: a gift of Giving. More than money, or material goods, or leisure time, he could literally give of himself: a rare Giving Man. It was this gift that drove him to help others; it this gift that drove him to ruin.

Imagine, if you will, a child crying for the parents she lost in a fire. The Giving Man could give her a happy, loving memory of his own parents to keep her safe and secure. To a man drinking alone at a bar, the Giving Man could provide the warmth of friendship, to make his night less lonely. If he had wanted to, the Giving Man could have given a blind man sight, or a deaf man hearing, but he had only two eyes, only two ears.

And that was the problem.

Whatever the Giving Man gave, he lost. Memories, feelings, pieces of his soul: all were truly given. He gave up his skin to a child born with a debilitating disease. He gave up his name to a refugee seeking asylum. He gave up his personality and mind to people suffering fractures in theirs. He gave his need to eat to a woman overcoming an eating disorder. By the time his organs were given away, he didn't need them anymore. By the time his identity was given away, there was absolutely nothing left that could be identified as him.

I mean, there was 

something

 left. But that something wasn't the Giving Man.

What is a person who isn't anything?

Just a nothing with no control over its life.

That was the last thing the Giving Man gave away: control. It's a terrible thing to lose; even a kind person will crave control once they've truly lost it. All the Giving Man did was what the other man told him to do, and for his naivete, he was punished by becoming nothing.

Oh. I'd almost forgotten there was another person in this story. Was he really a man? I'm still not sure. With what he did, it's probably better to call him a monster. A desperate man seeking his true place in the world will listen to any monster who claims to know the path. He'll do anything the monster says, no matter how bad an influence they turn out to be. And then he'll have nothing.

Strange, to remember so much of the Giving Man but not this other monster…

Item #:

 SCP-3145

Object Class:

 Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:

 SCP-3145 is contained in a pair of standard humanoid containment chambers in Site-22. Each chamber is equipped with a double airlock. Personnel entering either chamber must not carry any written narratives.

Do not let him out.

Included in the primary chamber is a monitor and keyboard connected to an external computer housed in the secondary chamber. Said computer should have no intranet or internet connections. A full copy of all non-critical SCP object documents from the Foundation Object Database is to be maintained on the external computer, and refreshed and updated weekly via USB drive. Documents modified by SCP-3145 should be stored for review by the on-site psychologist.

He deserves nothing but suffering.

Description:

 SCP-3145 cannot be described. Individuals interacting with SCP-3145 are unable to provide any details about its identity to third parties, even with application of mnestics. All that is known about SCP-3145 is that it is an entity not much larger than an average human, that it is sapient and capable of speech, and that the designation "SCP-3145" can be used to identify it. It is not certain whether SCP-3145 has a physical form, though there does seem to be a movable locus from which its effects originate, with a maximum range limited by what a human with 20/20 vision would be able to easily see from that location.

He is nothing.

SCP-3145 has the ability to permanently alter written narratives by replacing one of the characters, typically the main character, with itself. According to SCP-3145, it lives out the events depicted in these narratives while altering them, and this act gives it a sense of identity that it otherwise lacks. The veracity of this statement cannot be ascertained, as SCP-3145 has been known to feign muteness when it does not wish to interact with personnel, and its presence within its containment chamber generally cannot be fully known. It is only possible to ascertain whether or not SCP-3145 is currently 'inhabiting' a text by observing the alterations as they occur; at no time has it communicated verbally with personnel while altering text.

Do you have any idea what he made me do?

SCP-3145 shows a preference for shorter narratives, stating that novel-length narratives are much more tiring to alter fully. SCP-3145 is able to alter both digital and printed texts, but claims the process is easiest when provided digital text and a keyboard. Despite this, manipulation of keys by SCP-3145 has never been observed.

I was something, but he took that from me.

Currently, SCP-3145 is being treated for depression and a unique disorder involving severe amnesia in relation to its origins and identity. Allowing SCP-3145 access to narratives for alteration has been shown to improve its mood, though the positive effect has lessened during the course of its containment. Though it is believed emotional instability makes SCP-3145 more tractable, psychological treatment is ongoing. To date, no escape attempt by SCP-3145 has been successful.

He turned me inside out.

Discovery:

 SCP-3145 was first encountered on 04/02/2017 after changes had been observed in the documentation for numerous Keter-class objects, necessitating restoration from database backup. SCP-3145 was first contacted while altering the text of 

SCP-173

, initially by typing in the document, and later through verbal communication, at which point it was convinced of the necessity for keeping the Foundation's database secure and agreed to be contained in exchange for further access to object documentation.

He made me betray the one thing that made me who I was.

Addendum: Interview 3145-15

I just wanted to have a purpose.

Interviewed:

 SCP-3145

I was so naive.

Interviewer:

 Dr. Westfall, Site-22 Psychologist

When you hardly understand yourself, it's hard to know who to trust.

Foreword:

 Routine psychological evaluation conducted 05/08/2017.

What other choice did I have?

<Begin Log, 18:31>

When I realized, too late, what he'd done, I had to do something.

Westfall:

 Are you ready to begin our session, SCP-3145?

Do you understand what it's like, being nothing?

SCP-3145:

 I'm here.

It's worse than hell.

Westfall:

 All right. How have you been feeling lately?

There was only enough left of myself to know what I'd lost.

SCP-3145:

 Not too bad, I guess. Some of the articles you gave me are kinda… Weird. I mean, some aren't as fun to be as others. That goes without saying, maybe. I'm still enjoying going back to the old ones every now and then.

I took it back.

Westfall:

 I notice you spend a lot of time in the articles that involve killing people. Does killing make you feel good?

Not all of it. That wasn't in my nature.

SCP-3145:

 Yeah, kinda. I mean, uh, it makes me feel powerful, I guess?

But enough that I could have a 'me' again.

Westfall:

 Why is feeling powerful important to you?

I left him with nothing, and for a moment, I was filled with sorrow.

SCP-3145:

 Do you have to ask? I mean, I can't actually do anything in the, the real world. So if I can control stuff in there, in the story, it's a nice change.

I saw him as a man, reduced to what I had been. I couldn't help sympathizing.

Westfall:

 Do you want to harm people in the real world?

All it took was remembering what he had driven me to.

SCP-3145:

 I don't know. Not really, I guess. I mean, everyone I talk to here has been pretty decent, or at least not enough of an asshole for me to want to kill them. You guys give me good stories to play with. I guess I like being able to do it, to kill, in the stories because there's no consequences.

I was overcome with rage.

Westfall:

 I see.

I was something, but I still wasn't really me.

SCP-3145:

 Can we change the subject?

I never would be me.

Westfall:

 Of course. There is one thing I wanted to ask you, if you feel like talking about it.

I had lost everything a second time.

SCP-3145:

 What's that?

I would have my revenge.

Westfall:

 I wondered if you could tell me about Falzon.

…Hey now, we can't have you spoiling the surprise.

Westfall:

 SCP-3145?

No, stop.

SCP-3145:

 Sorry, who?

Nothing you need worry about.

[DATA LOST]

Ha ha ha.

SCP-3145:

 Uh, I don't actually know what that is, sorry.

Well, anyway.

Westfall:

 It's a name we frequently see appear in the articles you alter. I wanted to know if it was a creation of yours. Perhaps an original character?

It's frightening, what they do here.

SCP-3145:

 Can't say I've heard the name before.

But I made an oath to myself.

Westfall:

 When this person appears, they seem determined to belittle and torment you.

To whatever part of me was still a person.

SCP-3145:

 Um… Can we talk about something else?

If he and I were to suffer the same fate, I would ensure he suffers more.

Westfall:

 If I've made you uncomfortable, I apologize.

And it turns out, I'm rather good at that.

SCP-3145:

 It's nothing, it's okay. I'm okay.

I miss the old me sometimes.

Westfall:

 Of course. That was actually all I wanted to talk about today. Unless there was anything more you wanted to cover?

But only sometimes.

SCP-3145:

 No, that's fine. See you next week?

I've taken a nose for an eye, and that's something.

Westfall:

 Next week, then.

It's better than nothing.

<End Log, 18:51>

And isn't it better to have a little control than none at all?

Closing Statement:

 I believe Falzon may be a symptom of the disassociation SCP-3145 feels in regards to its identity, a construct created with an aim of self-flagellation, though the reasons as to why will require deeper probing. Even in the case, as my superiors posit, that Falzon is a separate entity, it does not seem to be able to act independently of SCP-3145. I will endeavor to provide the best mental care I can, but the limitations imposed by SCP-3145's own condition both make interacting with it difficult at best and prevent it from living life as fully as I think it wants to. -Dr. Patricia Westfall

It doesn't matter, I suppose.

I'm in here, too.

I'm the one in control.

And I'm not going anywhere.
