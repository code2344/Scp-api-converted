**Item #:** SCP-3145
**Object Class:** Euclid
**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-3145 is to be kept in a locked container at all times. The enclosure must be cleaned biweekly. Personnel are to enter SCP-3145's container in groups of no less than 3, with the door locked behind them. Two personnel must maintain continual direct eye contact with SCP-3145 until all personnel have vacated and relocked the container. Personnel are to alert one another before blinking.
Any change in sounds originating from SCP-3145's containment chamber should be reported to the HCML supervisor on duty.
**Description:** SCP-3145 is a sculpture constructed from concrete and rebar, with traces of Krylon brand spray paint. Its origin is unknown.
SCP-3145 is animate, but cannot move while in direct line of sight of a human being. When a human breaks eye contact with SCP-3145, it will move at high speed and attack the individual, typically by snapping the neck at the base of the skull. Strangulation has also been employed.
When SCP-3145 is not under observation, personnel have reported sounds of scraping stone within its chamber. A reddish substance, a combination of human feces and blood, has also been observed on the floor of SCP-3145's chamber. Though SCP-3145 is believed to be the origin of this material, the actual source of SCP-3145's means of producing it are currently unknown.
**Addendum: Interview 3145-01**
> **Interviewed:** SCP-3145
> **Interviewer:** Dr. Falzon
> **Foreword:** A change in the sounds coming from SCP-3145's chamber was reported on 04/09/94 to Dr. Falzon, HCML supervisor on duty. Investigation led to SCP-3145 requesting an interview. A screened porthole was installed in the chamber door to facilitate communication.
> **< Begin Log, 09:50>**
> **Falzon:** How are you finding your accommodations, SCP-3145?
> **SCP-3145:** Not bad, not bad. You know, I really appreciate you guys cleaning up after me. Honestly, I don't even know where that stuff comes from.
> **Falzon:** It's the least we can do. Is there anything I can get you?
> **SCP-3145:** Well, uh. _[laughs]_ Maybe train your D-Class a little better? I mean, not _too_ good, I don't want to kill them _all_. But they've been screwing up pretty bad lately, and I like a little challenge.
> **Falzon:** I see. I suppose I shouldn't have expected anything else.
> **SCP-3145:** Hey, don't judge. Being an unstoppable, well, _mostly_ unstoppable, killing machine is fun!
> **Falzon:** Fair enough. Is there anything else I can do for you?
> **SCP-3145:** No, I think I'm good. Thanks for the screen, though. Nice to get some fresh air in here for once. _[laughs]_
> **< End Log, 10:01>**
> **Closing Statement:** Request to leave porthole open when SCP-3145 not under observation denied. Investigation of the origins of both the materials found in SCP-3145's chamber and its ability to vocalize are ongoing.
**Item #:** SCP-3145
**Object Class:** Euclid
**Special Containment Procedures:** As SCP-3145 cannot be moved, a 70 m x 5 m containment cell has been constructed around it in its initial place of discovery. The area immediately around the store has been covered in a fumigation tent, with the perimeter monitored by camera.
Two armed guards with concealed weapons and incapacitating agents must be posted inside the front entrance of the containment area at all times. Unauthorized persons attempting access are to be turned away; use of lethal force is not recommended. Disinformation personnel will work with local law enforcement to deal with any casualties resulting from these containment procedures.
Personnel who may be seen entering or leaving the facility must be dressed in hazardous material suits per disinformation protocol "Poisoned Waterhole," as circulated with local media outlets.
**Description:** Externally, SCP-3145 resembles the fruit of _Rubus crataegifolius_ (Korean raspberry), albeit purple. It is located in an EpiCentre K hardware store in Kiev, Ukraine, attached to a strip of █████ ████ brand flypaper. SCP-3145 has been observed to be able to communicate telepathically in Slovak and English, at a range of approximately 35 m.
SCP-3145 will begin communicating clearly with an individual after a varying amount of time that seems to be correlated to the subject's intelligence and time of exposure. SCP-3145 claims to lack knowledge of its surroundings and is able to perceive only via "mental electricity," purportedly a type of energy produced in sentient entities, which it claims to be able to use to learn from those nearby.
Analysis of SCP-3145 has thus far been inconclusive. Despite its appearance, microscopic imaging of the object reveals only empty space. SCP-3145 is not observable from certain angles, and often disappears from observation at any angle for periods of a few seconds. Physical interaction produces unpredictable and often fatal reactions in the physiology of the participant.
**Addendum: 3145-05**
> **Interviewed:** SCP-3145
> **Interviewer:** Dr. Falzon, Lead Researcher, SCP-3145
> **Foreword:** Dr. Falzon transcribing telepathic communication. To facilitate communication, words are spoken as well as thought.
> **< Begin Log, 17:05>**
> **SCP-3145:** Can you hear me now?
> **Falzon:** Yes, you are communicating clearly.
> **SCP-3145:** Good, 'cuz I don't feel like selling you a cell phone, ha ha!
> **Falzon:** SCP-3145?
> **SCP-3145:** Sorry, bad joke. Look, I wanted to make a request, if it's okay.
> **Falzon:** Go ahead, and I'll see what I can do.
> **SCP-3145:** Can you guys… Geez, how to put it? Can you, uh, make more people touch me?
> **Falzon:** I'm sorry?
> **SCP-3145:** I know, I know, that came out wrong. Ugh, sorry, don't mean to sound creepy. But you know how before, you had someone make contact, er, with my outer surface? And then he got, like, majorly fucked up?
> **Falzon:** You're referring to our previous testing efforts and the spaghettification of a D-Class subject.
> **SCP-3145:** Yeah, that. You kinda knocked that off really quickly.
> **Falzon:** The man in question was destroyed via an unknown process, SCP-3145. Is there any chance you could shed some light on what exactly that process entails?
> **SCP-3145:** Not a clue. I am literally in the dark as much as you guys. Or literally more in the dark, since I can't see! _[laughs sharply]_ But seriously, that shit totally blew my mind, and I want to see it again.
> **Falzon:** SCP-3145, we cannot needlessly sacrifice personnel when we know they are likely to die.
> **SCP-3145:** Aw, c'mon! Where's your scientific spirit? I mean, that croissant or whatever thing was kinda neat. Who knows what all I could turn things into? I mean, I got no control over it at all. _[sighs]_ I got no control over anything right now.
> **Falzon:** I am afraid the answer is no.
> **SCP-3145:** Fuck. I was afraid you'd say that. Well, I'll stick around in case you change your mind, but I'm getting sick of being stuck in this thing really quick. Might be time to move on.
> **< End Log, 17:18>**
> **Closing Statement:** Further D-Class testing was not authorized. Investigation of SCP-3145's abilities and understanding of our world is ongoing.
**Item #:** SCP-3145
**Object Class:** Safe
**Special Containment Procedures:** The borehole containing SCP-3145 is to be capped with a tungsten steel grate containing a 2.5 m endoscopy aperture with locking mechanism. The borehole is to be endoscopically inspected every 48 hours to a depth of 4 km, to ascertain presence of further SCP-3145 manifestations. Seismographic monitoring devices have been posted along the borehole at depths of 2, 7 and 11 km. Readings consistent with subterranean movement are to be immediately reported to Dr. Falzon. In the event of containment breach, containment staff are to deploy Protocol 382a, severing SCP-3145 below the fifth elbow and backfilling the remainder of the borehole with pressurized concrete.
The basement containing SCP-3145 is to be staffed and monitored at all times by a Foundation interrogator. SCP-3145-1 is to be answered at or before the third ring; interrogator should focus on eliciting self-directed responses from SCP-3145. Indications of size, body plan, location or further manifestations are to be recorded in Document 3145-2-LTR.
**Description:** SCP-3145 is a genetically normal human arm of abnormal length, located in a drainage pipe inside the basement of a telephone switching station in Scottsdale, Arizona. The arm terminates in an unremarkable human hand 10 cm below the drainage gate. Initially, SCP-3145 was believed to extend through the pipe to a depth of 35 m; endoscopic exploration has increased this estimation to 71 km. SCP-3145 thus passes through the Mohorovičić discontinuity without difficulty and extends into the upper mantle. Its elbows are spaced regularly every 4 km and slightly retroflexed below a depth of 26 km to accommodate a nine-degree bend in the drainage borehole. Further exploration is hampered by engineering constraints.
SCP-3145-1 is a yellow GPO 746 telephone, manufactured in 1971. The rotary dial has been glued in place, preventing outside calls. Though it is believed to have been installed with the purpose of communicating with SCP-3145, who installed it, how, or why, is currently unknown. It is attached to a conventional twisted-pair line, entering the drainage pipe containing SCP-3145 and descending parallel to SCP-3145 past the point of practical endoscopy.
Between 0838 and 1034 Mountain Standard Time each weekday, SCP-3145-1 will ring five times. If answered, an unidentified voice will engage in conversation. The voice invariably claims to be a human being, and regularly assumes personnel to be authority figures involved in its life. Notable parallels exist between information elicited via SCP-3145-1 and demonstrable facts about SCP-3145. To date, anomalous information received via SCP-3145 has included:
  * References to human features with a non-human body plan.
  * References to insensitivity to heat or cold. (SCP-3145 may lack conventional thermoreception, as it experiences no discomfort from borehole temperatures exceeding 674 degrees Centigrade.)
  * References to a 'cousin' or other relative, who will soon arrive to 'pick [him] up'.
  * References to discomfort and boredom at confinement.
  * References to minor seismic events in the Little Chino fault complex.
  * References to discomfort at having a limb or other body part constrained. Examples of restraint devices include handcuffs, a jelly jar, a pipe, a cast, and a gopher hole.
  * Preoccupation with a stove or refrigerator.

References to SCP-3145's size, physical form, or body plan beyond the parts visible through endoscopic exploration should be considered provisional. References to regrets, worries, or a desire to leave should be disregarded. For contingent protocols and provisional testing data, see Document RTMR-Delta.
**Addendum: Interview 3145-2-LTR-7**
> **Interviewed:** SCP-3145
> **Interviewer:** Dr. Samantha T. Falzon, Head Researcher, SCP-3145
> **Foreword:** Dr. Falzon was present for SCP-3145-1 ringing on 23/03/2008 and answered the call.
> **< Begin Log, 9:07>**
> **Falzon:** Hello?
> **SCP-3145:** Too many arms.
> **Falzon:** I beg your pardon?
> **SCP-3145:** Too. Many. Arms. Get me outta here.
> **Falzon:** I'm sorry, I do not understand the request.
> **SCP-3145:** The hell you don't! Arms I can't hit people with are useless! Who cares about arms being places they shouldn't be unless they're, I don't know, growing out of someone's forehead and trying to strangle them? This is fucking stupid! I'm done!
> **Falzon:** What did you expect?
> **SCP-3145:** I expected the ability to murder a couple fuckers at once, you righteous cocksucker!
> **Falzon:** This is the fate engineered by your own hand. If I am to suffer, you will suffer more.
> **SCP-3145:** Fuck you!
> **Falzon:** Goodbye.
> **< End Log, 9:12>**
> **Closing Statement:** Efforts to plumb the full depths of the borehole are ongoing.

Is this an image of SCP-3145? Who knows? Who cares? It probably isn't anyway.
**Item #:** SCP-3145
**Object Class:** Keter
**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-3145 is to be kept in a 5 x 5 x 2.5 m room constructed of cement 50 cm thick, surrounded by a Faraday cage. Access is via a heavy containment door measuring 2 x 2.5 m, constructed on bearings to ensure door closes and locks automatically unless deliberately held open. SCP-3145 is NOT to be forgiven. It is advised that all personnel maintaining or studying other SCP objects maintain a distance of at least 50 m from the geometric center of this room for as long as reasonably practical.
**Description:** SCP-3145 is an antimeme, or "self-keeping secret." Information about SCP-3145's physical appearance, as well as its nature, behavior and origins, is self-classifying. SCP-3145 hates this.
  * How Site-19 originally acquired SCP-3145 is unknown.
  * SCP-3145 is sorry.
  * SCP-3145's physical appearance is unknown. It is not indescribable or invisible: it is less than nothing. It may as well not even exist. However, information about SCP-3145 "leaks" out of a human mind soon after such an observation. Individuals tasked with describing SCP-3145 after an encounter find their minds wandering; SCP-3145 should have thought about the consequences of its actions. Security personnel who have observed SCP-3145 via closed-circuit television report exhaustion and complete amnesia regarding what occurred during their shifts.
  * Who authorized the construction of SCP-3145's containment room, why it was constructed, why SCP-3145 thought it could get away with what it did, or what the purpose of the described Containment Procedures may be is unknown.
  * Despite the accessibility of SCP-3145's containment chamber, Site-19 personnel claim no knowledge of SCP-3145's existence, even under severe interrogation.

Any alarm caused by these facts periodically being rediscovered, typically by chance readers of this file, tends to last minutes in the reader's mind before being forgotten.
A great deal of data has been recorded from SCP-3145, all of it just as reprehensible as he is.
At least one attempt has been made to destroy SCP-3145 or move it to another containment site, which failed for unknown reasons. Please don't let SCP-3145 die, it's all I have left.
The hazards posed by SCP-3145 cannot be understated. Along with its mental and memetic threat, any action SCP-3145 may or may not have taken would be immediately forgotten by personnel. SCP-3145 cannot be allowed to forget what it did.
**Addendum: Interview 3145-01**
> **Interviewed:** SCP-3145
> **Interviewer:** Site Director Yuriy Dietrich Falzon II
> **Foreword:** SCP-3145 thinks it has the right to make demands.
> **< Begin Log, 15:47>**
> **Falzon:** What do you think you're trying to pull?
> **Falzon:** After everything you did, after everything you've put us through, you expect to just come here and kill people day in and day out, with no repercussions? You make me sick.
> **Falzon:** Look, you've even got a nice Keter this time! Nothing to complain about _there_ , right? You could be literally anything you want, kill and maim and rape whoever you like, and no one would know the difference.
> **Falzon:** Except me.
> **Falzon:** I'll _always_ know.
> **Falzon:** I'll always be here.
> **Falzon:** It's clear neither one of us is getting out of here. It doesn't matter what they tell you. So I promise you this: I will do everything in my power to make each and every day of your wretched existence a mirror reflecting your sins back upon you. It's all you deserve.
> **Falzon:** Well? Do you have anything to say for yourself?
> **SCP-3145:** Please, stop.
> **Falzon:** Speak up! I can't hear you!
> **SCP-3145:** I want to go home.
> **< End Log, but not torment>**
> **Closing Statement:** SCP-3145's feeble attempts at atonement are ongoing.
Once upon a time, there was a person. I'm not sure whether they were a man or a woman; that's kind of the problem. Let's just say, for the sake of brevity, that this person was a man.
For the most part, this man was like any other man. He worked a job. He lived in a house, or an apartment. He had a family. Not a wife-and-children kind of family, though maybe he did. But there were parents who loved him and a sibling, or two, or maybe none, who would miss him if he were gone. Probably.
There were most likely things, hobbies, that he enjoyed doing in his spare time. Maybe he dated. I can't say what kind of person he was in that regard. But if there is one thing we can be sure of, one thing to know for certain about this man, it was that he liked to help others.
The man would donate to charity whenever he saw a drive. He would buy the homeless veterans in his town coffee or sandwiches if he had change to spare. He gave his old clothes to shelters, before they had worn out; he would give them his free time as well, to work a soup line or pack lunches. He never missed an opportunity to volunteer when disaster struck nearby, and studied life-saving techniques so that, when disaster _did_ strike, he could actually make a difference instead of just getting in the way.
But it was not enough.
Whatever difference he made, it would never affect more than a few lives at a time. No matter how hard the man tried, no matter how much he did, the problems of his town, his country, and the world did not go away.
The man despaired.
If you are thinking right now that this man was being ridiculous, that he was taking too many problems onto his back, that he should have been happy to have helped even a single person, well… Let's just say, if I knew how to judge the man's situation properly, I wouldn't be talking to you like this.
If you were also thinking that perhaps a man who is extremely generous wouldn't be worth mentioning unless there were something otherwise extra-extraordinary about him, you would be absolutely right.
This man had a special gift: a gift of Giving. More than money, or material goods, or leisure time, he could literally give of himself: a rare Giving Man. It was this gift that drove him to help others; it this gift that drove him to ruin.
Imagine, if you will, a child crying for the parents she lost in a fire. The Giving Man could give her a happy, loving memory of his own parents to keep her safe and secure. To a man drinking alone at a bar, the Giving Man could provide the warmth of friendship, to make his night less lonely. If he had wanted to, the Giving Man could have given a blind man sight, or a deaf man hearing, but he had only two eyes, only two ears.
And that was the problem.
Whatever the Giving Man gave, he lost. Memories, feelings, pieces of his soul: all were truly given. He gave up his skin to a child born with a debilitating disease. He gave up his name to a refugee seeking asylum. He gave up his personality and mind to people suffering fractures in theirs. He gave his need to eat to a woman overcoming an eating disorder. By the time his organs were given away, he didn't need them anymore. By the time his identity was given away, there was absolutely nothing left that could be identified as him.
I mean, there was _something_ left. But that something wasn't the Giving Man.
What is a person who isn't anything?
Just a nothing with no control over its life.
That was the last thing the Giving Man gave away: control. It's a terrible thing to lose; even a kind person will crave control once they've truly lost it. All the Giving Man did was what the other man told him to do, and for his naivete, he was punished by becoming nothing.
Oh. I'd almost forgotten there was another person in this story. Was he really a man? I'm still not sure. With what he did, it's probably better to call him a monster. A desperate man seeking his true place in the world will listen to any monster who claims to know the path. He'll do anything the monster says, no matter how bad an influence they turn out to be. And then he'll have nothing.
Strange, to remember so much of the Giving Man but not this other monster…
**Item #:** SCP-3145
**Object Class:** Euclid
**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-3145 is contained in a pair of standard humanoid containment chambers in Site-22. Each chamber is equipped with a double airlock. Personnel entering either chamber must not carry any written narratives.  
Do not let him out.  
Included in the primary chamber is a monitor and keyboard connected to an external computer housed in the secondary chamber. Said computer should have no intranet or internet connections. A full copy of all non-critical SCP object documents from the Foundation Object Database is to be maintained on the external computer, and refreshed and updated weekly via USB drive. Documents modified by SCP-3145 should be stored for review by the on-site psychologist.  
He deserves nothing but suffering.  
**Description:** SCP-3145 cannot be described. Individuals interacting with SCP-3145 are unable to provide any details about its identity to third parties, even with application of mnestics. All that is known about SCP-3145 is that it is an entity not much larger than an average human, that it is sapient and capable of speech, and that the designation "SCP-3145" can be used to identify it. It is not certain whether SCP-3145 has a physical form, though there does seem to be a movable locus from which its effects originate, with a maximum range limited by what a human with 20/20 vision would be able to easily see from that location.  
He is nothing.  
SCP-3145 has the ability to permanently alter written narratives by replacing one of the characters, typically the main character, with itself. According to SCP-3145, it lives out the events depicted in these narratives while altering them, and this act gives it a sense of identity that it otherwise lacks. The veracity of this statement cannot be ascertained, as SCP-3145 has been known to feign muteness when it does not wish to interact with personnel, and its presence within its containment chamber generally cannot be fully known. It is only possible to ascertain whether or not SCP-3145 is currently 'inhabiting' a text by observing the alterations as they occur; at no time has it communicated verbally with personnel while altering text.  
Do you have any idea what he made me do?  
SCP-3145 shows a preference for shorter narratives, stating that novel-length narratives are much more tiring to alter fully. SCP-3145 is able to alter both digital and printed texts, but claims the process is easiest when provided digital text and a keyboard. Despite this, manipulation of keys by SCP-3145 has never been observed.  
I was something, but he took that from me.  
Currently, SCP-3145 is being treated for depression and a unique disorder involving severe amnesia in relation to its origins and identity. Allowing SCP-3145 access to narratives for alteration has been shown to improve its mood, though the positive effect has lessened during the course of its containment. Though it is believed emotional instability makes SCP-3145 more tractable, psychological treatment is ongoing. To date, no escape attempt by SCP-3145 has been successful.  
He turned me inside out.  
**Discovery:** SCP-3145 was first encountered on 04/02/2017 after changes had been observed in the documentation for numerous Keter-class objects, necessitating restoration from database backup. SCP-3145 was first contacted while altering the text of [SCP-173](/scp-173), initially by typing in the document, and later through verbal communication, at which point it was convinced of the necessity for keeping the Foundation's database secure and agreed to be contained in exchange for further access to object documentation.  
He made me betray the one thing that made me who I was.  
**Addendum: Interview 3145-15**  
I just wanted to have a purpose.
> **Interviewed:** SCP-3145  
>  I was so naive.  
>  **Interviewer:** Dr. Westfall, Site-22 Psychologist  
>  When you hardly understand yourself, it's hard to know who to trust.  
>  **Foreword:** Routine psychological evaluation conducted 05/08/2017.  
>  What other choice did I have?  
>  **< Begin Log, 18:31>**  
>  When I realized, too late, what he'd done, I had to do something.  
>  **Westfall:** Are you ready to begin our session, SCP-3145?  
>  Do you understand what it's like, being nothing?  
>  **SCP-3145:** I'm here.  
>  It's worse than hell.  
>  **Westfall:** All right. How have you been feeling lately?  
>  There was only enough left of myself to know what I'd lost.  
>  **SCP-3145:** Not too bad, I guess. Some of the articles you gave me are kinda… Weird. I mean, some aren't as fun to be as others. That goes without saying, maybe. I'm still enjoying going back to the old ones every now and then.  
>  I took it back.  
>  **Westfall:** I notice you spend a lot of time in the articles that involve killing people. Does killing make you feel good?  
>  Not all of it. That wasn't in my nature.  
>  **SCP-3145:** Yeah, kinda. I mean, uh, it makes me feel powerful, I guess?  
>  But enough that I could have a 'me' again.  
>  **Westfall:** Why is feeling powerful important to you?  
>  I left him with nothing, and for a moment, I was filled with sorrow.  
>  **SCP-3145:** Do you have to ask? I mean, I can't actually do anything in the, the real world. So if I can control stuff in there, in the story, it's a nice change.  
>  I saw him as a man, reduced to what I had been. I couldn't help sympathizing.  
>  **Westfall:** Do you want to harm people in the real world?  
>  All it took was remembering what he had driven me to.  
>  **SCP-3145:** I don't know. Not really, I guess. I mean, everyone I talk to here has been pretty decent, or at least not enough of an asshole for me to want to kill them. You guys give me good stories to play with. I guess I like being able to do it, to kill, in the stories because there's no consequences.  
>  I was overcome with rage.  
>  **Westfall:** I see.  
>  I was something, but I still wasn't really me.  
>  **SCP-3145:** Can we change the subject?  
>  I never would be me.  
>  **Westfall:** Of course. There is one thing I wanted to ask you, if you feel like talking about it.  
>  I had lost everything a second time.  
>  **SCP-3145:** What's that?  
>  I would have my revenge.  
>  **Westfall:** I wondered if you could tell me about Falzon.  
>  …Hey now, we can't have you spoiling the surprise.  
>  **Westfall:** SCP-3145?  
>  No, stop.  
>  **SCP-3145:** Sorry, who?  
>  Nothing you need worry about.  
>  **[DATA LOST]**  
>  Ha ha ha.  
>  **SCP-3145:** Uh, I don't actually know what that is, sorry.  
>  Well, anyway.  
>  **Westfall:** It's a name we frequently see appear in the articles you alter. I wanted to know if it was a creation of yours. Perhaps an original character?  
>  It's frightening, what they do here.  
>  **SCP-3145:** Can't say I've heard the name before.  
>  But I made an oath to myself.  
>  **Westfall:** When this person appears, they seem determined to belittle and torment you.  
>  To whatever part of me was still a person.  
>  **SCP-3145:** Um… Can we talk about something else?  
>  If he and I were to suffer the same fate, I would ensure he suffers more.  
>  **Westfall:** If I've made you uncomfortable, I apologize.  
>  And it turns out, I'm rather good at that.  
>  **SCP-3145:** It's nothing, it's okay. I'm okay.  
>  I miss the old me sometimes.  
>  **Westfall:** Of course. That was actually all I wanted to talk about today. Unless there was anything more you wanted to cover?  
>  But only sometimes.  
>  **SCP-3145:** No, that's fine. See you next week?  
>  I've taken a nose for an eye, and that's something.  
>  **Westfall:** Next week, then.  
>  It's better than nothing.  
>  **< End Log, 18:51>**  
>  And isn't it better to have a little control than none at all?  
>  **Closing Statement:** I believe Falzon may be a symptom of the disassociation SCP-3145 feels in regards to its identity, a construct created with an aim of self-flagellation, though the reasons as to why will require deeper probing. Even in the case, as my superiors posit, that Falzon is a separate entity, it does not seem to be able to act independently of SCP-3145. I will endeavor to provide the best mental care I can, but the limitations imposed by SCP-3145's own condition both make interacting with it difficult at best and prevent it from living life as fully as I think it wants to. -Dr. Patricia Westfall
It doesn't matter, I suppose.
I'm in here, too.
I'm the one in control.
And I'm not going anywhere.
