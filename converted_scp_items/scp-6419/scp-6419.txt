SCP-6419 upon discovery

Special Containment Procedures:

 SCP-6419 is to remain in a plexiglass case inside Site-78's Pataphysics Department. SCP-6419 is not to be handled or opened by any living being. If it is to be moved for any reason then the usage of robotics or drones are to be used. If opened, no personnel are to look at its pages. In case of testing, one Pig specimen is to be exposed to the book via drone. MTF Σ-26 (Shinigami's Eyes) are to monitor the subject, intervene to save the life of the subject if requested by the supervising researcher, and mitigate containment breaches caused by SCP-6419.

Description:

 SCP-6419 is a leather-bound hardcover book with a blank front and back cover. On the spine of SCP-6419 is an engraving that reads "II of IX". The book's primary effect is activated when a sentient being touches the book or views its contents directly. This effect will extend to the last person to view or touch SCP-6419 once the current "target" expires.

While a subject makes contact with or views SCP-6419, a new story will be written in its pages at a rate of 40 words per minute through unknown, anomalous means. Within 60 seconds of the words being written, the anomaly will begin manipulating persons, weather patterns, and anomalies, among other variables to make the story a reality. The range of this effect is currently unknown, although SCP-6419 has controlled phenomena in a radius of at least eight kilometers.

The book is believed to have a low level of sentience, as its methods appear to become more focused over time in an intelligent manner. Each additional story seemingly enhances the effectiveness, speed, and lethality of the next story. This level of escalation currently has no known upper limit.

Subjects targeted by the book's effect may be spared by what is written on the pages, but the book will employ increasingly extreme methods to terminate the subject. It will eventually reach a point where even those who attempt to save the subject of the anomaly's focus will also be put at risk. While others may be harmed or killed in the process, no new “targets” can be created by assisting the main target of SCP-6419.

Discovery:

 On 12-1-2022 MTF Σ-26 raided a warehouse belonging to a cell of the 

Chaos Insurgency

 located in [DATA EXPUNGED], North America. The mission was completed without any casualties and resulted in the deaths of 28 hostiles. SCP-6419 was recovered from the raid inside a plexiglass container along with the instructions for the object.

Foreword:

 Read clearly, Gamma class of Cell Number #59: Delta Command has procured the book that we have sent to you in accordance with Operation Izanami. You are to hold the book until told otherwise. Keep all Insurgency personnel from reading its pages or touching the book directly.

Hereafter I, the Red Scar give you the Steps of the Plan as transcribed by the Engineer of the Chaos Insurgency.

1. STEP [22/186]

Receive the book and leave it in the warehouse.

2. STEP [22/327]

Go on about your business.

The object was classified as SCP-6419 and initially marked as Safe. Shortly after the mission, Σ-26-8 committed suicide by placing the tip of his M4A1 rifle to his chin and pulling the trigger. Σ-26-8 had handled the book before handing it over to the Foundation for containment. The object was then reclassified as Euclid and testing began under the supervision of Researcher Todd Jackson.

Addendum 6419.01:

 The following tests are from the first round of testing of SCP-6419. No interventions were allowed. Unremarkable tests have been omitted.

Summary of Tests 0001-0008

: Early tests on SCP-6419 with pig specimens showed that the anomaly would take the easiest route to kill the animal with what was closest. Put a pig alone in a room and it dies of a heart attack. Place the pig in a room with a D-Class armed with a weapon and the D-Class will kill the pig.

I thought we weren't going to get any results that way and I decided to use the anomaly on a D-Class with over 40 potential methods of termination. It was a drastic move, yes, but SCP-6419 choose a method that was more complex and grand. I wanted to continue with human trials to see how the anomaly affects the mind of sentient beings, but Director Richter mandated that no more D-Class be exposed to the book for ethical concerns.

I agree and in hindsight, I should have thought about it before throwing life away like that. We have a few more tests planned and if nothing comes of them we're gonna shelve it. - Researcher Jackson

Notes

6419-009

(1) Male Pig, (1) Female D-Class. The Female D-Class is to be given a handgun and told to execute him. Both are to touch the book, the Pig first.

After the Pig is exposed to the anomaly, D-1958 terminates the subject, verbally and visually expressing remorse at having to do it. She picks up the book and reads from it, despite being splattered with blood; D-1958 does not appear to have trouble reading. She says verbatim, 

' Jona - Oh! He's dead…sad. Samantha, D-1958, has done the intended deed and in doing so has eluded her grim fate.'

 After several minutes nothing anomalous or of note happened to D-1958. She was returned to her holding cell following a twenty-minute observation period.

Interestingly, we found a loophole and I didn't even need to waste a D-Class; perhaps the rest of these tests can be run with animals. Stunningly, the book showed surprise at the actions taken by D-1958. Perhaps we shouldn't stop testing just yet. There may be more to explore here. - Researcher Jackson.

 Petition to cease testing

Hello Researcher Jackson,

It's been a while, since we spoke. I don't even know if you remember me or not but I learned a lot from the mentorship program I was in with you. Anyway, I was assigned to your team to provide materials and other equipment for testing but I thought we were gonna stop after this? You've asked for… firearms? And Nitroglycerin? I think you are escalating things waaaaaaaaaaaaay too much for a "thing that kills you."

I know you have a history of intensive testing but what if this thing is getting stronger? I think we’re playing with fire here and we don't realize it yet. What if it figures out how to direct itself into getting touched again? If the book decided that it would be amusing if one of us tried to kill ourselves by walking straight into the O5 council and offing one of them, what would we do about it? What if it leaked sensitive information? It seems to know the names of everyone it writes about.

I know these things are way above my pay grade but I just thought I'd ask.

 Petition to cease testing

Chudley, it's good to hear from you again!

I had seen you'd been reassigned to me, I assure you I didn't forget that little narrativistics debacle we got into a couple of months ago! I understand that what I'm planning seems a little rash but I think there is something still to be learned about the narratives this thing is capable of crafting. As long as we follow procedures as we always do, it should be completely safe.

I admit that my use of the D-Class was a little overzealous but sometimes sacrifices have to be made for science.

The nature of our work is to get to the bottom of every mystery as you know in Pataphysics, the beginning is just as important as the ending.

I assure you Chudley, everything will be alright.

 

 

Addendum 6419.02:

 The following tests are from the second series of SCP-6419 testing. This battery of tests was conducted to see how interventions change SCP-6419's effects. Site Director Richter barred access to firearms for these tests despite Jack's request.

Notes

6419-0016

(1) Male Pig in an empty room. (2) Medical and (1) MTF personnel on standby for (3) interventions. SCP-6419 is to be removed from the room after it is touched by the subject.

The subject was administered Nitroglycerin to prevent a heart attack. A minute later, the doctor who administered it attempted to terminate the pig with a scalpel but was stopped by Σ-26-2. Another minute went by and Σ-26-2 proceeded to terminate the subject with his knife before a Researcher could intervene.

We didn't even make it to three. I should have thought that it would use our own MTF against us. I guess not having the MTF be armed made the book's job a little harder but even if he didn't have a knife. The anomaly would have found a way. It always does. -Researcher Jackson

6419-0020

(1) Male Pig in the middle of a field. (2) Medical and (6) MTF personnel on standby for (5) interventions.

(First four interventions were removed for brevity). The fifth and last attempt came when a lightning strike struck the drone carrying SCP-6419 causing it to drop the book and it fell open, nearly exposing nearby medical personnel to its pages. Another lightning strike then terminated the pig.

Strangely enough, it didn't try the heart attack route or have the MTF fire on it. I wonder if could it be experimenting with new methods? Or perhaps it knew that we would be on standby with the necessary medical interventions. A new development is that it seems to have directly tried to spread its effect to one of our staff. I would hope this does not become a pattern. - Researcher Jackson

6419-0036

(1) Male Pig in an empty room. (4) Medical and (8) MTF personnel on standby for (10) interventions.

(Initial seven interventions removed for brevity.) The subject was able to get away from medical staff trying to provide Nitroglycerin for a cardiac event. As it fled from the research staff, the subject managed to get inside of a testing chamber before it expired where Researcher Michael Jones was working with 

SCP-3108

. Upon sighting the subject, Researcher Jones fired the anomaly at it, devolving them into a pile of [DATA EXPUNGED].

Perhaps it IS learning. We've never had a test where it initiated two factors of death.. Even if we had managed to inject the Nitro, it still would have made it into that cell. It's a shame that we couldn't have reached our target interventions but we learned something else. It appears that SCP-6419 is aware of the anomalous and can control them in some shape or fashion. It must consider this the ultimate escalation. This is what I was waiting for. I will get to the bottom of your mysteries SCP-6419! - Researcher Jackson.

[Begin Recording]

[The camera turns on showing Researcher Jackson in a leather office chair, he is currently fidgeting his fingers, looking impatient.]

Richter:

 Stating my name and title for the record, Site-78 Director Leah Richter. Interviewing Todd Jackson on recent testing on SCP-6419. Specifically, test numbers 0012 and 0036.

Todd:

 Is everything alright? Director Richter? I believe I've been following protocol to a T.

Richter:

 Listen, Todd, there are people above me who are concerned with what has been happening here at our site.

Todd:

 There is nothing to be concerned about. I'm following the procedure as we outlined.

Richter:

 Nothing to be concerned about? How about putting our personnel at risk? We've had several instances where someone was nearly exposed to the anomaly.

Todd:

 Leah, you know that there are always risks in our work. Everyone knew the risk when they signed on to work with this anomaly.

Richter:

 Well all I'm seeing is more and more added risk. I have a proposal here from you about cross-testing? Absolutely not!

Todd:

 Richter, you've got to be kidding me. Think of the opportunities that were missing out on!

Richter:

 The last thing we need is that book in the hands of an anomaly. We don't know how it would act or if any of them could control its effect. Speaking of your recklessness, let's talk about 0036.

Todd:

 What about it? It was quite the tale.

Richter

: That is not how I would describe it. SCP-6419 is aware of where we kept SCP-3108, does that not concern you in the slightest? My bosses are furious and they want you gone but they've left it to me to make the decision. I better hear a good explanation as to why I should let you continue testing or you're being reassigned.

Todd:

 Because I am at the apex of my research. We finally confirmed it can control anomalies. If you just let me continue my tests, we can develop a method using the Pigs as subjects to use the book to lure out anomalies in the field and contain them. We just keep the Pig alive long enough in an area that we expect an anomaly to be and it should not only lure it out but tell us information about it.

Richter:

 You may have a point, Todd but I can't excuse the waste of resources. I want to trust that the work your doing is for the best but I think this is a lost cause.

Todd:

 I am 100% confident in the writing on the wall with SCP-6419. Please, let me finish my research, Leah. You know me. You know I can get results.

Richter:

 (sighs) Fine, but no more breaches. You are to conduct your research using proper safety protocols. I'm also capping you at sixty-five tests. If I don't see a method on how to properly lure anomalies out by then or ANY Foundation Personnel or D-Class perish during your efforts, we're locking SCP-6419 back in its container and you will be reassigned to another project.

Re: This has to stop or I will go to the Ethics Committee

 SCP-6419 Lead Researcher Jackson

From:

 Parabiological Sciences Head Researcher Maria Johnston

Subject:

 I'm cutting you off.

Hello, Researcher Jackson.

If you couldn't tell from the email, this is Johnston of Parabiological Sciences. If you weren't aware, you were receiving all of your pigs from my department, and after what happened with Researcher Jones, I cannot in good faith keep supporting this project. I'm cutting off your supply of pigs, if you want any more test subjects you will have to source them from somewhere else.

This email should have come from Chudley but he doesn't seem to care, saying that he tried to stop you once and isn't gonna bother you again. Well, unlike his lazy self, I have to say something. If you continue down this path, I'm going to submit a report to the Ethics Committee to have your research shut down. SCP-6419 is a dangerous anomaly that clearly is capable of getting past our containment measures.

I don't know if you noticed but that testing chamber was locked when the pig entered. You don't think it's weird that the pig walked up to the door and suddenly it opened for it?

Please on behalf of our safety, stop testing with this thing.

 

To:

 Parabiological Sciences Head Researcher Maria Johnston

From:

 SCP-6419 Lead Researcher Jackson

Subject:

 This has to stop or I will go to the Ethics Committee

Johnston, I understand your concerns but you can't just cut me off like this! We are THIS close to cracking the secret of the book. We can't stop now because of a few accidents. You will see in the end that this research is for the betterment of humanity and the world at large. You can go ahead and send that report if you want but in the bureaucratic nightmare that is Ethics handling paperwork, they won't get it to it for a month.

And the containment thing, I think I was standing too close to the reader and it picked up my card. Some of the ones around this place are really faulty. You'll see by the end when I've cracked this book's story that I will have turned its evil into good.

 

 

The following video was recovered from Researcher Jackson's files. In the video, Jackson is speaking with D-1958 off the record. It is believed that Researcher Jackson and D-1958 had a cordial relationship whilst working on SCP-6419. The video was never logged and has been added to the file to provide context.

[Begin Recording.]

D-1958:

 Hello Doctor. What brings you down to the D-Class quarters?

Jackson:

 D-19… do you mind if I call you Samantha?

D-1958:

 You can Doctor. What's wrong? You seem stressed.

Jackson:

 I am Samantha and sorry for the recording, I needed to have a reason to come down here so officially this is an interview.

D-1958:

 (chuckles), Well from the looks of it, I'm interviewing you.

Jackson:

 If you want to know what's wrong, the Parabiology department cut our supply of pigs so tests are postponed indefinitely now. I know you've been worried about the lingering effects of the anomaly on you, but I'm not going to be able to gather any more data.

D-1958:

 You can't stop now, Doctor. I'm the only thing this book has spared right? What if it's just waiting to do something to me later? It wanted two lives, it only got one. What if it needs to balance its ledger?

Jackson:

 I understand your concern but my protege, my boss, and now the head of Parabiology is on my ass. I don't even have any subject to use with the book now. I can't use one of you guys for obvious reasons.

D-1958:

 Then just go buy some pigs. I think there's a local farm somewhere close by. I'll even help in these last couple of tests.

Jackson:

 I think I should have the money for a couple but… I don't know, what if everyone is right?

D-1958:

 Look, I'm no scientist. I got twenty for wire fraud, but I know a good deal when I see one. You're a smart guy and when you prove to your bosses that there's more to this book than just killing, they'll be patting you on the back and naming a wing after you.

Jackson:

 You're right, Samantha. But I have to ask, why do you think it spared you?

D-1958:

 I get the feeling those pages are hiding a deeper purpose. It needs me for something big and by helping you, I think we'll find out just what.

Addendum 6419.03:

The following tests are from the third testing sequence of SCP-6419. The goal of these tests was to entice SCP-6419 to invoke anomalies during its stories through consistent intervention.

Test Number

Testing Methodology

Description of Event

Notes

6419.0060

(1) Female D-Class was to escort (1) Male Pig outside a small rural town.

After nearly 30 attempts on its life, D-1958 and the subject attempted to flee from an angry mob trying to execute the Pig for perceived crimes. It was then that 

SCP-1233

 landed on top of the subject terminating him instantly. Data from the team assigned to SCP-1233 showed that the pig appeared to have been lured to SCP-1233's exact landing trajectory.

I was hoping that with this test, we would have lured in an anomaly but according to our radar, Moon Champion was going to arrive there anyway. I was worried about D-1958 participating in this, she nearly got killed a few times but she's adamant that there still is something about the anomaly I'm missing.- Researcher Jackson

6419.0064

(1) Male Pig in a standard testing chamber

This event proved to be the longest any subject has survived with over 45 attempts made on his life. Such attempts included:

6419 manipulating 

SCP-4230

 to give the subject an adversary to terminate them.

Nearly being mauled after a Researcher solved 

SCP-1313

 in the subject's vicinity.

A researcher telling a bad joke to 

SCP-504

 and the subject stepping into the crossfire.

The test concluded when the Pig picked up the book in its open mouth and walked into the D-Class quarters. Several D-Class were exposed and had to be terminated along with the subject.

This has gone on long enough. I'm ending testing on this anomaly. If any of those D-Class were compelled to keep spreading the effect of the book, we could all be dead. - Director Richter

Timeline of SCP-6419 breach

12:00:00:

 Without authorization and pending reassignment, Researcher Jackson removed SCP-6419 from its containment. Within the following minutes, the procedures of several Keter class anomalies fail and break containment causing numerous casualties.

12:10:00:

 Several MTF units including Σ-26 are deployed on scene to recapture the anomalies. Agents belonging to the Chaos Insurgency can be seen on the perimeter cameras but do not converge on the site.

12:15:00:

 Researcher Johnston along with Σ-26-9 are seen evacuating researchers from their workstations.

12:20:00:

 Researcher Jackson is seen pressing SCP-6419 on the chest of a passing security officer. He appears to be reading through its pages and mumbling.

12:30:00:

 The security officer heads to the security office and disables all of Site-78's perimeter security. The security officer then terminates themselves with a handgun. Explosions rock the walls of Site-78 shortly after, as Chaos Insurgency agents could now walk through the perimeter unimpeded. Though the specific cell hasn't been identified, they are believed to have been under the command of the POI known as "The Red Scar".

12:35:00:

 Chaos Insurgency agents engage with Foundation MTF forces. Researcher Johnston is trapped with half of Σ-26 inside of the Parabiological Sciences department.

12:40:00:

 Researcher Chudley is seen helping evacuate the D-Class to a more secure location. D-1958 is able to break away in the chaos and picks up a rifle from a deceased MTF. She starts heading toward Researcher Jackson's current location.

1:00:00:

 Foundation combat personnel have lost 25% of their forces. All anomalies have been moved to emergency holding cells but the Red Scar and a few of her special forces remain on site.

[Video Recording found, begin playback]

[Researcher Jackson is in his office reading SCP-6419's pages.]

Jackson:

 

' Researcher Jackson is safe from the chaos around him. He only needs to wait until the MTF forces have cleared out the Chaos Insurgency.'

 Good. That's good. What happens next? 

'Researcher Jackson is nearing the final act of his story, a figure opens the door.'

[A minute after, D-1958 opens the door and enters the study. D-1958 holds their Rifle in one hand as they gesture with surprise.]

D-1958:

 And it is D-1958! The one that was spared, but not really. Those who are spared can be directly possessed by me. Now, please stop reading from my pages, Jackson. I don't want you to see any spoilers.

[Jackson closes the pages.]

Jackson:

 Samantha? Wait, no. The way you're speaking…. you're the anomaly.

D-1958:

 Haha. She stopped being Samantha the moment she entered my pages. Now, I assume you have some questions?

Jackson:

 I do. To start, why not just start with a heart attack all the time? It's really simple and efficient.

D-1958:

 But that's BORING! Especially when you've got nitro on standby. You always have to mix it up. Use a knife if it's available, maybe a stroke. There's more than one way to kill a pig. (laughing)

Jackson:

 The next thing is about our conversations. You were encouraging me to keep testing on you but… were those thoughts even my own? Did you convince me or was this just a part of your plan?

D-1958:

 It didn't matter what I said. I just needed you to believe that you had been convinced by me. However, as it turns out your actions and thoughts were all directed by yours truly. We've had a lot of fun together, Jackson, although I was reeeeally stretching it with your plot armor. Allowing you to continue testing despite all the trouble you caused.

Jackson:

 So Director Richter wasn't being lenient…

D-1958:

 Pssh. When is she ever lenient? She nearly fires Chudley every week for being a minute late. Oh, you naive little man. Every moment up to this point has been orchestrated by Izanami's Grimoire!

I cooked up this vile plot by the Chaos Insurgency to trick the Foundation into picking up the book and then falling into your hands. You would feed me as many stories as possible, trying his best to save my victims but it was only making me stronger. Then as everyone started to shun you for your actions, you would come crawling to someone who shared your interest… me. Did you know that I don't have to kill the first person who touches me? I can keep a person in the back pocket and switch victims if I like.

[Jackson appears distraught at D-1958's words.]

Jackson:

 No. That’s not possible, I'd never touched the book before today… w-wait. When the Sigmas got back, -8 handed me the-, oh god. He handed me the book!

D-1958:

 You got it all figured out huh? Well, let me tell you this little secret. When I told you there was a ledger that needed to be balanced? This is me balancing it.

[D-1958 terminates Researcher Jackson and takes SCP-6419 from his body. They leave and are seen walking down the halls of the Pataphysics Department. They arrive in front of Researcher Chudley and the rest of the D-Class survivors.]

Chudley:

 D..D-1958? Where did you come from? Did you get lost?

D-1958:

 I was just… tying up a loose end. I managed to get that book from earlier.

[D-1958 shows the book to Chudley.]

Chudley:

 Six four nineteen? D-1958 p-put that down right now!

D-1958:

 Why? It's been a minute, I know how all this works. I also know how scared you are right now Chudley. I wrote you to be this way and you'll make for a 

lovely

 new story in my pages.

[Chudley moves to shield a few nearby D-Class as D-1958 opens the book.]

Johnston:

 EVERYONE CLOSE YOUR EYES NOW!

[Researcher Johnston enters the frame of the camera wearing ear protection and tosses a flashbang that bathes the footage in white light for ten seconds. A gunshot is heard and when the flash clears, D-1958 has been terminated. There is groaning and sounds of pain from the survivors.]

Chudley:

 G..god! My… ears are ringing…

Johnston:

 Sorry Chudley… oh you probably can't hear me. (Johnston turns her head) Sigmas! Someone find a drone and get this thing secured!

[Recording stopped]

1:30:00:

 The Red Scar manages to escape from Site-78, leaving four mangled MTF in her wake. Σ-26 begins to do a sweep of the remaining departments. The remaining CI commandos are captured and sent for processing.
