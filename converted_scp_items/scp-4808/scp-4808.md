**Addendum:** Incident Report
PoI-3281[3](javascript:;) was found dead in their home due to self-termination by hanging. An instance of SCP-4808-1 appeared; however, its throat was slit and the specimen was dead. Investigation of PoI-3281's apartment found several other suicide implements, all broken. PoI-3281's suicide note is as follows:
> It's all a joke, just a long, unfulfilling joke. The punchline isn't worth it. No matter what, it never will be. Why not just cut it short?
> If my entire life is a joke, it's not even a good one.
