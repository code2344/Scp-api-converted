Following the events of incident 8696-A-1, I have stepped down from my position as the leader of SCP-8696’s research team. I firmly believe that, despite his imperfections, Dr. Herkko Käämioja is more deserving of this responsibility and honor. Please keep in mind that all future research and material will be led and written by him.

**Item #:** SCP-8696
**Object Class:** Euclid
![SCP1.jpg](https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-8696/SCP1.jpg)
A portion of SCP-8696 at the entrance of its nest, clad in black pants and decorated sneakers.
**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-8696 is to be remotely surveilled via live camera feed and the hole it resides in shall remain unobstructed. School faculty have been instructed to forbid students from tampering with its nest, due to its “connection to the wiring within the building.”
SCP-8696 remains mostly immobile and does not showcase hostile behavior unless provoked to do so. In order to prevent further accidents, approaching the being is strictly forbidden. Evacuation of the building for future testing has been planned under the guise of a "large scale remodeling."
**Description:** SCP-8696 is a large living mass covered entirely with human limbs. Due to its concealed nature, SCP-8696's size is difficult to estimate, but it is large enough to envelop a human being inside of itself with little to no strain. Its limbs are covered in various pieces of clothing, and the items usually correspond with the limbs they are on (i.e. arms in shirts and legs in pants).
SCP-8696 is currently located on the lowest floor of the [REDACTED] school of visual arts in Helsinki, Finland. The school cafeteria’s eastern wall has a rectangular opening, which leads to a short, vertical passage within the concrete. The space beyond it is referred to as SCP-8696’s “nest.”
SCP-8696 came to the Foundation’s attention on 29/6/2024 after police received reports of a possible squatter living within the school walls during summer vacation. Field agent/researcher Herkko Käämioja was assigned to investigate the area. Once Dr. Käämioja became sure of SCP-8696's anomalous nature, he delayed any further research in order to receive suitable equipment and backup. Due to delays pertaining to the Finnish postage system, this took longer than expected.
**Addendum 8696-01:** Before any initial experiments could be conducted, the cafeteria SCP-8696 is located in underwent renovations without the Foundation's knowledge. (Dr. Käämioja has received penalties for failing to survey the area adequately.) Though the space had noticeable changes, such as the removal of the green counter under the nests opening, the passage itself remained seemingly unchanged.

[BEGIN LOG]
**Dr. Käämioja:** Okay, you ready Press? Mh, so a good way to invite this thing out is to…
_Dr. Käämioja reaches down to grab a sheet of plywood off the floor._
**Dr. Käämioja:** Block the nest! Just some duct tape should do, it's not like we actually want to trap the thing.
_Dr. Käämioja takes a roll of tape out of his pocket and holds the plywood in place, covering the opening entirety. He struggles for around half a minute, but eventually manages to rip off two long strips of tape with his free hand and teeth. He places them across the board, securing it in place._
**Dr. Käämioja:** Now we give it a moment. We’ve got all night…
_Dr. Käämioja knocks on the plywood in a playful manner. A sigh can be heard from behind the camera._
_After 20 seconds, the taped piece of plywood begins to shift, straining away from the opening. The duct tape rips off and SCP-8696 can be seen, as a pair of legs kicks the blockage down and relaxes as it falls to the floor._
**Dr. Käämioja:** There you are! I mean, it is here. Can’t tell if it’s a you or an it yet, but that’s what we’re here for, right! It’s got weird taste. So many chains and patches-
**Dr. Press:** (Behind camera) Just get on with it.
_Dr. Käämioja raises his eyebrow at Dr. Press, then turns to face SCP-8696. He dons a pair of rubber gloves._
**Dr. Käämioja:** *cough* Now, from what I’ve seen and measured, it should be safe to touch… Famous last words.
_Dr. Käämioja places his left hand on one of SCP-8696's legs. It does not react to his touch, and he is visibly relaxed by the fact._
**Dr. Käämioja:** So, let’s take a peek under these clothes.
_Dr Käämioja. grabs onto a pair of ripped black jeans on SCP-8696 and pauses before pulling them down._
**Dr. Käämioja:** By the way, sorry if I ramble Press. I just try to keep a light mood. I’m a bit on edge to be truthful, and talking helps to keep people calm. And animals. Perhaps anomalies too.
**Dr. Press:** True. Sorry, I've gotten used to the way Dr. Cattail handles things.
**Dr. Käämioja:** Ah, I know. The man is a brick wall.
_Dr. Käämioja pulls the garment down to the limbs knees and points his flashlight at the exposed skin. The sudden glow makes SCP-8696 recoil slightly. He examines it, tracing the surface sheepishly with his index finger. As he works, more of the creature emerges and several more pairs of arms and legs become visible._
**Dr. Käämioja:** Hm. Acts like human skin would, but this thing is all limbs. No genitals between these or anything.
**Dr. Press:** *chuckle*…that's an odd thing to focus on.
**Dr. Käämioja:** Hey, what else would you expect to find between a pair of legs?! Speaking of, how do they look from back there? Anything cool?
**Dr. Press:** I guess not. They swing around seemingly at random, but they’re pretty limp at the moment…
_Dr. Käämioja continues to scan the being, pulling and pressing on the limbs. They move slowly and idly, clearly alive but lacking any kind of objection. A drop of sweat runs down his brow._
**Dr. Käämioja:** Summer is just the worst. Could be worse, I guess. My friends took me with them to the Tenerife back in university, and that was more like the worst. I sweat like a pig… fried like one too, really! I pity you in the states.
**Dr. Press:** Mh. The climate is certainly different… uhh, it’s not hot everywhere though. The north is only around eighty degrees or so.
_While Dr. Käämioja is distracted, a pair of hands pulls the ripped pants back up on the legs._
**Dr. Käämioja:** Eighty?
**Dr. Press:** …In fahrenheit, doctor. That would only be around 26 degrees for you.
**Dr. Käämioja:** Eugh, point stands. That’s hot… Did you convert that in your head? Sharp mind, Press. You im-**Press** me.
**Dr. Press:** Thanks K. Either way, what are your findings?
_Dr. Käämioja counts the arms and legs quietly to himself, inspecting both the clothing and the flesh underneath them. He then returns to the very first legs he analyzed, noticing the pants he pulled down earlier have returned to their original position. He removes his rubber gloves and wipes his palms on the back of his lab coat._
**Dr. Käämioja:** Alright, there is around the same amount of arm and leg here. I could feel a slow pulse, maybe 50 bpm, and the fingers have prints.
**Dr. Press:** Mh. Good, seems like everything's going o-**K**.
**Dr. Käämioja:** Hah!! Good one. I wanna see the base closer now, the limbs are so tightly packed… If I just pull these off, it’ll be easier. Let me…
_Dr. Käämioja begins tugging on the black jeans. He struggles to get them past the ankles, as SCP-8696 protests by turning them into an inopportune angle. The other limbs have gone completely rigid, hardly moving at all._
**Dr. Press:** Hey, look-
_Before Dr. Press can finish her sentence, Dr. Käämioja manages to pry the garment off. He makes a celebratory grunting sound and displays it to the camera. The mass of extremities before him springs into motion, as SCP-8696 grabs onto him. Numerous hands tug at his shirt, arms and the black pants within his grasp, and thighs wrap around his abdomen and neck. SCP-8696 withdraws deep into its nest, dragging a startled Käämioja inside with it._
**Dr. Press:** Oh my god, no!! K? K, are you okay!? K!!
_Unintelligible screaming and cries for help can be heard. Dr. Press comes into view as she rushes to the nest's opening. She peeks inside of the shaft and looks back at the camera, grabbing it by the stand and carefully pushing it inside the narrow space. The pitch black nest is illuminated as the on-camera light is activated._
_A small room is revealed with SCP-8696 in the corner, taking up most of the space. Dr. Käämioja’s muffled vocalizations become more clear. His screams are interspersed with bouts of strained laughter, covered by the sound of rustling fabric and jingling buckles. The creature doesn’t react to the camera's presence, having formed into a ball-like shape completely enveloping Dr. Käämioja. Its arms and legs squirm, kick and wave as it shifts, seemingly turning itself inside out once or twice._
_After around two minutes, all noise subsides and SCP-8696 becomes stationary. Dr. Press pulls the camera out with shaky hands and points it at herself, examining the lens. She closes her eyes and takes a few deep breaths, then looks at her watch._
**Dr. Press:** P-presumed time of death… holy shit!
_The camera turns as Dr. Käämioja emerges once more. He tumbles down from the shaft and lands on the floor, toppling over several chairs. He is shaken, but physically unharmed. The set of clothing he is wearing has changed drastically, going from a lab coat, short sleeved sweater and denim pants, into the previously seen black jeans, a pair of combat boots and a graphic tee. His glasses are nowhere to be found._
[END LOG]
**Addendum 8696-02:** Shortly after the incident in the school cafeteria (10/7/2024), Dr. Käämioja (now designated as SCP-8696-A) sprouted a new arm on top of his left shoulder. The appendage started off small, resembling the arm of an infant. It grew at an alarmingly fast rate, as according to SCP-8696-A, it began as a small lump which expanded overnight. In a symmetrical position to the new extremity, his right shoulder began to form a similar lump. Following this discovery, Dr. Käämioja’s office was moved into a humanoid containment chamber for easier observation.
After six days of waiting, SCP-8696-A grew a full sized pair of arms above his already existing ones. Said appendages look identical to his natural body, even having matching fingerprints and patterns of body hair. They are fully articulated, if a bit less dexterous than his natural ones. Testing tactile activities like writing and crocheting has yielded clumsy results.
Dr. Käämioja has been permitted to keep working as normal, with some adjustments. He is not allowed outside of the facility and will no longer partake in field research. Dr. Käämioja has not displayed any danger towards others, and experiments utilizing class-D personnel have shown no risk of Dr. Käämioja spreading his ailment.

> **Interviewed:** [Dr. Herkko Käämioja]
> **Interviewer:** [Dr. Ivan Cattail]
> **Foreword:** [Interview was conducted shortly after Dr. Käämioja's relocation (12/7/2024) to assess his wellbeing.]
> **[[BEGIN LOG]]**
> **Dr. Cattail:** How are you feeling, Dr. K? You seem excited.
> **Dr. Käämioja:** I can’t hide it, huh! I'm sorry, should be professional and all, but I’m happy to have found my own anomaly! I've been chasing duds for long enough, doctor. Like the reindeer with luminescent antlers. It was reflector paint!
> **Dr. Cattail:** I’m glad you have found something positive in this, but we’re not here to discuss career milestones. How are you feeling, physically and mentally?
> **Dr. Käämioja:** Eh- yes. Pretty good! Comfortable enough seeing my situation, though this room is dull. Could I maybe get a plant or something? All I have is my crochet project.
> **Dr. Cattail:** *sigh* Let's stay on topic K. I apologize for your admittedly hasty relocation, but we will discuss amenities and embellishments soon. Now, your new arms, do they cause you any discomfort? Physical or mental.
> **Dr. Käämioja:** Oh, not really. They are convenient actually, get things done! I can brush my teeth, button my shirt and brush my hair at the same time! Though sometimes it feels they have minds of their own. Or, more like they have something they want. I like them though.
> **Dr. Cattail:** Good, good, I’m glad to hear that. What did you mean by "something they want?" Can you describe the feeling?
> **Dr. Käämioja:** Oh. Well…it’s like…an urge, you know. I do have control, not like something is physically forcing me to do something, but it’s like a… itch that feels good to scratch.
> **Dr. Cattail:** Uh huh. What kinds of urges have you experienced?
> **Dr. Käämioja:** Hmm… well sometimes they wanna scratch. A body part, I mean. And… oh! This morning the one on the left really wanted to play with the button on my pants… sorry, just made sure it's closed now.
> **Dr. Cattail:** I see…
> **< End Log>**
SCP-8696-A has full control of his extra limbs, but reports that they sometimes exhibit 'urges' to do certain tasks. These can range from rather ordinary actions, like squeezing a stress ball or scratching a body part, to harmful ones, like stealing or hitting small objects. Indulging in these urges causes relief, and denying them causes discomfort. The more he indulges, the more new limbs he sprouts.
**Addendum 8696-03:** SCP-8696-A has been requested to keep a log of his urges, whether he indulges in them or not and the effects they have on his body. Full log is available upon request. Note: Despite instructions to use English, Dr. Käämioja wrote his notes entirely in Finnish. Multiple entries also lack significant detail, include unnecessary detail or are left completely empty. Several log entries pertaining to masturbation have been omitted as unnecessarily graphic.
Date and TNU[1](javascript:;) | Time | Urge | Affected limb and Indulgence | Effect  
---|---|---|---|---  
16/7 (TNU: 1) | 13:05 | Do push ups | Both, full | "These things are just as strong as me, that is to say, twenty pushups strong! I could have done more though. Dr. Elm clapped and cheered when he saw me in the hallway and I got all shy… Still, it felt awesome."  
17/7 (TNU: 3) | 10:25 | Draw on whiteboard | Arm Right, full | "I’m left handed, so I was weary of how well it’d go. I drew a little cat, and it turned out really cute. I felt like a proper artist!"  
| 10:53 | Alter previous drawing | Arm Left, full | "I erased the back of the cat. Just felt like the right thing to do. It made me giggle, a cat with just two legs! Haha!"  
| 19:35 | Scratch back | Both, full | God it feels good. Just reaching back and scratching your own back, pure euphoria! Especially when I reached that mosquito bite, GOD!! I swear, I almost [DATA EXPUNGED].  
18/7 (TNU: 3) | 14:15 | Eat second lunch | Arm Left, partial | "I ate some noodles for dinner, but it really wanted me to make another cup. I was so full I couldn’t finish it all, and oddly enough it left a sort of hollow feeling. What a waste."  
19/7 (TNU: ~3) | 16:16 | Spoil surprise | Arm Left, none | "I'm making a lamb plushie for Press. Her wife just had a baby and I wanted to give them something nice. I hide it between my folders when she visits my desk, but the arm wanted to resist. I got a bit anxious after that, like what if she dies before I finish it and she'll never know?!"  
**Arm Back has sprouted.**
20.7 (TNU: 5) | 7:15 | Throw phone | Arm Left, none | "My alarm went off, and it felt like turning it off wasn’t enough for the arm. It made me upset, but alas, my phone survived another day."  
---|---|---|---|---  
| 15:10 | Tap to music | Both Upper Arms, full | "I tapped my fingers on the table at different tempos, and I did it fast too! I listened to ‘Rusketusraidat’ and the left hand followed the drums and the right went with the vocals. Fascinating!"  
21.7 (TNU: 4) | 7:15 | Stir soup | All, full | "I ended up stirring my pot with three ladles! It gets lonely here on the weekends, so I just try to stay occupied. Everyone else is out there, living normal two armed lives. I told them I'd take them out to eat some day, but that's not happening, so this is the next best thing."  
| 9:21 | Hug | Both Upper Arms, none | "Dr. Cattail complimented my soup. I asked him if I could give him a hug, and he looked at me like I insulted his entire family. I guess he's just not that kind of guy, but it made me feel painfully awkward."  
24.7 (TNU: 6) | 13:15 | Weave yarn | Arm Back, full | "I taught Elm and Press to make friendship bracelets. They were so into it, it was like I was back in the children's hospital entertaining bright eyed preteens. I made one too, and considering it was done with one hand and behind my back, I killed it!"  
1.8 (TNU: ~10) | 13:45 | Close light | Arm Left, full | "I’ve been taking a lot of naps lately, but it’s only natural. I have three new arms to feed, that would be taxing for anyone. Just relaxing somewhere dim usually helps."  
| 16:04 | Hold onto bed | Arm Back, full | "I’m not really sure what I should do with the arm on my back, it’s like a weird tail! It’s only good for [DATA EXPUNGED] mostly, but it often wants to grab railings and things. I can do a mean Michael Jackson lean with it. This time it’s just making sure I’m safe."  
| 17:00 | Make new glove | Arm Back, full | "It's August, but this place is getting so chilly! Propably just the ac, but I'll take any excuse for a project. I’ve already made four gloves, so why not get one for the fifth?"  
**Leg Left and Leg Right have sprouted!**  
(In addition to his written logs, Dr. Käämioja has drawn a crude diagram that showcases each new limb and its assigned name.)

A diagram depicting each new extremity and their position on SCP-8696-A's body.
15.8. (TNU: ~20) | 10:10 | Stay in bed | ? | "Dr. Cattail insisted I had to use my new legs right away, but I couldn't bring myself to do it. I said my legs had the urge to stay put, but he didn't believe me. I thought he would drag me out of bed, but I think the glare he gave me was worse."  
---|---|---|---|---  
16.8. (TNU: ~25) | 14:08 | Stay in room | New Legs, none | "I shouldn't have gone out. As soon as I stepped over that doorstep with my freakishly long double-kneed legs, this sinking feeling of dread came over. The room looked so big from up there, like I was really out in the open, vulnerable! I hated it!"  
| 16:04 | Build fort | Arms, hindered | "I wanted to build a pillow fort. Childish, I know, but I just need a temporary shelter. I asked for a new blanket and a few pillows, but Cattail didn't even look at me. Press snuck me a couple anyway, so it's good enough now."  
| 17:58 | Crochet | Full Body, full | "An absolutely mesmerizing experience, my body is like a machine! I used my arms, my feet, my other arms, and hell, even the one on my back got to hold the yarn! All I needed was a warm little nook, and things started looking up again. Call me a thaumaturge because this is a miracle, baby!"  
17.8. (TNU: ?) | 8:00 | Defend fort |  | "Dr. Cattail was adamant that the fort hindered his ability to surveil me. I can't attribute this to just some limb anymore, I feel like I'm dying. Was I unreasonable? I just want somewhere I can be with myself, and this is just too big, too cold. I feel like some child being punished by a strict father."  
| 01:55 | Mourn | ?? | "I can't sleep. I wanted children, I think. Not enough to get off my ass and make something of myself. I don't think I've ever taken anything seriously before. Now that I do, they just don't believe me. Did I cry wolf?"  
20.8. (TNU: ~20) | 6:34 | Stack coffee cups |  | "It's calm and dim at this hour. The cups make a nice array of patterns when you put them together. The tower tipped over and broke one on the floor. The noise almost made me puke."  
| 11 | Hide face | Arm Right, none | "Press said she's worried about me. Really looked in my eyes and said it to my face. I've never feared so much, even after years of working here. Her gaze had me paralyzed. It was so radiant. It hurt."  
|  | Slap Dr. Press | Arm Left, none | "It was distracting, smacking her became all I could think about. I had to keep it in, so I just ended up staring at her. Fuck, she probably thought I was a pervert, hated my guts, but which one is worse?? A weird stare, or 'Excuse me ma'am, may I give you a gentle smackaroo to relieve my urges?'"  
|  |  |  | "Is there anything for me anymore? Is there love or peace somewhere? It's always been like this, just waiting for another distraction."  
|  | Slap self | full | "I took it out, I slapped myself a few times. The gloves were in the way so I had to take them off for a bit. lt felt good afterward though, good job me!"  
21.8. | 8:1 All day |  |  | "It’s so cold constantly. I can’t crochet fast enough to cover myself, and they don’t even give me yarn anymore. I asked them to shut off the ac in my room and they said there was no ac. I took my pillows and blanket and went under the bed but it's so cold."  
22.8. (TNU: ~50?) | 13:00 | nap | hindered | "I don’t understand why he can’t just let me keep the lights off."  
|  | none |  | I'm not getting anything done. I tried doing paperwork but my hands are so fucking sweaty for no reason. I just [UNINTELLIGIBLE]  
24.8. (TNU: ~40) | 15:00 | kick trashcan | Left leg, full | "Something about heat exhaustion, I didn't really listen to Elm. I gave the bin at his office a good kick, and I startled him. It felt so bad seeing him hurt, everything is just empty now."  
|  | steal clothes | none | "They've taken everything. My bed is like a gym mat and all my clothes and blankets are gone. When Cattail showed it all to me, I wanted to rip that fucking polo off him. I didn't, and it hurts so bad. It was the last warm thing I'd see."  
25.8. |  |  |  |   
26.8. |  |  |  |   
27.8. |  |  |  | "I think I have a plan."

**Incident 8696-A-1**
**Date:** (29/8/2024)
**Note:** Recorded by Dr. Evelyn Press.
* * *
[BEGIN LOG]
_Dr. Press enters the kitchen and approaches Dr. Cattail. Her steps are heavy and her breaths are shaky._
**Dr. Press:** Cattail! Listen. He’s gone.
**Dr. Cattail:** What?
**Dr. Press:** K’s not here.
**Dr. Cattail:** Check under the bed, Press.
**Dr. Press:** I did, shithead. He’s not in his room, in the hallways, in the kitchen- I’ve been looking for him all morning! You know, doing your job.
**Dr. Cattail:** What? I-
**Dr. Press:** It’s your fault. You didn’t listen to him.
**Dr. Cattail:** He’s been sleeping for two days! He was there just a few hours ago-
**Dr. Press:** I don’t care if he’s slept for two days or two years, you were supposed to monitor him. I could report you for this you know, neglecting your responsibilities.
_Doctor Cattail raises his hand and opens his mouth to argue, but no words come out. He stops and for a moment, lingering in the silence, before sighing and shaking his head._
**Dr. Press:** Face it Cat, you’re no better than him. I found his logbook, skimmed through the notes and all you’ve done is ignore and belittle him. No, actually you’re worse than K. English isn’t his first language, so at least he’s got one excuse to be incompetent.
_Doctor Elm enters the room. His sudden appearance makes Cattail jump a little._
**Dr. Elm:** Jesus, okay everybody calm down. It’s gonna be fine, we just need to find him. He has to be inside here somewhere, you took away his key after all. I’ve got mine, Press has hers and you’ve got yours, so we’re good!
_Dr. Elm flashes his keycard to the others. Dr. Press pulls out her lanyard and does the same. Dr. Cattail attempts to follow their example, but as he goes through each and every pocket on his person, no card is found. Dr. Elm erupts into a nervous chuckle._
**Dr. Elm:** …YOU LOST YOUR KEY?! You?
**Dr. Press:** Ivan, is it really you? Shall we lock you up and surveil you for a couple of months to make sure?
**Dr. Elm:** Oh my god Press, have mercy on him.
**Dr. Cattail:** …I’m going outside.
_Cattail straightens his back and prepares to strut away, but is stopped by Press. She grabs him by the shoulders as Dr. Elm watches._
**Dr. Press:** No, Cat, I appreciate the gesture, but K’s not gonna be there.
**Dr. Elm:** You sure Press? What would he need the key for then?
**Dr. Press:** I read his diary, I know what he wants. He’s looking for a small, warm space with dim lights: some stuffy nook, like 8696's nest. Besides, we don’t even know if he has the key.
_Dr. Cattail bites his knuckles, absorbed in thought._
**Dr. Cattail:** …I think he does. You need one to get into the basement.
* * *
_Cattail and Press stand side by side in a barren concrete corridor. The two wait for Elm, who scurries down the stairs behind them._
**Dr. Elm:** By the way, I got one of these. I think you should have it. A sedative with a heightened dose, just for K.
_Doctor Elm takes a small plastic case out of his pocket. It has a capped hypodermic needle inside, which he shows briefly before closing the container again._
**Dr. Press:** Why us?
**Dr. Elm:** Oh I don’t wanna get close to K. He’s no athlete, but a lot stronger than my skinny ass. Even if we don’t count the, what, five extra limbs he’s grown? No chance.
**Dr. Cattail:** I’ll take it, it’s only fair.
**Dr. Press:** Damn right.
_A metallic thud can be heard in a room somewhere further down the hallway. It grabs the attention of everyone present, and they begin carefully approaching its source._
_All three researchers are gathered around the door of the laundry room. Doctor Elm presses his ear to the metal and listens closely. Cattail tries joining him in this effort, but is startled away when Elm begins to gesture excitedly. He points at the door._
**Dr. Elm:** (whisper) It’s him.
_Elm uses his keycard to open the lock and pulls the door open slowly. The dimly lit room is difficult to make out, but it quickly becomes clear where the researchers should look._
_Dr. Käämioja has wrapped himself into a large pile of freshly dried laundry. He lays on the floor with his back stuck to the radiator. Only his mouth and nose are exposed, but they’re quickly lost inside of the mess of linens and clothing as he withdraws deeper into the mass. Dr. Press enters the room first and begins talking in a soft, sweet tone._
**Dr. Press:** Hi K.
**Dr. Käämioja:** Please just close the door! I’m begging please, please close it, the heat is escaping.
_It’s difficult to tell where his body begins and ends, as it twists and turns underneath the fabrics._
**Dr. Press:** It’s fine, we’re here to make you feel better, okay?
**Dr. Elm:** Yeah! We’ll help you get out of here!
**Dr. Käämioja:** I DON’T WANNA GO OUT!!
_Press gives Dr. Elm a sharp glare, after which he promptly shuts his mouth and retreats back into the hallway. Cattail takes his place on the woman's side._
**Dr. Press:** W-we’re not gonna take you out K. Just… help you get warm and-
**Dr. Käämioja:** You lie to me all the time! You say I’m fine and I’ll get through it but I can’t get through!! I don’t wanna! *sob* I don’t wanna go out.
_Käämioja writhes and whimpers. He turns his back to the doorway, disengaging from the conversation. Press and Cattail look at each other, both unsure of what to do._
**Dr. Cattail:** K, you need to calm down and collect yourself. This is going nowhere and we need to get you back in your room!
_The cries intensify. Dr. Käämioja crawls into the furthest corner of the room, attempting to wedge himself between the wall and the washing machine unsuccessfully._
**Dr. Press:** (whisper) What the fuck are you doing? If he could collect himself he would have done so already. Barking orders at him won’t work when he’s barely comprehending them.
**Dr. Cattail:** Well what am I supposed to do?
**Dr. Press:** I don’t know. Your job?
_Cattail shakes his head and stops to think for a moment. He then begins slowly approaching Käämioja, carefully stepping around socks and shirts. He fiddles with the sleeve of his coat. Käämioja notices him and turns to face the man._
**Dr. Käämioja:** Don’t- I’m not coming out!
**Dr. Cattail:** It’s fine K.
**Dr. Käämioja:** I’m not coming.
**Dr. Cattail:** You don’t have to. Just stay still-
**Dr. Käämioja:** ÄLÄ!![2](javascript:;)
_Käämioja lifts his legs up to place an obstacle between him and Cattail. This pulls the fabrics he’s hiding in up, sliding them out from under Cattails feet. He loses his balance, tries to regain his footing and fails._
_Cattail slips on a sweater and falls to his knees, hitting his forehead on the corner of the radiator. He swears and presses his fingers against the injury. His hand turns bright red, as the wound bleeds across his face. It’s a miniscule lesion, but the amount of blood flowing from it is enough to frighten the other researchers, including Käämioja. He freezes for a moment, eyes fixated on Cattail. He then lunges at the man, abandoning his hideout completely._
**Dr. Käämioja:** Are you hurt? Did I hurt you?!
_His words sound clearer than before, if a bit stuffy from the crying. Cattail is startled by the sudden approach. He looks at his hand, then at Käämioja. He smiles._
**Dr. Cattail:** …A little. A hug would help.
_He opens his arms and Dr. Käämioja reciprocates the gesture. He squeezes his body tightly, visibly calming both parties involved. All four of his arms are wrapped around the man, and as Cattail embraces Käämioja, he rests his head on the nape of his neck. He then uncaps the hidden needle inside of his sleeve and administers the sedative. The pain makes Käämioja let out a quiet groan._
**Dr. Cattail:** Shh, it’s okay…it’s not your fault. I'm sorry K, I really am.
_Käämioja does not respond. He seems content in staying still._
**Dr. Elm:** Hell yeah Cat! We got him, now we just need to go and-
**Dr. Cattail:** No, I'm gonna hold him until he's all the way gone.
_Elm and Press observe as Cattail pets and soothes Käämioja in his arms. As the medicine begins taking effect, he becomes progressively more limp, slowly slipping into full unconsciousness. He looks blissfully calm._
**Dr. Cattail:** Shh, It’ll be alright, for real this time…What are you two looking at?? Make yourself useful and find a stretcher!

**Addendum 8696-05:** After 44 days of containment, SCP-8696-A's transformation was brought to an end in an attempt to rescue him from further mental anguish. Future research will instead focus on the study and relocation of SCP-8696 itself.
Surgical removal of SCP-8696-A’s extra limbs was partially successful. Arm Back was severed with relative ease, but both of his new legs left considerable damage in their absence. Removal of the arms on his shoulders was left undone, as they were too well embedded within Dr. Käämioja's natural tissue. Removal would have greatly hindered the range of motion and function in his upper body.
Subject reported having a “clearer mind” immediately after the operation, stating that his compulsions and urges have greatly decreased. Dissection of the severed extremities revealed that they house independent nervous systems, similarly to octopus tentacles.
Experimental follow-up treatment for Dr. Käämioja included psychotherapy and SSRI medication. This has helped to quell the compulsions, which proves that they were at least in large part purely psychological in nature. Dr Käämioja has resumed his positon as a foundation researcher, and aside from mild stomach issues (related to his medication) and limited mobility in his legs, his health matches that prior to the incident with SCP-8696. He has been provided an upright walker and routine medical examinations are to be conducted once every two days.
**Addendum 8696-06:** SCP-8696-A’s follow-up treatment has been highly successful. Despite everything he has gone through, he has retained a positive outlook on life, and has yet to face issues pertaining to urges or new limbs. He reports feeling confident in his body, and enjoying the “new possibilities” his four armed frame provides.
SCP-8696-A is still not allowed to leave the facility, but has been permitted to customize his living space with some limitations. Any and all items will be purchased using his own personal funds, and must be approved by the site director (Request to buy a PlayStation 5 has been granted. Request to buy an indoor Jacuzzi has been denied).

_The feed cuts into a scene of Dr. Käämioja using all four of his arms simultaneously. He's buttering a piece of toast with his natural limbs, while his upper left arm writes notes and the right pours coffee into a cup. Dr. Cattail is observing him, standing on his toes to peek over Dr. Käämioja's shoulder._
**Dr. Cattail:** Impressive, they function rather autonomously. Even though your attention is fully focused on your original arms, they can still perform sophisticated tasks.
**Dr. Käämioja:** Yeah they're smart! The left one even has its own handwriting.
**Dr. Cattail:** …no, I think its just having a hard time gripping the pen. Oh, hello Doctor Press. How's the logbook?
**Dr. Press:** It's fine, I've gone over most of the notes now, but "Rusketusraidat" has me a bit confused. What is it?
**Dr. Käämioja:** Oh it's a song, a great one! I can show it to you… Wait, who translated my logs?
**Dr. Press:** Me.
**Dr. Käämioja:** Press! Puhutsä siis..?[3](javascript:;)
**Dr. Press:** Joo.[4](javascript:;)
**Dr. Käämioja:** Oh my god, I thought I'd be doing it myself!! So you read the- the ones with the-
**Dr. Press:** All of it. It's fine K, Cattail should have given you clearer directions if he didn't want you to write _everything_.
**Dr. Cattail:** Hey, I'm a busy man! I don't have time to hold you people's hands while you do your job.
**Dr. Press:** Hirveä tiukkapipo tuo mies.[5](javascript:;)
**Dr. Käämioja:** Joo, kamala.[6](javascript:;)
**Dr. Cattail:** …I suggest you use our working language.
**Dr. Press:** Et voi pakottaa.[7](javascript:;)
_Dr. Cattail sighs, before being startled by Dr. Elm._
**Dr. Elm:** TEACH ME TOO!! I want in on the conspiracy.
**Dr. Cattail:** Jesus Christ Elm, we should put a bell around your neck. That scared the shit out of me!
**Dr. Käämioja:** Oh my god, Halloween is tomorrow guys! I almost forgot!! Did you get the stuff?
**Dr. Elm:** Oh I've got more than just "the stuff," we've got enough popcorn to make at least three different flavors.
**Dr. Käämioja:** Do you wanna join, Cattail? We'll watch 'The Fly', it's not gonna take all day or anything.
**Dr. Cattail:** Hm…The Fly is certainly a good film.
**Dr. Käämioja:** …so?
**Dr. Cattail:** I'm coming, K! That clear enough for you?! I'm coming.
**Dr. Käämioja:** Yay!
