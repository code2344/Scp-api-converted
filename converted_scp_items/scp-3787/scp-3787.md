### FOUNDATION CONTAINMENT COMMITTEE NOTICE
_Because the anomalies associated with SCP-3787 continue to change over time, its documentation appears here in chronological order. All observed changes to the properties of this anomaly will appear as addenda materials. Only the most recent version of this anomaly's containment procedures is viable._
_The original 30 June 2021 documentation is as follows._
[▷ Access Archived Containment Procedures ◁](javascript:;)
[△ Retract Archived Containment Procedures △](javascript:;)
### SPECIAL CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES [`OUTDATED`]
* * *
Foundation personnel within the [Parazoology Division](/scp-4778) currently operate in various tiers of the U.S. equine industry. This measure exists to ensure:
  1. That horse breeding continues as a controlled element.
  2. That further progression of the anomaly can be mitigated.

Analysts are to track domesticated horse populations for anomalous behaviours such as uncharacteristic or unprovoked aggression, deviance from feeding habits, and deviance from natural breeding cycles. Known feral horse populations are to be monitored for abnormal activity.
To maintain the well-being of baseline horses, personnel are to avoid sterilization efforts within current populations and any restrictive actions taken to manage overpopulation. Instead, personnel are to disperse hormonal agent 762988-16-7 within horse populations. 762988-16-7 targets horse endocrine systems to promote docility and extend breeding cycles.
No known means of containing SCP-3787-ε exist at present. The Site-82 Operations Command Office is, however, accepting containment initiatives.
KETER-Class remains the classification of this anomaly until satisfactory levels of containment are met.
* * *
**Description:** SCP-3787 is a deviance to the natural behaviour of domesticated and free-roaming horse (_Equus ferus caballus_) populations in the Southern and Southwestern United States.
SCP-3787 manifests as a gestation period 8–10 times more rapid than the baseline horse-breeding cycle. Within affected mares, the baseline gestation period of 11–12 months shortens to 30–45 days from conception to birth. As a result, up to 10 times as many foals are born. Growth rates of this size are unsustainable and constitute a significant risk to the equine industry's ability to maintain control.
This breeding cycle does not adversely affect pregnant mares or resultant newborn foals. Newborn foals exhibit physiological properties similar to their non-anomalous counterparts. Foals also develop within pregnant mares despite lacking the necessary sustenance over the accelerated developmental period.
**SCP-3787-1** is an anomalous increase in horse aggression in free-roaming horse populations. Examples of aggression include:
  * Unprovoked hostilities toward horses outside a constituent pack.
  * The active killing of most or all members of a feral horse pack by that pack's dominant stallion.
  * The cannibalization of foals as a show of dominance.

(Hover to enlarge.)
Increase in horse hostility has also extended into normal horse feeding patterns. Feral horse packs affected by this anomaly perform organized attacks on other wildlife, escalating to a point in which affected horses ignore herbivorous feeding habits. These attacks occur even though horse jaw structures and digestive systems are biologically unsuited for meat consumption. This manner of aggression has contributed to the advancement of horses to the top of the food chain in many areas.
SCP-3787-1 began in newborn foals affected by SCP-3787. It has since transferred to an unknown number of horse populations of various ages, according to a geometric infection model. In addition, this anomaly has developed in the same period and area as a memetic form of equinophobia, designated SCP-3787-ε.. **equinophobia:** An irrational fear of horses.
**SCP-3787-ε** is an intense fear of horses in humans without previous basis to do so. Researchers hypothesize SCP-3787-ε manifested because of a marked increase of horse population numbers, which caused an increase of equine concepts in the human consciousness. Persons may be unaware they have been affected by this anomaly until their re-exposure to the concept of horses through forms of media or personal conversations that reference horses.
SCP-3787-ε occurs in suburban areas, urban centres, and within populations far from rural communities. More specifically, SCP-3787-ε occurs within populations with little access to the equine.. Domesticated stud farms are an example of a resource unreachable to populations in these kinds of communities. Populations interested in thoroughbred horseracing remain unaffected
An estimated 750 000 persons within the continental United States have contracted this anomaly.

## ADDENDA MATERIALS
* * *
**I. SCP-3787 Update**
On 30 June 2021, Foundation efforts to reduce the heightened equine birth rate were successful. The median horse gestation period levelled out to ~1.5 times the baseline. In the 2 months since detecting the anomaly, more than 450 000 new horses were born in the United States alone.
On 12 July, Parazoology Division personnel observed what they hypothesized was an anomalous illness spreading throughout domesticated horse populations. Horses affected by this illness experienced a period of acute stress and entered a comatose state. In 18% of instances, affected horses later expired. An estimated 37% of horses in the Southern and Southwestern United States have been afflicted with this illness.
As of 29 August, research efforts into a vaccine have proved ineffective.
* * *
**II. Project: DIRE HORSE**
The accelerated spread of this illness has caused the death of ~1.1 million horses in the United States. In response, [Site-82](/scp-4758) — in conjunction with the Scientific Department — has published two reports on Project: DIRE HORSE to the IntSCPFN network.

### SUMMARY OF PROJECT: DIRE HORSE
* * *
Project: DIRE HORSE outlines the production of a significant horse population and the dissemination of this new population across the United States. This is to be conducted to mitigate the ongoing loss of horse populations and produce a phenotype resistant to the effects of the anomalous illness.
To achieve this goal, DIRE HORSE has employed the use of Ashleigh's Fields: A cattle farm in Newton News, Montana. Ashleigh's Fields has been working under the Foundation front company Stratford Cattle Productions since 2010. Ashleigh's Fields uses an industrial farming facility responsible for the mass production of synthetic livestock in place of modern farming techniques.
![factory-farm.jpg](https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-3787/factory-farm.jpg)

(Hover to enlarge.)
DIRE HORSE will use the Rimmer–Lister Hippological Simulacrum (or RLHS) prototype. The RLHS can produce 500 artificially grown adult horses (or 1 000 foals) per 6-hr period, within 99.91% genetic similarity of their natural counterparts. Horses produced by the RLHS undergo behavioural engineering and memetic hardening to reduce the potential effects of an SCP-3787-1 spread into its population.
In a runaway equine extinction event, the RLHS and its sentinel facility at Ashleigh's Fields can store up to 100 000 stable horses in cryogenic storage for up to a decade.
To reduce general awareness of the full spread of the equine illness, DIRE HORSE is to promptly begin replacing horse populations in 35 U.S. states. Any expired horses affected by SCP-3787 are to be collected and transported to Site-41 Mnestic Production Facility-_Aleph_ for decommissioning.

Site-41, Facility-_Aleph_.  
  
(Hover to enlarge.)
To prevent environmental contamination, expired SCP-3787-affected horses are undergoing decommissioning, detailed as follows.
  1. A network of Foundation web crawlers is to conduct mass media blackouts by purging any verified news reports on SCP-3787.
  2. Foundation personnel planted in the U.S. equine industry are to track all areas affected by mass die-offs. Expired horses identified during this process are to be removed from affected areas on an immediate basis and transported to Site-41, Facility-_Aleph_ , for neutralization.
  3. A randomized pool of 1 500 expired horses is to be stored for future testing.

Neutralization efforts will operate with the end goal of destroying all expired horses affected by SCP-3787. Per Procedure MNEMOSYNE, destroyed subjects are to be broken down into multi-component slurry to begin the transformation into Class-W Mnestics**[A]** material..

### VIDEO LOG

**NOTE:** Because of the high volume of antimemetic anomalies on-site, all cameras at Site-41 are outfitted with a Mariotte-Pashler antimemetic perception filter. For identification purposes, anomalies corresponding with this description are outlined in red.

**[BEGIN LOG | 01:04 AM]**

[_A large wheel-shaped anatomical mass (automatically marked in red) appears near Site-41. The anatomical structure disables a surveillance pylon at 55 km/hr. Security alarms whine and the mass charges toward nearby Facility-_ Aleph _._]
[_Mobile Task Force Chai-10 (“Oxygenated Morons”), a three-member fast-insertion unit operating a light strike vehicle (or LSV) outfitted with an M2 heavy machine gun, approaches the pylon to investigate. The mass notices the task force and mimics[freezing behaviour](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freezing_behavior), whinnying as it shudders._]
**CH-10-Lead GARTER:** Easy there, girl. You're a _stunner_ , aren't you?
**CH-10 CASSIUS:** Who are you talking to?
**CH-10-Lead GARTER:** [_He groans._] Turn on your filter, dumbass. Things are about to get hairy.
**CH-10 CASSIUS:** [_He fumbles with his gear before activating a filter in his helmet._] Holy shit!
**CH-10 AZALEA:** Can our weapons even hit that thing? [_She hesitates._] I mean, it's antimemetic, and the ammo's not spell-coated or anything. What if it passes right through?
[_The mass slowly transforms into a ball and expands._]
**CH-10-Lead GARTER:** Clever hypothesis, AZALEA. [_He chuckles._] Well? Find out for us, will you?
[_AZALEA fires at the mass and punctures its outer layer, which emits loud equine vocalizations. A tan equine entity separates from the larger mass and gallops toward the task force._]
**CH-10 AZALEA:** I'll consider _that_ debunked. [_She repositions the M2 and focuses on the entity._]
[_CASSIUS reverses the vehicle and circles the mass in a broad arc. The entity matches velocities and chases the unit for an extended period, then latches itself onto the back of the LSV. The larger mass remains stationary._]
[_AZALEA expels 150 rounds at the entity. The entity breaks apart into smaller portions that each continue to animate, implanting themselves into various places on the vehicle to squeeze inside._]
[_The LSV ceases operation._]
**CH-10-Lead GARTER:** All right, everybody out. Let's hole ourselves up before that _thing_ decides to attack.
[_MTF-Chai-10 exits the LSV and travels into cover and out of frame. The visible entity squeezes the rest of its body into the vehicle. Equine vocalizations continue._]
[_Soon after, the larger mass reaches a diameter of about 3 m and moves again, this time rolling toward Facility-_ Aleph _at an immense speed. It collides with the facility, causing structural damage and disabling the video feed. Audio surveillance continues._]
[_Site systems log the activation of an automated anti-intrusion and disorientation system, illuminating the area with high-powered 1 000-watt floodlights._]
[_Audio surveillance registers a sharp equine vocalization — loud at first, but eventually receding into silence._]

**CLOSING REMARKS:** The next morning, site security launched an investigation on the premises. Security personnel found the equine entity trapped within the LSV, its form blackened and shrivelled — neutralized by prolonged exposure to intense light.
Foundation cryptozoologists have launched an investigation into these newly discovered equine entities.

**IV. Investigation**
**ARCHIVIST'S NOTE:** This conclusion was derived based on the short time span between the conclusion of Project: DIRE HORSE and 3787-_N_ appearances near common horse populations.
Foundation personnel specializing in antimemetics training have noted the emergence of large numbers of antimemetic equine entities. These entities, designated 3787-_N_ , appear _en masse_ as a direct result of extended Foundation efforts to control U.S. horse population numbers.
A comprehensive description of these entities is as follows.

### 3787-_N_ DESCRIPTION
* * *
**3787-_N_** is a collective of predatory, semi-humanoid equine entities. Each 3787-_N_ instance is composed of malleable cartilage integrated with groupings of musculature typical of horses. One defining feature is its horse-like cranium, which consists of a muzzle capable of equine vocalizations. Naturally occurring braided horsehair is present in the form of a mane and tail. Each strand of hair is autonomous; 3787-_N_ efforts to control hair movement often appear laboured, and seem unsuccessful.
Though 3787-_N_ possesses dull, rounded teeth, it has been observed to engage in carnivorous activities and consume humans — albeit rarely. Instead of feeding for sustenance, instances choose to hunt for recreation.
All 3787-_N_ appendages are capable of contorting, elongating, and wrapping around themselves. In acts of defence, 3787-_N_ will balloon its body outward. Instances will also mount one another, combining in tandem with the formation of wheel-like anatomical structures to use their collective body mass as a moving vehicle. When this occurs, velocities of up to 150 km/hr have been observed.
Sightings of 3787-_N_ occur in nocturnal settings. 3787-_N_ is a pack predator, appearing in groups ranging between five and 50 instances. These groups typically manifest near domestic or thoroughbred horse farms and feral horse packs.
3787-_N_ display a strong revulsion to most forms of visible light and experience physical damage on exposure. The Task Forces Commander at Site-82 advises any personnel in the vicinity of 3787-_N_ instances to carry any form of light-based weaponry available.
No other means of damaging 3787-_N_ have been observed at present.
Containment analysts at Site-82 have come to infer a complex relationship among the appearances of 3787-_N_ and previous equine anomalies. Analysts conclude that the emergence of increased equine aggression and accelerated birth rates was, in part, a widespread anomalous defence mechanism tailored toward the repulsion of 3787-_N_.
Current reports show that this behaviour has almost reversed, in part because of the emergence and influence of 3787-_N_ — which horses now act subservient toward.
Research Director Elliot Alces has approved the reclassification of SCP-3787 to an ARCHON-Class anomaly.. **ARCHON-Class:** Designates anomalies that can be contained but ought not to, because of the damage that would be caused by doing so. The Foundation is presently undergoing wide-scale internal research efforts focused on the anomalous nature of horses as a species.
Since the appearance of 3787-_N_ , horses in the United States have deviated from their typical behaviour.. Horses produced by Project: DIRE HORSE have, however, maintained their designed behaviour. Almost all observed horse populations display SCP-3787-1 and attack humans, causing civilian casualties beyond Foundation control. In areas with a significant volume of horses displaying SCP-3787-1, domesticated and feral horses alike have begun a mass transit to an as-yet unconfirmed area in the American Southwest, led by groups of 3787-_N_.
How the two groups communicate is now under active investigation.
3787-_N_ have directed efforts toward constructing a large equine-centric locale composed of both horses and 3787-_N_ populations. Contact by any non-equine populations has led to confrontational behaviour on the part of 3787-_N_.
Foundation personnel managing the effects of SCP-3787 also face aggression. In some instances, personnel have undergone bodily transfiguration into horses via inexplicable means.

**V. Further Actions Taken**
Mobile Task Force Pi-5 (“Glue Factory”) has formed to repel the attacks of 3787-_N_. Each member of Pi-5 is trained to deal with antimemetic anomalies and is assigned a strict Class-W Mnestic prescription.
A summary of Pi-5, Alpha Platoon, is as follows.
  * Forty combat operatives with light-based weaponry such as the 1 000-watt N-62A Laser Optics Pistol, the 2 000-watt G1A Tactical Solid-state Laser Rifle, and the prototype 30 000-watt Basov-Prokhorov RX-7Z Hard-Light Heavy Rifle (“Nulltaker”).
  * 4 000-lumen flashlights and interfaces with night vision and blue-light eye protection lenses.
  * Fifteen Polaris MV800 All-Terrain Vehicles outfitted with Light Reconnaissance Laser Optic gun platforms.
  * Ten Chenowth Utility Terrain Vehicles.
  * Four SL/SX Support Drones fitted with Mariotte-Pashler antimemetic perception filters.

Despite the formation of Pi-5, the full containment of 3787-_N_ and any related anomalies is not yet possible because of their widespread nature.
The Foundation is now directing efforts toward reducing [the fear of horses.](/scp-4466)
