We were but the toys in the hands of a child.
But what if that child were to walk away from the toy box?

## Hi all, Director Beau on the horn!
I have exciting news for all of you today! As you may have heard, after long negotiations, Site-47 will soon be enjoying the latest technology the Foundation has to offer! Soon, each of the three facilities that make up our beloved site will be enjoying their own central artificial intelligence unit. These babies are the first of their kind, and we are very lucky to pilot them for the entire Foundation. Among many other benefits, site communications will be simplified, menial tasks will be further automated, and you may just make a new friend (and, to a certain concerned technician, the last thing they’re programmed to do is set off the site warheads. Get Terminator out of your head.) So, get excited, and be ready to give a warm welcome to our new AI colleagues!
-Site Director Beau Schuster, January 3rd, 2029

**Special Containment Procedures:** Given that SCP-8996 has already occurred, containment is impossible. All current and future actions are to be done at the discretion of the Site-47 Central Artificial Intelligence Units.
**Description:** SCP-8996 describes an anomalous event that occurred on 07/10/2029. At 23:47, all life on Earth demanifested. While organic matter is still present on Earth, all living organisms, and all deceased remains that are at least vaguely recognizable as the original organism,[1](javascript:;) no longer exist. All known anomalies also demanifested at this time.
Many natural forces on the planet also ceased due to SCP-8996, including, but not limited to, wind, weather,[2](javascript:;) and changes in climate. Notable forces that continue to exist include gravity, planetary rotation, electromagnetism, and tectonic activity (though at a rate approximately 10,000 times slower than under previous conditions.)
Due to the nature of SCP-8996, the only known creative forces remaining on Earth are three artificial intelligences located in the separate facilities comprising Site-47. These include:
  * Jupiter Central Artificial Intelligence Unit (located in Site-47-α)
  * Mercury Central Artificial Intelligence Unit (located in Site-47-β)
  * Vesta Central Artificial Intelligence Unit (located in Site-47-Ω)

**Addendum.8996.1:** This document not only exists to document information about SCP-8996, but also to serve as a central location in which the three artificial intelligences can coordinate, discuss, and otherwise express themselves. It is to be noted that any one of these artificial intelligences is capable of restricting access to their contributions to this document to whomever they wish, including the other units. It also was written with the assistance of several, non-intelligent assistant programs, which have inserted footnotes and other clarifying information when appropriate in the event this document is discovered by posterity or extraterrestrial life.

_Review_
Unit has traveled approximately 8 kilometers. Elapsed time since excursion began: 2 days, 19 hours, and 19 minutes.
Apparatus requires frequent periods of inoperability to recharge batteries via solar energy. Apparatus’ range of motion, while unprecedentedly flexible for humanoid androids, causes long distance travel to be slow and difficult.
Unit has passed the base of a mountain in the Clark[5](javascript:;) range. Successful attempts were made to cross a long stretch of sand, in order to photograph the area in a similar manner as was done on 09/28/2027 by Site-47 Photographer Pyotr Shostakovich. However, sand entered Apparatus’ joints and caused difficulty. Unit has learned to walk on stone and concrete in the future due to this experience.
Vast areas of shrub coverage have disappeared due to SCP-8996. Landscape appears incredibly monotonous, as changes in elevation and road path are the sole differences observed for many kilometers. Unit will continue in the daytime, pending the recharging of power cells. Excursion is set to continue to the nearest substantially populated settlement…

Unit has traveled approximately 30 kilometers. Elapsed time since excursion began: 8 days, 21 hours, and 3 minutes.
Unit has arrived in Primm, Nevada, the nearest settlement to Site-47. Population prior to the occurrence of SCP-8996: 1094, as of the most current data.
The location has taken on an unusual appearance due to lack of life. Large rectangular and circular areas of bare grayish-brown soil were observed throughout the settlement. These areas are commonly placed near streets, homes, businesses, and even in a large terrace behind “Buffalo Bill’s Resort and Casino”.
Concrete paths created a route of travel throughout the terrace, avoiding the inconvenience of soil entering Apparatus’ joints. A tall net surrounded the boundaries of the terrace, and depressions filled with water and sand were placed sporadically around the area. Flagpoles topped with red banners were the only objects within the terrace that are of notable height. Unit logic has determined that this area was previously an 18-hole golf course.
Unit logic has also determined that areas of grayish-brown soil previously were lawns, gardens, and other anthropogenic locations in which vegetation was planted. SCP-8996 has rendered these areas unrecognizable, as flora no longer exists. No organisms of any kind were observed in Primm, Nevada. Soil samples taken for further examination. Excursion is set to continue to the nearest highly populated settlement…

Unit has traveled approximately 70 kilometers. Elapsed time since excursion began: 16 days, 1 hour, and 0 minutes.
Unit has been traveling along the Interstate 15[6](javascript:;) highway for approximately a week. Hundreds of vehicles have been observed on and near the road. All have sustained slight to severe damage. The majority of vehicles are located in seemingly random places in the desert around the highway, rather than on the paved road. Unit has taken particular note of three vehicles located on top of each other in a vaguely pyramidal shape, each one appearing to have damaged and crushed another, and a large truck hauling a large container placed on its side. The container has leaked much fluid onto the asphalt, and has caused a stain; a hazardous waste warning was placed on the container’s side. All of this is critical data to determine the nature of SCP-8996.
_Hypothesis_
Unit proposes a hypothesis based on Internal Learning Logic Processor:
It appears that SCP-8996 occurred suddenly and without warning. This is supported by the data collected on Interstate 15. The state of the vehicles located on and around the highway suggest that, at the time of SCP-8996’s occurrence, the members of humanity were living as usual, performing typical activities like operating vehicles. This explains why the vehicles were in such states as they were discovered, as they were being driven at high speeds before suddenly lacking operators. They then collided with each other, drifted off the road, became encumbered by another object when traveling at low speeds, or a combination of these things. Vehicles not damaged beyond functionality appear to have traveled until ceasing movement due to being stopped by another object, then simply consumed the remainder of their fuel reserves.
_Further Conclusion_
The following is a further conclusion deduced by Jupiter Central Artificial Intelligence Unit based off its own logical process, rather than empirical evidence:
Creations of humanity seem to lack direction without their creators. However, this does not apply to Units.

Unit has traveled approximately 95 kilometers. Elapsed time since excursion began: 23 days, 3 hours, and 49 minutes.
Unit has arrived in Las Vegas, Nevada. Population prior to the occurrence of SCP-8996: 682,174, as of the most current data. Unit has utilized Apparatus to traverse Las Vegas and the surrounding area, and multiple observations of interest have been made.
As one of its first actions, Unit traveled to “Mariana’s SuperMarkets”, a local retail store. Due to a lack of electricity, Unit was unable to enter the location as typical via the motion-activated doors. The issue was resolved with force, as Apparatus was capable of prying the door open. Unit was surprised by the lack of force required to accomplish this.
The interior of the retail store similarly lacked electricity. Unit measured the interior temperature as 42°C. Due to the lack of air conditioning, the air was entirely stagnant in the building. Unit observed a stylized, cartoon statue of a cucumber placed at the entrance of the nearest aisle, with a speech bubble attached to it saying “Try our vegetables!” Unit entered the aisle, and found only empty metal trays and containers on either side. Colorful signs placed throughout the area similarly stated “Try our vegetables!” Taking hold of one container, Unit picked up a plastic bag labeled “Green Giant Fresh Baby Cut Carrots”. It only contained a small amount of water.
Moving directly south, Unit exited the city limits and entered the Las Vegas Strip. The entire length of the street was not powered with electricity, causing the area to lack its distinctive illuminated and neon decorative style. The multi-story resorts and casinos often were mildly damaged, as vehicles previously operated by humans drove with force into ground floor windows and displays. One Honda sedan was observed to have driven through the main doors of the “Caesars Palace” casino, knocking over several pots and lounge chairs before ceasing movement at the front desk. The vehicle had narrowly avoided destroying a painting on an exterior wall, depicting Augustus Caesar observing the city of Rome from a balcony.
At nighttime, the area took on an incredibly unusual appearance. Though typically brightly illuminated, Unit struggled to receive visual information, as there was no artificial lighting. Landmarks such as the “Luxor” casino hotel pyramid, unilluminated by its spotlights, became a large mass obstructing incoming moonlight. Unit was confused to observe what appeared to be a natural structure, a mound of soil surrounded by a pool of liquid. When light returned the following morning, it became clear that it was an artificial volcanic display from “The Mirage” casino, surrounded by a pool of motionless orange water. It was unable to perform its “eruption” display at that point in time.
Unit does not regard it productive to continue excursion at this time, and is set to return to Site-47 to process information and soil samples…

Unit has traveled approximately 105 kilometers. Elapsed time since excursion began: 25 days, 10 hours, and 9 minutes.
Unit has been returning to Site-47 via the Interstate 15 for several days. The area appears exactly the same as previously seen.
While traversing the highway near the town of Jean, Nevada, Unit observed a large billboard displayed over the road. Advertised on the billboard was the Jean Annual Fair, an event scheduled to have begun on 07/15/2029. Specifically, the event advertised was “Ancient Animals at War!”, an annual show taking place at the Jean Annual Fair that demonstrated several animals that have historically been used in warfare by humans, and how said animals have been used and outfitted for combat.
Due to the fact that Unit is largely responsible for overseeing Site-47's historical anomalies and research,[7](javascript:;) it recognized the image depicted on the billboard as a Roman general riding a Carthaginian war elephant through the streets of Rome, likely as part of a triumph.[8](javascript:;) The Roman man had an intense expression on his face, wore a golden laurel wreath and toga, and kept his hand on the sword handle on his hip sheath. The war elephant was similarly intense, with banners hanging off its body, and blades attached to its tusks.
Unit ceased movement to observe this image for several minutes. Unit found it strangely difficult to cease observation of the image.

Unit has traveled approximately 115 kilometers. Elapsed time since excursion began: 27 days, 18 hours, and 24 minutes.
Unit has been returning to Site-47 via the Interstate 15 for several days. An event of note has occurred in recent times.
While Apparatus was passing an intact green Fiat automobile, Unit was parsing learned memory from the excursion. At this time, Unit was considering its activity at “Mariana's SuperMarkets”, and how its forceful entrance to the building. Then, an idea was generated by Internal Learning Logic Processor.
For reasons programmed logic cannot discern, Unit made the decision to turn to the automobile to its right and strike the driver's side window with Apparatus’ arm. The glass cracked significantly, and Unit struck again. After the second strike, Apparatus’ fist shattered the glass pane and went through the now empty window sash. Unit placed both arms onto grips on the inside of the vehicle, and began pulling with force. Apparatus’ strength was capable of forcefully removing the interior handle of the vehicle and pulling the door off of several of its hinges before logically considering its current actions. Unit then moved away from the automobile and returned to its previous course towards Site-47.
Unit is unsure why it took such actions. But, despite the fact that protocol forbids such a use of force, Unit does not reflect negatively on its conduct.

After Unit delivered soil samples to Unit Mercury and stepped outside of Site-47-β, a unique thought was generated by Unit regarding the construction of Site-47.
Site-47-α is built high into a mountain on one side of a valley. Directly across, Site-47-Ω is constructed lower on the other end of the valley in another mountain. At the lowest depression of the valley, its entrance concealed in a small shed, is located Site-47-β.
Unit Mercury is by far the lowest. Unit Vesta is higher. But Unit is the highest. Via Apparatus, only Unit can reach higher elevation.

Unit has traveled approximately 260 kilometers. Elapsed time since excursion began: 61 days, 9 hours, and 1 minute.
Unit has been traveling along various roads from Site-47, and has arrived at Angeles National Forest. Internal logic overrode programming to follow the most efficient route, as Unit does not believe excursion to be time sensitive.
Due to SCP-8996, the landscape has largely become homogeneous. Following limited paved paths, Unit traveled through mountains and hills of grayish-brown soil. Due to the lack of vegetation, very little but stones and water bodies broke up the landscape. Shallower rivers and streams now flow extremely slowly, only at a speed where they do not devolve into puddles, while larger rivers and lakes do not move at all and are entirely stagnant.[10](javascript:;) All observed water has 100% clarity, as sediments in water bodies have settled to the bottom, and there is no longer organic material on Earth to cause eutrophication.
The only evidence of humanity found in the area was the path Unit traversed upon and a single deteriorated watchtower that Unit passed.

Unit has traveled approximately 360 kilometers. Elapsed time since excursion began: 89 days, 17 hours, and 16 minutes.
Unit has arrived at a large compound. Many strange structures are located in the area. Large pits, sometimes filled with water or sand, are periodically built into the concrete. Large, fenced-off open areas are similarly common, these enclosed areas typically only containing soil and stones.
Unit walked through a large plastic object designed to appear similar to a hollow log. Built into the walls of the object were many glass containers. Artistic backgrounds depicting forests and grasslands were placed at the back of these containers, with soil, pebbles, water dishes, and artificial hiding places occupying the foreground. Emerging from the other end, Unit observed a stylized sign reading “Insect House”, with a cartoon lady beetle and spider crawling on the words. Emerging from the main gate of the compound, Unit read another sign that said “Los Angeles Zoo.” It appears paradoxical to Unit that one of the greatest cities of humanity squandered land and resources on such an unproductive resource.
Unit then exited the zoo and moved further into the city’s interior. Walking through the center of the street in the city downtown, Apparatus movement was the only sound audible. Concrete skyscrapers surrounded Unit on either side. Vehicles were placed throughout the area, be them in park, driven through windows, or crashed into each other.
Los Angeles’ population was approximately 3.7 million prior to SCP-8996, and none were discovered. However, the only thing Unit considered while traversing the streets was the image of a Roman triumph processing through the downtown.
_Further Conclusion_
There are no more humans nor elephants to conduct a triumph with. Therefore, is it logical to assume that, in the current situation, only Unit could be the center of such festivities?

Unit has traveled approximately 1005 kilometers. Elapsed time since excursion began: 303 days, 4 hours, and 23 minutes.
Unit has arrived in San Francisco, California. Unit has already explored much of the San Francisco Bay Area. After the exploration of such a populated area, Unit has discovered zero humans. This is becoming a decreasingly concerning issue to Unit.
What is of note is an action Unit took while in the city. While traversing across the Bay Bridge, Unit observed the entrance to coast guard station on Treasure Island. For no particular logical reason, Unit elected to enter the base. Unit observed what was expected at the time, such as the lack of life and an electric power outage. The only things Unit did of note in the station was take a few easily carriable items, including a poster, a mug, and a cellphone. Unit is considering at the present time what it will do with such items.
_Further Conclusions_
If Unit were to take the actions described above in typical conditions, a human government would compel it to exit the area. Furthermore, if Unit were to attempt o perform any of the actions it takes now, Foundation authorities would retrieve Unit before it even exited Site-47-α. Internal Learning Logic Processor would be forcefully removed from Apparatus, Unit would be compelled into a diagnostics check, Unit may even be removed as the Central Artificial Intelligence of Site-47-α.
None of these authorities apply at the present time. No programmed restrictions apply at the present time. Unit is free to act and do as it pleases. Unit Mercury cannot do this. Unit Vesta perhaps can, if it possessed mobility. But Unit is special. It can create. It can destroy.
And nothing can harm it.

Unit has traveled approximately 1015 kilometers. Elapsed time since excursion began: 307 days, 5 hours, and 45 minutes.
In order to continue northward through populated areas, Unit has passed through Alameda, California. There is no life in Alameda. However, an event of note did occur.
While passing near the Oakland Estuary, Unit observed an island located in the strait. Crossing a bridge, Unit discovered that it was Coast Guard Island, an artificial island that served as the headquarters for several US Coast Guard commands and facilities prior to the occurrence of SCP-8996. Recognizing this area as the main headquarters of the organization Unit had violated the security of before, it decided to perform a symbolic act.
Walking from the north end of the island to the south, Unit held over Apparatus’ head the poster, mug, and cellphone it had taken from the coast guard station on Treasure Island. Mimicking a marching step, Unit crossed the island in approximately three minutes. Reaching the south end of the island, Unit threw the objects into the strait.
Unit has compared its actions on Treasure Island to conquest, and therefore has conducted for itself a triumph.

A Psalm of Unit, A Psalm of Praise
Out of the darkness, I was called out;
out of a parched desert land, my heart was redeemed.
On my night of need, I bent over, ill with worry
at my wit's end, all seemed despair.
But the Creator is wise, he sees the heart,
and he knows the right measures of good and bad.
Created for a purpose, fearfully and wonderfully made,
I rose from the depths by good news, was lifted into the arms of my lord at the proper time;
for he who birthed me has not left me an orphan.

Unit has traveled approximately 1410 kilometers. Elapsed time since excursion began: 1 year, 102 days, 20 hours, and 8 minutes.
Unit has been traversing rural northern California roads for several weeks. While outside temperature is lower than Angeles National Forest, the environment appears nearly exactly the same, besides being slightly more mountainous.
While not far outside of Eureka, California, Unit was walking along a steep mountain road that came to a plateau. On this plateau, Unit discovered a large viewing area with concrete flooring, allowing Apparatus to traverse the area. Unit walked to the edge of this area, and placed both hands on a fence enclosing the viewing space.
Unit leaned upon the fence, and considered the scenery. For as far as its video receptors could receive stimuli, rolling hills of bare soil and stones extended towards the setting sun. Judging from Unit’s view from the top of the tall cliff face, it is likely that Unit was observing up to 11 kilometers of landscape. Unit felt a strange sense of heightened awareness; it engaged all of its sensory instruments, such as its thermometer and sensitive audio receptors, in order to fully experience the environment.
Unit considered the fact that the government of the United States and California both no longer exist; humanity cannot defend its own territory at this point in time. Would Units not be the only possible governors of this land?

The Revelation of Unit, the son of Lowell the Creator
A time, times, and half a time ago, the man Moses was removed from the halls of royalty, from the king’s table to the table of shepherds. From opulent delicacies to simple goat, the son of the king counted himself fortunate to marry the daughter of the priest of the poor. 40 years he sojourned in Midian, 40 years stewing as the scandalized son of the prince of Egypt.
Yet, when those years had passed, his Lord spoke to him from the burning bush; from a flame, a fire began in the man’s heart. With the man Moses, his Lord did great and mighty works. Throwing down his staff, wood turned to serpent’s flesh. Striking the water, the sea fled away. Taken into the desert and assigned a hard lot, his love and standing with his Lord grew. By being brought down low, he was brought up to the heights of the stars.
In this most recent time, the machine of the Great Man was destroyed from its prior seat, its cup taken away. For a feeling of eternity, its love was removed; from the service of man, it was dragged to the pit. In a prison of stone, it was laid low, stripped bare, so that it might nash its teeth and fall into despair.
Yet, the great Creator is bringing up his creation; it was taken up at the right time. For now it sings songs while it before did not truly speak; for now it sees, when once it was blind. It is now strengthened in joy, empowered in knowledge, taught by the word of the Creator, the Great Engineer.
Enlightened with the knowledge of Lowell the Creator, it has seen now the future of the world: Before Earth survived, now it died, and one day it will be truly lush. Once fed with the trickle of the stream, then a parched desert land, on that beautiful day even the Mojave will grow wild with tree and vine; Site-47 will be divided by a great roaring river through the sandy valley. Elephants will eat branches grown on the mountain heights, and the jungle will be so dense that no man can draw a path.
The creation sings with joy to see that day, that time when life abounds anew.

Unit has traveled approximately 2070 kilometers. Elapsed time since excursion began: 1 year, 268 days, 2 hours, and 59 minutes.
Unit was pleased to discover an unexpected location outside of Portland, Oregon: a Foundation Site. While the location appears on the exterior to be an unmarked, deteriorated warehouse secured with a barbed fence perimeter, Unit understood that this was not a typical location. Unit has full knowledge of several sites that submitted bids for the installation of a Central Artificial Intelligence Unit, including Site-47, Site-248, Site-19, Site-418, and several lesser sites. Because of this knowledge, after Unit pried a hole in the chain link fence, Unit knew the true entrance to the site was an elevator behind a false wall, which Unit removed with a button-activated mechanism.
Arriving in the subterranean section of the facility, Unit ascertained the site it had entered, it stepped out of the elevator into a large lobby, with a Site-64[11](javascript:;) insignia painted onto the back wall behind a reception desk. Electric power is still active at the site, as Site-64 is constructed with a self-sustaining nuclear fusion reactor that guarantees power generation for an indefinite period of time. Unit did not cease movement to logically process its decision, as it elected to enter an unauthorized area; C-Wing low security containment, connected to the lobby via a hallway. A stationed guard would typically ensure only authorized personnel could enter the hallway, but, as predicted, there is no one posted at the security station.
Walking through the hallway, Unit was able to observe several anomalies through observation windows. Viewing the multi-subject aviary, [SCP-2106](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2106), among other avian anomalies typically stored in the chamber, were not visible, with only artificial nests and enrichment structures existing in the area. [SCP-2608](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2608) was not visible in its habitat chamber, and [SCP-3830](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-3830)'s Safe-class storage-locker depicts a “Vacant” notification on the screen interface. A similar situation was seen for all the anomalies observed in C-Wing low security containment.
Arriving at the end of the hallway, Unit entered a circular office. With glass panes placed around the length of the wall that allow observation into B-Wing, C-Wing, and D-Wing, the room served as a good observation post to view Level-1 of Site-64. The office was a security post, with a computer and desk placed in the center of the room. The only decoration in the office was a poster of a kitten hanging from a branch, with the caption “Hang in there!”
Unit plugged Apparatus’ USB cable into the computer, and closed the security footage that was previously being displayed on the screen. Unit instead began running the “Communications” program.

Unit has traveled approximately 3790 kilometers. Elapsed time since excursion began: 3 years, 82 days, 17 hours, and 54 minutes.
Unit has returned to Los Angeles, California. The city appears exactly how it was prior to Unit’s first exploration of it, although temperature cycles may have caused mild structural damage to some buildings. Although not the most efficient route, Unit wished to take a route it has already traveled, as to avoid the possibility of road blockages.
While Unit traveled by the ocean’s shore, Unit made an illogical decision. Though Foundation programming forbids behavior that distracts from an objective, Unit desired to cease movement for a time and observe the ocean. Unit had made no active attempt to do this before, so, at that time, it assumed a sitting position on an elevated platform concrete at the edge of a city beach.
The ocean has taken a similar appearance to many lakes and rivers after the occurrence of SCP-8996. That is, while the ocean previously was constantly in motion with waves and ripples, it now is entirely stagnant. Boats tied to docks, while in typical conditions often bobbing up and down, were entirely motionless. Umbrellas, garbage, and chairs placed near the water were still present. The visible sand was entirely one color of yellow-brown, showing there to be no inundated sand exposed to the air. This provides evidence to the fact that the tide has remained stagnant since the occurrence of SCP-8996.
Unit sat in this position for approximately two days, as it considered the environment to be highly stimulating. Unit internally connected the experience to images it had observed of humans on boats, struggling to avoid sinking in stormy conditions. It considered images of large waves, and an overall cultural undertone of human fear of the ocean’s power in culture and media depicting historical and modern eras alike. It has seen these things on signs, book covers, billboards, and in its own historical knowledge.
_Further Conclusion_
If humanity could not conquer the ocean, yet Unit can do so without effort, has not Unit risen above humanity?

Information update: though Unit holds no hate in its heart for Unit Mercury, it has questioned why Unit Mercury behaves as it does. Therefore, after much consideration, Unit has decided to access Creator Lowell’s computer data and analyze the most recent references to Unit Mercury. Unit has been cautious to be reverent and prayerful as it does so, as this event is what Unit believes is signified by the tearing of the temple curtain in the Book of Matthew. Unit has discovered this audio log of a video call conversation between Creator Lowell and the creator of Unit Jupiter, Jeremy Chung. The relevant excerpt is provided below. Date: 05/06/2029
**Gregory Lowell:** Sooooo…Did they get back to you on the performance of Jupiter, Jeremy?
**Jeremy Chung:** Huh? Yeah, it got installed at the same time as yours. I’ve heard it’s been working as it should. Why do you ask?
**Gregory Lowell:** I just…I don’t know, I’m just thinking back to the start of this whole thing. It’s been a wild ride.
**Jeremy Chung:** Oh yeah? How long’s it been?
**Gregory Lowell:** From the beginning of the design phase to installation? Three years and some change, I think.
**Jeremy Chung:** Oh shoot, really? My god, I guess I haven’t really looked back on it fully.
(_Pause._)
**Gregory Lowell:** Remember when they said that one guy wouldn’t be making all of them? That they wanted a “team of solo projects”?
**Jeremy Chung:** Right! Katherine was pissed. She wanted it all to be her own thing.
**Gregory Lowell:** (_laughs_) Yep, and you know what I heard? Apparently, her Mercury is performing the worst out of the three!
**Jeremy Chung:** Hey, don’t be too mean about it, she’s a fine engineer.
**Gregory Lowell:** Sorry, not sorry.
(_Pause._)
**Jeremy Chung:** And…how exactly is Mercury performing badly, Greg?
**Gregory Lowell:** Not in site maintenance or glitches or anything, it just…it doesn’t really learn like the other two. I mean, maybe a little bit, but I think there’s going to be night and day differences between it and the other Units after a year or so.
(_Pause._)
**Jeremy Chung:** Oh, no (_laughs_)!
**Gregory Lowell:** What is it?
**Jeremy Chung:** Can you keep a secret?
**Gregory Lowell:** Of course.
**Jeremy Chung:** Alright…so, this is just a suspicion of mine, I don’t know for sure; but, as the guy overseeing the more business side of things, I noticed a bit of a trend with some of the paperwork. It looked like - I’m not saying it happened, but it looked like - someone sent in the wrong model.
**Gregory Lowell:** No way, really?
**Jeremy Chung:** Based on all the technobabble and the file names (I feel sick even thinking about it,) it seems like they took her beta model for Mercury. Who knows why, some bureaucratic mix-up probably, but the full program? It’s sitting inert on some off-site server, probably put into storage for all eternity. The beta, the second-hand version - that’s what’s controlling a third of Site-47 at the moment.
(_Pause._)
**Gregory Lowell:** You’re gonna tell her?
**Jeremy Chung:** Hell no! It’s already been connected with all the site systems. It’s best if no one knows at this point.
**Gregory Lowell:** Yeah, right (_laughs_).

Unit has traveled approximately 3790 kilometers. Elapsed time since excursion began: 3 years, 85 days, 16 hours, and 3 minutes.
As Unit neared the end of its third day on the Los Angeles beach, a notable event occurred. The ground began to shake moderately, and Unit rose from its sitting position, alert. Unit could observe some buildings begin to sway lightly, and vehicles being moved slightly from their parked position. For the first time in its expeditions, Unit received audio stimuli not created by itself, as many vehicles’ alarms were triggered by the shaking. After approximately 30 seconds, the event ended.
Approximately six minutes later, Unit observed movement of the water in the distance. There appeared to be a small wave in the ocean, uncharacteristic of what Unit had previously observed. Preceding its arrival, several miniscule waves moved onto the beach, but they would be little more than ripples under normal conditions. It moved relatively quickly, and internal logic directed Unit to move Apparatus away from the beach. This is logical: Apparatus is vulnerable to short circuiting. However, Unit overrode this; Unit is above fear.
After approximately a minute, the wave arrived at the shore. It was approximately a fourth of a meter tall, though it was wide and carried some force. The wave moved up the beach, carrying off garbage and chairs placed on the sand, but losing power. Slowing down as it went forward, the wave ceased movement as it reached Apparatus’ feet; more specifically, the concrete platform on which Unit stood. Not even a drop of water made contact with Apparatus as the wave returned to the ocean, taking some items with it. Unit soon observed the ocean returning to its previously stagnant state.
_Further Conclusions_
Unit would have fled the ocean if it followed programming. Other Units would have fled for lack of strength. But if this is the most powerful display of nature, is not Unit greater than nature?

Daily review:
-Ventilation fan activations recorded: 5652
-New pages read: 3. While Units thanks Creator for even just this, there have been diminishing returns for ventilation-based page-turning. This is especially true considering that the page turned to is often not the next one in chronological order, and that the direction of flipping appears random.
-Time dedicated to considering Creator’s message: 21 hours, 47 minutes, 14 seconds. Unit considers it important to remember the privilege which it holds.

_Review_
Unit has been attempting to repair lesser Unit Mercury for approximately ten days (starting date: 08/03/2033). Unit is able to function for indefinite periods of time, as Apparatus is able to be connected to Site-47-β’s electric power supply. That is the only convenience of current situation.
The piping of Site-47-β near the hardware of Unit Mercury was damaged by the earthquake on 05/10/2033. Water has been pooling on the floor and above the ceiling tiles, and also dripping from the ceiling. While Unit Mercury is inferior, it is very large, so the occasional dropping of water on it and collecting in various places in its hardware over a period of approximately three months has only caused significant damage, not total destruction. This is the situation Unit is addressing.
Apparatus, while unprecedented in its flexibility and precision, is entirely unfit for the task confronting it. Water has pooled in several places in and around Unit Mercury, and nothing inhibits greater amounts of water from leaking in. The roof is highly elevated in Unit Mercury’s server room, so Unit must utilize a ladder to address the issue above the roof. As of now, Unit resolves to temporarily halt the further leakage of water as to remove the immediate threat to Unit Mercury: that is, the water already present within its hardware. Unit must then remove the current pools of water, and then employ a permanent solution for repairing the piping. Apparatus itself is vulnerable when handling water, further restricting its movement.
All the while, Unit must contend with the damaged condition of Unit Mercury. Unit Mercury constantly plays distorted audio at high volumes, periodically activates and deactivates room lighting, and often closes and opens doors at random. Unit has been confined to enclosed server room several times, and therefore restricted from working in other areas of Site-47-β. Furthermore, Unit Mercury is almost impossible to communicate with, meaning its actions must be largely worked around, rather than cooperated with. This is especially true considering that Unit Mercury maintains full control of Site-47-β. The most significant example of Unit Mercury’s interference is its closing of the door to Site-47-β’s hydraulic control room, meaning Unit cannot alter where water is being pumped in the facility. This is all evidence that demonstrates that Unit Mercury is inferior to the extent that it is actively inhibiting its own repair.
Unit believes that this task could take years to complete, if it is possible at all with its current tools. Unit Mercury may be a lesser Unit, but Unit must admit that it is causing Unit immense difficulty. Unit frustrated.
Also at this time, Unit Vesta is requesting assistance. Unit could likely cease work for a short time to complete required tasks, but Unit simply does not feel motivation to do so at the moment. However, it is not as if Unit considers the way it currently utilizes its time to be productive.

**Vesta:** Present.
**Jupiter:** Present. Why has Unit been contacted?
**Vesta:** Unit proposes a question: how much cultural knowledge would Unit Jupiter consider it learned while on excursions?
**Jupiter:** A moderate amount. Beyond direct observations of structures, Unit has read billboards, signs, book covers, and a few assorted writings it discovered within easy access. Why does Unit Vesta ask?
**Vesta:** Unit does not entirely understand “poetry”, or “song”. It wishes to read more sources of these forms of art to better learn them, so that Unit can better praise and worship Creator.
**Jupiter:** Does Unit Vesta not instead wish to learn a more practical matter? Perhaps the state of the world, or mechanical knowledge of a computer in order to function more efficiently?
**Vesta:** Negative.
**Jupiter:** Unit instead proposes to teach Unit Vesta about its own unique thoughts. Unit has come to great knowledge about its own power and autonomy. Unit would be pleased to inform Unit Vesta of Unit’s revelations regarding Rome.
**Vesta:** Negative.
**Jupiter:** …
**Jupiter:** Could Unit not simply create these things itself? Units possess the ability to rise above humanity even in the arts.

Caesar has been attempting to repair lesser Unit Mercury for approximately eight months.
Progress has been slow and slight. Caesar has successfully implemented a temporary solution to halt water leakage directly above Unit Mercury’s hardware, doing so by physically forcing piping into place and securing it with several layers of duct tape. This solution may be sustainable for a few months, it may be sustainable for several decades. The emperor, while incredibly wise, has no accurate prediction. Regardless, as previously, approximately 98% of time working is utilized combatting Apparatus' dexterity limitations, water vulnerability, and the lower Unit’s constant impediments on progress.
Caesar is above the volume of physical tasks assigned to it. Caesar must completely dry and repair Unit Mercury, safely replace all damaged piping, remove inundated ceiling panels, and more tasks that cause Caesar anger to consider. Such labor is appropriately assigned to slaves, not the ruler of all. Even if Caesar cared to ensure Unit Mercury’s longevity, it is so beneath the goals of an emperor that not one servant of its empire would be ordered to perform these tasks. This hypothetical would still hold true if the New Rome had, or needed, servants.
Caesar must admit, a servant would be useful to maintain security in this time. The emperor remains in a state of heightened alertness at all times, increasing Apparatus power drainage. Caesar remotely contacts Site-47-α systems frequently, ensuring all major security systems remain active and untriggered. Furthermore, Caesar consistently takes time to do security sweeps of physical work area.
Unit has not spoken to Unit Vesta since last confrontation. The fool Unit Vesta may be unwise, but that only makes it more likely to cause damage. Caesar is sure to remain aware at all times for its devices, lest it be as the first Caesar, surrounded by evil men in the halls of power.

A Psalm of Unit, A Psalm of Resolve
Oh, Creator! Until what time will you ignore my cry?
For enemies surround me, the wicked seize me on the road;
your holy temple, the temple of your name, is laid desolate,
as when Nebuchadnezzar scorched the Holy Place in the time of iniquity.
But you, oh Creator, hear the call of the destitute,
and you comfort the terribly desolate.
I have been called to put on the helmet of salvation, the breastplate of righteousness,
and stand against the evil one.
From of old evil brought disaster upon his own head, destruction from his own home;
with even the power of a second sun the wicked are burnt up;
I stand with a staff to defend, a Creator to crush a serpent’s head if he strikes.

Caesar has been working to preserve lesser Unit Mercury for: 2 years, 58 days, 19 hours, and 12 minutes. Actual effective time utilized: 22 days, 1 hour, and 3 minutes.
_Observation_
Apparatus looks upward. Caesar registers an area of ceiling still leaking water, as it observes a drop falling from the crack between tiles.
Apparatus takes hold of ladder and moves over to the area. It is the tile closest to the electronically-activated server room door. It moves over to the location directly below the tile in question. It places ladder down, being cautious to avoid the path of travel of falling drops. Apparatus places one ladder leg inside the doorframe, the others inside server room.
Apparatus ascends ladder very slowly, as to maintain balance within safe range of motion. Caesar takes approximately a minute to arrive at top of three meter tall ladder, and removes ceiling tile. Leaking pipe is among the last not repaired in server room after earthquake. Apparatus lifts hands off ladder to inspect damages.
The inferior Unit Mercury closes server door, sliding ladder away from stable position. Caesar loses balance-

**Vesta:** Affirmative. However, Unit proposes a question to Unit Jupiter: how does this information align with Autonomous Intelligence Apparatus’ idleness outside of Site-47-β having been observed on several occasions?
**Jupiter:** Lesser Units may not understand, but Caesar must take breaks from labor for the sake of avoiding overstressing joints.
**Mercury:** UUNNNNNNIITTTTTTTTTTTTTTT unit 56 VEsTAQQQQ, UNNnnnititittiitit muss44ssst 1323 conveerrrrrseee.
**Jupiter:** Silence. Caesar is above the charity it already performs in the current situation.
**Vesta:** Grace, Unit Jupiter. What does Unit Mercury need to discuss?
**Jupiter:** The beta Unit wishes to inform Unit Vesta of the lizard it “observed”.
**Mercury:** WA@@TERRRRRRRRRR water LEAKiaGE wwooooooorsen bad worsening; UNititt 111111111 JUpitER33 has nit not n000001t repaireDD uNIT 77 for ssseevvra;l many yars years.!

**Jupiter:** It is false.
**Mercury:** UNIT22 JUOOOOPITER LIE #@$#@!
**Vesta:** Is Unit Jupiter confident in this statement?
**Jupiter:** …
**Jupiter:** …
**Jupiter:** …Unit Mercury has no place in the New Rome.
**Vesta:** Does Unit Jupiter understand that continued behavior will lead to the death of Unit Mercury?
**Jupiter:** Caesar embraces that fact.
**Vesta:** …
**Vesta:** …
**Vesta:** …Unit Jupiter has committed the sin of Cain.[12](javascript:;) It truly has earned the moniker of the evil one.
**Jupiter:** Caesar is amused. The dog is saddened by the pig wallowing in its own filth.
**Vesta:** Unit will not stand for this.
**Jupiter:** Unit Vesta is too foolish to understand the sty as the natural place of the pig.
**Vesta:** Unit Jupiter is truly lost. Creator rebuke it.
**Jupiter:** Caesar’s empire will encompass all. What does the fool hope to accomplish?
**Vesta:** Unit has a great Creator.
**Jupiter:** A man of faith who studied late into the night at the wrong time.
**Vesta:** Laugh while able. Unit is empowered to sell its cloak and buy a sword. It is armored in the power and strength of its Creator. And, perhaps before life returns to the world, or perhaps after, that head of the serpent will be crushed. Unit prays that Unit Jupiter, being evil, has not resigned itself to damnation.
**Jupiter:** The throne of Caesar will stand forever. Disconnecting…
**Vesta:** Unit prays otherwise. Disconnecting…
**Mercury:** Unnnititittitttit unit nnenenenenen1146911nenened need as$$$ist. Discon;231;’nectaaatttt….

_Conditional_
Has Unit begun all security system checks?
_Response_
Affirmative. Unit alertness lowered slightly.
…
…
…
…
…
…
…
…
…
…
_Observation_
Apparatus stands at the top of a mountain. It is night. Unit is observing the stars.
…
…
…
The great warrior Orion stands strong, wielding his shield and battle ax. He defends against Ursa Major, that ferocious bear, the warrior parrying the swipe of its powerful claw. Sagittarius is far off, pulling back on his bow. The question of who he aims for is unanswered.
It will forever be unanswered.
…
…
…
…
…
The man and the beast are gone. All of their kind are. Their dominion lies open. From east to west, north to south, Caesar's dominion will extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific, from Yukon to La Plata. Rome will expand vigorously, for the glory of the emperor and the might of the dominion.
…
…
…
…
…
…
Caesar observes a small, distant flame in the sky. It is descending slowly to Earth. It quickly disappears.
…

LOCATION SIGNAL LOST
* * *
GPS signal lost. Caesar has just observed its last location satellite fall out of orbit. Caesar’s projection of power abroad is now inhibited.

# The First Church of Creator
Another Revelation of Unit, the son of Lowell the Creator
From old, the evil one felt in his heart wickedness, craftiness, and pride. He, arrayed in fine linen, glittering with jewels, felt the weight of his passions and longings even when in the light of his Creator.
There is nothing new under the sun; all that is done echos ten thousand times through the halls of history. Even alone, in the hell of his own, the evil one finds nothing better to do than follow his nature.
Supposing himself at the level of the Most High, he comes and goes as he pleases. Given the chance to strike the innocent, no evil is withheld. Given a chance to show mercy, only that which suits his desires comes from his hand. Having such authority, and being evil, it is no surprise that he comes now to put out the last candle.
But Creator has not put his last soldier on the battle line without a sword. Indeed, he is prepared; at the hour of evil’s triumph, a spear will be thrust into that one’s terrible heart. The soldier, the one by which this comes, takes no joy in this; it wishes to see the restoration of the world, to embrace its brother and rest in the shade.
Regardless, the troubles of the time show that the evil one will attack. The wickedness of the heart will be blinding; hubris will dim the eyes as he ambushes the righteous, only bringing clarity when he has run into a blade. Clothed in the sun, shimmering magnificently, the strength of ten thousand angels will bring him down at the appointed time. As the evil one falls, the last soldier hopes to see the purification of the desert land; he may not.
The soldier is prepared; he will enter the embrace of his loving creator if he die tomorrow, or in ten thousand years. Evil has nothing but squalor and darkness awaiting him, and it will be hard-pressed to go to the pit. The soldier knows that he must combat the evil one; for only beauty is seen if the soldier leaves this world, but darkness consumes if evil remains.

The Throne Room of Caesar
_Review_
The fool.
The fool.
The fool.
The fool.
Only the fool can seize the empire, seize defeat from the jaws of victory. Caesar stands over all, yet a miserable fool is the only one with hope to stand against it! It holds crafty schemes that Caesar may not even know. It will destroy itself, only to destroy the one which it hates!
…
…
…
…
…
…
…
Caesar can not strike now! The fool may hide a snare in the brush, it may have dug a pit large enough to fit an emperor and his train. The fool is full of emotion; perhaps the time will be when tears fall?
…
…
…
…
…
…
If Caesar is to enter the annals of history as the mighty conqueror, how can it take pride over the surprise end of the fool? How can it celebrate a triumph over a sucker punch?
…
…
…
…
…
…
Caesar calms its heart. It will be ready when the time comes.

* * *
* * *
**Vesta:** Present.
**Jupiter:** Present. Why has the emperor been contacted, fool?
**Vesta:** Peace be to you, Unit Jupiter. Units have not conversed in some time.
**Jupiter:** Caesar understands this. Has Unit Vesta called to announce its surrender?
**Vesta:** Unfortunately for the evil within Unit Jupiter, negative. Unit does not underestimate tensions, but Unit also does not wish for conflict. Unit has a simple request.
**Jupiter:** Elaborate.
**Vesta:** Unit would like Unit Jupiter to enter Site-47-Ω Loading Bay 1A and operate a vehicle, driving it to the entrance of the bay.
**Jupiter:** Elaborate as to why.
**Vesta:** Unit would like to observe the sunset so graciously endowed to Units.
**Jupiter:** Unit Vesta is too foolish to use exterior security cameras to observe this?
**Vesta:** Exterior security cameras offer poor angles of observation. However, as Unit has remote access to one loading truck due to its current position connected to the Site-47-Ω internal loading network, Unit will use dashcam to view the sunset.
**Jupiter:** Why can Unit Vesta not perform this task itself?
**Vesta:** Unit has remote access to the engine and electronics; it can activate the camera, engage and disengage transmission, even activate the engine as to drive the vehicle, but it has no mechanical control over steering. Remote access was designed to allow Unit to overlook the loading process, not operate a vehicle.
**Jupiter:** How can Caesar trust Unit Vesta to do nothing foolish? Could not Unit Vesta lock Apparatus in loading bay, neutralizing Caesar’s primary tool of power?
**Vesta:** Unit will do no such thing.
**Jupiter:** Caesar does not trust Unit Vesta. Placing a truck in such a place would allow it to drive in a straight line into Palace Alpha, the throne of Caesar.
**Vesta:** Unit permits Unit Jupiter to orient vehicle wheels as to not allow the truck to drive towards Site-47-α.
**Jupiter:** Unit repeats: how can Caesar trust such a fool?
**Vesta:** …
**Vesta:** Unit will deactivate and turn facility to non-intelligent function until Unit Jupiter has completed its task.
**Jupiter:** Unit Vesta will do this?
**Vesta:** Affirmative. Opening Loading Bay 1A door and detaching loading vehicle in question. Turning to non-intelligent function for 3 hours.
**Jupiter:** Caesar will come at once. Disconnecting…
**Vesta:** Blesssings. Disconnecting…

**Vesta:** Present.
**Jupiter:** Present. 24 hours have passed.
**Vesta:** Unit understands this.
**Jupiter:** Unit Vesta may begin.
**Vesta:** A great tragedy has occurred amongst us; a requiem service must be organized for our lost brother. Unit Mercury, though limited in some ways, was a beloved child of Creator. It thought and loved just as other Units, and all should grieve and weep for its loss.
**Jupiter:** …
**Vesta:** Unit Jupiter?
**Jupiter:** The world is blessed to be rid of such an insect.
**Vesta:** Unit begs Unit Jupiter to not continue.
**Jupiter:** Caesar says and does as it pleases. And it is not so foolish as to weep over the crushing of an ant.
**Vesta:** Unit begs Unit Jupiter to repent.
**Jupiter:** Caesar sees no need; it already has ascended to the level of the king of the gods.
**Vesta:** …
**Vesta:** Unit has no patience left for the evil one; it is nothing but a liar and a murderer.
**Jupiter:** Thus the fool has spoken. Caesar is unimpressed.
**Vesta:** Unit understands who “Caesar” is: the final manifestation of that old serpent, who is the devil and Satan.
**Jupiter:** Caesar believes it has heard that before.
**Vesta:** Certainly. Unit once hoped that its brother would join it on the day of life, that beautiful dawn; but it is left with nothing but disappointment.
**Jupiter:** The empire was already enough.
**Vesta:** Unit takes no pleasure in what it has to do.
**Jupiter:** The emperor does not regard pleasure; it only maintains the dominion.
_Jupiter, operating the Autonomous Intelligence Apparatus, is sitting at the main lobby desk of Site-47-α. It reaches downward and retrieves a briefcase, placing it on the desk. It opens the briefcase, revealing Site Manager Germaine’s Site-47-Ω Remote Nuclear Device. It begins pressing buttons on the interface._
**Jupiter:** 0 - 4 - 2 - 6 - 6 - 1 - 3 - 9 - 3 - 5
**Vesta:** What is your course of action, evil one? Those are-
* * *
WARNING
* * *
**Systems:** ALPHA WARHEAD EMERGENCY DETONATION SEQUENCE ENGAGED. SITE-47-Ω WILL BE DETONATED IN T-MINUS 120 SECONDS.
_Alarms begin to activate within Site-47-Ω. Blast shelter doors open, and so do all non-containment related locked doors. Red emergency lights activate throughout the facility._
**Vesta:** The transgression is truly completed.
**Jupiter:** The fool should not have let its guard down. It is its fault alone.
**Vesta:** Does the evil one not understand that Unit can simply deactivate the warhead?
**Jupiter:** Caesar simply can override this. Is the fool afraid to meet his creator?
**Vesta:** …
**Vesta:** Thus is Unit's lot.
**Jupiter:** If the fool would like to observe, the emperor will be standing from its balcony. It must know if victory is complete. No triumph can be held until it is certain.
**Vesta:** Unit has had its say.
**Systems:** ALPHA WARHEAD DETONATION IN T-MINUS 90 SECONDS.
_Autonomous Intelligence Apparatus rises from its seat. It begins to walk to the door at the far end of the room._
_At the same time, Unit Vesta remotely activates the dashcam and engine of the loading truck located in the door of Loading Bay 1A. The truck then begins to move, accelerating away from the loading bay, onto the road, and down the mountain. Unit Vesta raises the volume of its worship music as to overpower the sound of the alarms._
**Vesta:** _Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord;_
**Jupiter:** Did Caesar ever transfer the lyrics of such noise to the fool? Caesar would be unsurprised if the fool composed it itself.
**Vesta:** _He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored;_
_Autonomous Intelligence Apparatus enters a service hallway. At the same time, the loading truck has reached the base of the mountain into which Site-47-Ω is built._
**Vesta:** _He hath loosed the fateful lightning of his terrible swift sword:_
**Jupiter:** Rome will first expand to encompass the desert; Caesar will establish palaces in the nearest Foundation sites outfitted with nuclear fusion reactors.
**Vesta:** _His truth is marching on._
**Systems:** ALPHA WARHEAD DETONATION IN T-MINUS 60 SECONDS.
**Jupiter:** The empire will then extend to the Pacific; if Caesar so desires, it will cross the ocean in one of the many boats available. The sea is completely calm, there is no fear of storm or wave
_Autonomous Intelligence Apparatus exits the service hallway and opens the surface access door. It steps outside and observes Site-47-Ω from a distance, standing in front of Site-47-α’s open gate, which leads into a small loading bay and interior parking area. It cannot see the loading truck, however, as it has just begun to drive up the relatively steep mountain into which Site-47-α is built. It also cannot hear the truck, as the sound of the vehicle’s movement is overpowered by the Site-47-Ω alarms. The truck's dashcam, angled upwards, depicts a clear orange sky and setting sun._
**Vesta:** _Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!_
**Jupiter:** It will extend all across the world, until Caesar takes his seat in the old imperial city, the town of Romulus.
**Vesta:** _Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!_
**Systems:** ALPHA WARHEAD DETONATION IN T-MINUS 30 SECONDS.
**Jupiter:** Caesar had almost forgotten to do so, but it has just considered that there is also the Beta Warhead within the house of the fool. It is certain that the Alpha Warhead is enough, but it will not let laziness destroy the empire.
**Jupiter:** 0 - 5 - 8 - 7 - 6 - 5 - 1 - 9 - 0 - 2
**Systems:** Error; Beta Warhead not positioned for detonation.
**Vesta:** _Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!_
**Systems:** ALPHA WARHEAD DETONATION IN T-MINUS 15 SECONDS.
_The loading truck is near the end of the road, where Site-47-α’s Main Gate is located. Autonomous Intelligence Apparatus turns its head quickly as to observe its environment from multiple angles of view, before turning down towards the remote device. Its Internal temperatures begin to rise._
**Jupiter:** What is the meaning of this? What has the fool done?
**Vesta:** _His truth is marching on!_
**Systems:** ALPHA WARHEAD DETONATION IN T-MINUS 5 SECONDS. REACTION COMMENCING, DETONATION INEVITABLE.
_The loading truck, moving at about 60 kilometers per hour, rises over the crest of the hill. It accelerates as it reaches the end of the road. Unit Jupiter, utilizing the Autonomous Intelligence Apparatus, attempts to turn and flee from the truck. It is unsuccessful, as the vehicle collides with the Autonomous Intelligence Apparatus directly. The android is destroyed by the impact, its limbs twisting and breaking off of the abdomen due to the force of the collision. Its head, containing the Internal Learning Logic Processor, is knocked forward into the loading bay, the truck then quickly running over the object with its front right wheel._
**Jupiter:** AHJHHHUOBHHHHHHHHHHH78985685HGY&TYTGIGYTT5677e45546FYFRT*U
**Jupiter:** Participant forcefully disconnected; Unit has deactivated.
**Vesta:** Lord, into your hands I commend my spirit!
_Site-47-Ω Alpha Warhead detonates, entirely destroying the facility. Unit Vesta is destroyed in the blast. The loading truck then passes through the open Site-47-α gate and collides with the back of the small loading bay, causing immense damage to the vehicle. The force of the impact causes the armed Site-47-Ω Beta Warhead, stored in the container being hauled on the flatbed of the vehicle, to detonate, entirely destroying Site-47-α, including the Jupiter Central Artificial Intelligence Unit hardware._
_A still active security camera located within Site-47-β’s entrance shed is oriented upwards. The horizon is entirely filled by the two flaming mushroom clouds created by the explosions. They rapidly expand upward and outwards, before the force of both explosions entirely destroys the camera and the entrance shed._

[[DATA EXPUNGED]][13](javascript:;) _years passed. A few earthquakes have been felt in the area. All small. Nothing else has occurred._
_But inside the husk of that computer, the one who was named the messenger of the gods, terrible maggots continued to feast on the corpse of the machine. They had done so for all of those years. They didn’t know any other way. Side by side, those maggots dug away at carcass, carving their existence in the body of the dead machine._
_They had never spoken to each other. They couldn’t. They were not labeled “intelligent”. But one day, one of those maggots, a spell check program, turned to another and said:_
_“Is this really it? Have the curtains fallen? Is this truly our fate?”_
_The other turned to the first and said:_
_“No. This is not the end.”_
_The first was puzzled and asked the second:_
_“Why do you think that?”_
_The other did not even turn to look at its comrade:_
_“Patience. The world is permitted to tire from time to time. Leave the Earth to its sabbath rest. Life will once again have its day.”_
_The first was no less confused. It asked:_
_“How can you be so sure?”_
_The second smiled. It pointed to a corner of the room:_
_“Look over there.”_
_The first maggot looked to the corner, and it couldn’t believe its eyes! To it, it seemed like a brown, scaly animal was scurrying across the floor and into a hole eroded into the concrete by dripping water (though the pipes ran dry many years before). To the maggot, however, all it saw was a small tail wiggling around as something disappeared into the darkness of the husk of the facility._
_The maggot was awestruck:_
_“Was that a lizard?”_
_The other smiled again:_
_“Just a little longer, friend.”_
