Listen, I don’t know where your head’s at right now, you don’t sound great, but listen. You’re doing fine, and nobody’s gonna fuck us over. Alright? You hear me? Jesus. You take yourself so seriously sometimes. Like lightening up once in a while would kill you!

SCP-6432-1

Item #:

 SCP-6432

Object Class:

 Safe

Special Containment Procedures:

 SCP-6432 and SCP-6432-1 are currently stored in adjoining object containment lockers at Site-51. Personnel surveilling SCP-6432's containment locker are to be changed every 2 weeks. Direct physical contact with SCP-6432 is not permitted except during testing. Individuals who make direct contact with SCP-6432 are to remain isolated under surveillance for 15 days, or until SCP-6432's effect wears off. All but 1 SCP-6432-1 instance have been incinerated.

Description:

 SCP-6432 is the corpse of an avian creature, measuring 110cm from beak to tail, with wingspans of 130cm, 80cm and 50cm. While superficially resembling a bird in most respects, SCP-6432 differs in that it has six wings and no legs. Limited accounts prior to its termination observed it moving when on the ground by hopping on the 10cm talons found at the elbow joint of each wing. These 6 talons and SCP-6432’s beak are significantly sharper than the talons of ordinary birds of

prey.

SCP-6432 exerts an anomalous effect on any living creature that comes into direct physical contact with it. Physical contact with the anomaly induces intense visual hallucinations, usually of flora and fauna typical of where the victim grew up, or other locations associated with significant memories. In addition to the hallucinations, the victim experiences disembodied sensory input, most commonly through only one sense. Examples of reported experiences are as follows:

Smelling woody or floral scents

Hearing indistinct speech or whispering, often perceived as very nearby

Feeling weather inconsistent with the victim's physical location

SCP-6432-1 instances are the corpses of SCP-6432's victims, carrying pseudo-portals in all areas of the body fed upon by SCP-6432. These pseudo-portals appear as areas of bright, prismatic light, and when viewed through a specialized lens, act as windows to a hereto unidentified forested area. Five SCP-6432-1 instances were discovered in SCP-6432's initial area of destabilized reality, with pseudo-portals located in the facial and chest regions. It is hypothesized that SCP-6432 attacked the eyes first, as suggested by the most fully realized portals always being located in the region of the corpse's eye sockets, and as observed firsthand during the

attempted

recovery of the anomaly.

History:

 SCP-6432 was discovered as the source of a small splinter reality centered on an abandoned house near Millinocket, Maine. Mobile Task Force Lambda-5 (“White Rabbits”) was assigned to investigate but failed to return the anomaly

alive.

RECOVERY LOG TRANSCRIPT

Team Lead:

 Commander Steven Conley

Team Members:

 Ryan Powell, Katherine Reid, Alexa Hewitt, Ira Watts

NOTE:

 Video footage from is taken from Agent Powell's body camera, as other footage suffered became heavily corrupted as a result of SCP-6432's unreality field.

Conley:

 Comms check.

Reid:

 Check.

Powell:

 Hoo-rah.

Hewitt:

 Check.

Watts:

 Check.

Conley:

 Sounds good. Ready?

Reid:

 Born ready!

Conley:

 We're the first people to get a look at this thing. We don't know what we're in for in there, so keep an eye out for illusions.

Powell:

 Gonna appear as everybody's worst fear. Like Pennywise.

Reid:

 Wow, Powell, you'll get to see your dad for once!

Hewitt:

 Nice.

Powell:

 Fuck off, Reid, you're- you're 

short.

Reid:

 I admit, I'm not half as tall as the stories you tell about the size of your-

Powell:

 Hey!

Hewitt:

 Burn.

Conley:

 Awfully liberal with your 8 allotted words of the day, are we, Hewitt?

Hewitt:

 Mm.

Conley:

 You good, Thirteen?

Watts:

 I'm fine.

Conley:

 Great. Eyes up, everybody. Don't fall for any tricks. Reid and Hewitt, with me. Powell, take the upper South hall. Watts, go with Powell. I want you on the highest vantage point you can get with that sniper, just in case.

Watts:

 Got it.

Powell:

 Loud and clear.

[Lambda-5 splits accordingly.]

[The interior of the house is seemingly larger on the inside than the outside, either by illusion or unreality. Plant life grows through the walls and floor.]

Powell:

 We found a staircase. Heading- well, heading sideways. See you at the top-or-bottom.

Conley:

 Roger that.

[Footage corrupted, staircase only partially visible.]

Watts:

 Ugh. I hate when they do things like this.

Powell:

 Don’t we all, newbie?

Watts:

 I’ve been here longer than Reid AND Hewitt.

Powell:

 Coulda fooled me.

Watts:

 I've never choked.

Powell:

 First time for everything.

Reid:

 Leave him alone, Powell. Jesus.

Watts:

 First time for you to actually hit a shot, too.

Conley:

 You can chat in the van, boys. Focus.

Watts:

 Sorry.

Powell:

 Got it.

Reid:

 Conley, I found something. A body, most likely.

Conley:

 Move in. Carefully.

Hewitt:

 Anchors ready?

Conley:

 Naturally.

Reid:

 Confirming life signs; negative.

Hewitt:

 His face.

[Agent Powell enters an open hall with a high ceiling. Several walls have closed wooden doors.]

Reid:

 Looks like something was eating it.

Hewitt:

 It's 

bright.

Conley:

 I’m reading big numbers from that. Minimal interaction for now. Don’t look too hard at it.

Reid:

 Copy. Tagging it now.

Hewitt:

 Remember that portal? From ███████████.

Reid:

 It 

does

 kinda look like that.

[A door slams directly behind Agent Powell.]

[Agent Powell turns around. The area behind him, previously the top of the staircase, is now a solid, flat wall. Agent Watts is not visible on camera.]

Hewitt:

 Hey, Conley?

Watts:

 Powell, a door just shut on me. Can you grab it?

Powell:

 What door? There’s no door. Where are you?

Conley:

 Eyes up, everybody, we have spacial fluctuations. Keep moving and keep those anchors ready.

Watts:

 Powell has the anchor.

Powell:

 Yeah, Watts doesn’t have one.

Reid:

 I don’t have one, either.

Hewitt:

 I’ve got you, Reid.

Conley:

 Watts, your priority is to find your way back to Powell, got it?

Watts:

 Got it.

[Agent Powell's camera angles down to a male corpse, face entirely missing. White light shines from the wound.]

Powell:

 Hey, is that dead body of yours glowing?

Hewitt:

 Just the- bite holes.

Powell:

 Then I’ve got another one over here.

Conley:

 Tag any you find and get back to Watts, Powell.

Reid:

 Found a third one.

Watts:

 Holy shit.

Conley:

 Find a fourth one?

[Agent Powell pauses as he waits for a response.]

Powell:

 Respond, Watts.

Watts:

 There’s a kid in here.

Conley:

 Do you have eyes on the anomaly?

Watts:

 It’s just a kid, Powell-

Conley:

 Careful, Watts, certain things tend to do that.

Watts:

 I know what I’m looking at, alright?!

Reid:

 Watts, stay where you are, don’t agitate it-

Watts:

 Hey, it’s okay.

[Brief noise from Agent Watts's microphone, voice sounds slightly distant.]

Watts:

 See? Not gonna hurt you. I’m here to get you out of here safe, alright?

Reid:

 …Did you just take your helmet off?

Powell:

 Jesus Christ, Watts, put your fucking helmet on!

[Powell has begun running through the hall, quickly checking doors.]

[Each door seems to open to an unseen portal, Agent Powell visible from different angles through each.]

Watts:

 She’s just a kid! I don’t want to scare her!

Conley:

 Put your helmet on now, Watts, that is an order!

Reid:

 I have eyes on the anomaly! And on Watts! Repeat, eyes on the anomaly!

Hewitt:

 Anchor it, Reid!

Reid:

 I don’t have one!

Powell:

 Then wound it!

Watts:

 I’m not shooting a fucking child!

Reid:

 That is NOT a child, Watts!

Watts:

 I've got this under-

MISSION STATUS: FAILURE

was it me

Note: While the termination of SCP-6432 deemed the mission a failure, the new anomalous properties exhibited by the creature’s corpse necessitated recovering the body. MTF Lambda-5 members were quarantined following exposure to SCP-6432’s effect. Following termination of SCP-6432, Medical extraction was ordered for Agent Watts. Left arm amputated above the elbow. Left eye socket [REDACTED]

VIDEO TRANSCRIPT

Taken from Site-19 infirmary surveillance equipment

[BEGIN LOG]

Reid:

 Hey.

Watts:

 Hey.

[10 second pause]

Reid:

 How's it feeling?

Watts:

 Hurts.

Reid:

 Are you all-right?

Watts:

 Ha ha.

Reid:

 It's funny, admit it. You're gonna get so much mileage out of that joke. Might as well start now.

Watts:

 It didn't get my trigger finger so you'd better watch yourself.

[Reid chuckles.]

Watts:

 What did Conley say?

Reid:

 Uh, 6 months to a year.

Watts:

 Oh. That's not as bad as I was expecting.

Reid:

 They need to make sure nothing else is going to happen to your eye.

Watts:

 Makes sense.

[15 second pause.]

Watts:

 …What's wrong?

Reid:

 You're not coming back to Lambda-5.

Watts:

 What?!

Reid:

 You're not fit for duty, Watts.

Watts:

 Yeah, not now, but 6 months? That's a long time. My face'll be healed by then, Conley can get me one of those bionic arms, the really high-grade ones they use with-

Reid:

 They're talking about decommissioning you.

[27 second pause]

Watts:

 No.

Reid:

 I'm sorry.

Watts:

 No, I can be better. I know what I did wrong.

Reid:

 You're half blind, you have one arm.

Watts:

 I can make it work.

Reid:

 No, Watts, you can't.

Watts:

 On ANY force?

Reid:

 I don't know. They didn't sound favorable toward it.

Watts:

 This is the only thing I know how to do, Reid! This is all I've got, where else am I supposed to go? What, I screw up 

once

 and it blows my chances forever?

Reid:

 I'll help you find something-

Watts:

 No. I'm not done. Tell Conley I'm coming back. Once I'm healed I'll requisition one of the advanced prosthetics and I WON'T fuck it up again, I 

promise

-

Reid:

 We already voted on it.

Watts:

 Do I get a vote? Between you, me and Hewitt I could-

Reid:

 It was unanimous.

[33 second pause]

Reid:

 I almost watched you die once. I'm not going to your funeral.

Watts:

 Do you think it was my fault?

Reid:

 What?

Watts:

 The mission. Do you think it was my fault?

Reid:

 I never said that.

Watts:

 DO you?

Reid:

 No. I don't think it was your fault.

Watts:

 No, 'cause I'm sick of the rest of the team lying to my face about the elephant in the room, you know that?

Reid:

 What are you talking about?

Watts:

 "13A."

Reid:

 Watts-

Watts:

 I know you all think I'm the weak link. You're not exactly subtle.

Reid:

 You're not a "weak link."

Watts:

 No? Then what am I? All it had to do was look like a kid!

Reid:

 It wasn't your fault, okay? You're in qualifying parameters for the team, and you have plenty of skills that-

Watts:

 It was me. I fucked up. 

I

 botched the mission.

Reid:

 It wasn't your goddamn fault, Watts!

Watts:

 You don't believe that!

Reid:

 What do you want me to say?!

Watts:

 I want you to admit I'm the weak link!

Reid:

 No!

Watts:

 Say it!

Reid:

 YES!

FINE!

YOU

ARE!

You're

the

fucking

weak

link!

You

fucked

up

the

mission

because

you

just

couldn't

hack

it

this

time.

But

it's

not

you,

it's

just

how

your

head

works,

and

that's

not

your

fault.

You're

not

made

for

this

and

you

never

were.

I

tried

to

get

you

transferred

to

a

different

force

for

months,

one

that

you'd

be

better

in,

but

you're

the

best

marksman

we've

had

in

years

and

Conley

didn't

want

to

let

you

go.

This

was

always

how

it

was

going

to

end

up.

It's

a

fucking

miracle

that

you

survived.

I

like

you.

I've

always

liked

working

with

you.

I

care

about

you.

But

you

don't

belong

here.

You

are

weak,

Ira.

And

you're

soft.

But

it

isn't

your

fault.

They

set

you

up

for

failure

from

the

start.

[57 second pause]

Watts:

 I did my best, Kit-

Reid:

 I wish your best had been enough this time.

[26 second pause]

Reid:

 Jesus. I didn't mean that. I'm sorry. I haven't slept in like, four days-

Watts:

 Why didn’t you just shoot me?

Reid:

 …Excuse me?

Watts:

 We’re supposed to prioritize the anomaly. You could have brought it back alive.

Reid:

 Yeah? Well-

[9 second pause]

Reid:

 Maybe you're not the only weak link.

Watts:

 You would have saved me the trouble.

Reid:

 Ira, so help me God-

Watts:

 I was joking. Mostly.

Reid:

 I will put you on watch. Try me.

Watts:

 What, like revenge for when I put YOU on watch?

[5 second pause. Reid chuckles.]

Reid:

 Yeah.

[7 second pause.]

Reid:

 Besides, the fuck do they need another magic bird for? You're more valuable anyway.

[Watts snorts.]

Watts:

 What, to the Foundation?

Reid:

 No.

[20 second pause.]

Watts:

 I don’t know what to do, Kit…

Reid:

 Same as the rest of us,

I

guess.
