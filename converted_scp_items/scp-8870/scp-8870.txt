DESCRIPTION

 

Hydrochloric acid retrieved from site of Incident 8870-Œ±.

SCP-8870 designates a humanoid entity of roughly 173 centimeters in height; age, weight and ethnicity yet unidentified. The entity possesses the anomalous capability to generate large amounts of hydrochloric acid within a given subject‚Äôs body via observation.

Further information about the entity is contained in the attached appendices.

 

APPENDIX [8870-001] - History

 

First recorded activity of SCP-8870 was on 05/13/2024, when Mr. Karl Uzbekki, a known member of GoI-019 (‚Äù

The Serpent‚Äôs Hand

‚Äù),

2

 heavily advocating for anti-Foundation and 

Global Occult Coalition

3

 sentiments online. Uzbekki was found deceased in his apartment, due to acid exposure in internal organs.

4

 Although residents reported no abnormal sounds or sightings, a security camera situated within Uzbekki‚Äôs residence showed the presence of a hooded humanoid figure.

The second encounter of the entity was on 12/04/2024, when a church service of GoI-004 (‚Äù

Church of the Broken God

‚Äù) ended in the deaths of six attendees. Surviving attendees reported the presence of a hooded figure in the back rows of the church.

The final sighting of SCP-8870, as of 01/10/2025, occurred on 01/03/2025, during the presidential election speech of Ms. Tori Fr√†nk, culminating into Incident 8870-Œ±. A recording of the event is located in Appendix [8870-002].

 

APPENDIX [8870-002]

 

INCIDENT 8870-Œ±

DATE:

 01/03/2025

LOCATION:

 Central Park, New York City, New York

FOREWORD:

 Incident occurred during the presidential election speech of Ms. Tori Fr√†nk.

Ms. Fr√†nk had advocated heavily against the practices of the SCP Foundation, the Global Occult Coalition and particularly 

Marshall, Carter & Dark

.

5

 She had also donated USD$ 300,000 to the 

Manna Charitable Foundation

 for their ‚ÄùSAVING EARTH‚Äù program.

[BEGIN RECORDING]

 

<Tori Fr√†nk walks onto the podium. Over a hundred attendees begin loudly cheering and clapping. They are carrying hand-made signs displaying anti-Foundation and Global Occult Coalition sentiments. Ms. Fr√†nk gives out waves and kisses, before settling on the podium.>

<She gestures for the crowd to quiet down, which it promptly does.>

FR√ÄNK:

 I feel honored to be standing here today. Really, it means very much to me. Without you, hundreds of supernaturally-abled‚Äî

 

<SCP-8870 is observed approaching the front of the crowd by security camera feeds.>

 

FR√ÄNK:

 ‚Äîwould be locked-up in a cell, just for the reason that they were born. There are forces out there that wish nothing more for an innocent child to be-

 

<SCP-8870 arrives at the front of the crowd. Its face is obscured by a large hood.>

 

FR√ÄNK:

 ‚Äîtaken away by their families. Innocents suffered, and continue to suffer, from evils that have lurked in the shadows for centuries. Organizations that have oppressed the rights of animals and fellow people without the public‚Äôs knowledge, up until three decades ago!

FR√ÄNK:

 We‚Äôve gathered here today to say ‚Äôno‚Äô to these oppressive regimes that dare make our choices for us. That dare say they do these inhumane experiments, and call it protection! We stand against these things! The Foundation, the Coalition ‚Äî all of them! 

We stand against!

 

<Loud cheering and clapping.>

 

CROWD:

 

We stand against! We stand against!

 

<Tori Fr√†nk smiles at the crowd. Change in behavior in Fr√†nk is noted, when she clutches her chest, wincing.>

<Fr√†nk collapses onto the floor. The crowd quiets down, looking onto the scene visibly confused.>

<Security details approach Fr√†nk. She coughs out blood, which lands on the floor.>

 

GUARD 1:

 Shit‚Ä¶

GUARD 2:

 We need a medic!

 

<Attendees still look around, confused. SCP-8870 remains at the front, near motionless.>

<Hydrochloric acid spills out of Tori Fr√†nk‚Äôs chest cavity. A gaping wound juts out from where her chest and clothes formerly were.>

<The crowd descends into a panic. Hundreds of attendees vacate the area, some inflicting heavy injuries to each other in the ensuing chaos. Mobile Task Force Pi-1 is dispatched to the area, but are unable to arrive in time to apprehend the entity.>

FOUNDATION ASSASSINATES PARANORMAL LEAD FIGURE

PARANORMAL SCENE SHOOK TO THE CORE

‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ

New York City, NY -

 Yesterday the entire paranormal community was shook with a senseless act of violence at the candidate of presidency, Tori Fr√†nk. Mid-way through her speech, hundreds of supporters watched their symbol of hope turn into a slurry of blood and viscera by an unidentified perpetrator.

 

 

Although major organizations in the paranormal scene have denied any involvement in the death of Tori Fr√†nk, numerous people online and on the streets have voiced their concerns for the future of the paranormal in day-to-day life.

, yet here they are shooting down a political head. Hypocrites‚Ä¶ [‚Ä¶]‚Äù

 

The Foundation has denied all involvement, while the Global Occult Coalition has yet to give an official statement. The 

Unusual Incidents Unit

 of the FBI has stated to investigate these matters further. ‚Äù[‚Ä¶] rest assured that the UIU will find the perpetrator of such a senseless crime [‚Ä¶] and bring them to justice!‚Äù UIU captain Victor Freffrson says regarding these matters.

 

Speculations about the possible involvement of the radical terrorist cell the Chaos Insurgency in the assassination have arisen alongside other rumors. Abu Ogondo, a Foundation researcher, has been cleared to discuss any questions at a later

Yeah, WATCHERS! Shadow‚Äôs BACK from vacation; and not a second late. as you all well know, Tori Fr√†nk was MURKED yesterday in Central Park, NYC. Police say it was acid in her stomach, assailant ‚Äôunidentified‚Äô, so the media says at least.

What if I were to tell who the assailant was? And it just so happens to be the same shady ass shadow organization that‚Äôs been ooerating behind our backs the whole time? And what if I told you Tori Frank died to an OVEREXPOSURE to BRAIN WAVES? Don‚Äôt believe me? See this:

Testing out the waters, until releasing the BIG GUNS with whatever the fuck Elon‚Äôs been sending into space as of late. Mindless meat puppets, sleep-walking all day long

And Tori Fr√†nk is just the beginning. Soon, ig could be your mum, your dad, your wife, or maybe even your pet hamster! WE WILL NOT BE SLAVES!.

PROJECT PROPOSAL

DATE:

 01/16/2025

CODENAME:

 ‚ÄùGREY MATTER‚Äù

PROPOSED BY:

 Dr. Hakari Mimko

 

I could sugarcoat this, but I‚Äôm not going to. Partly because all of the data is everywhere on the world-wide web, but mostly because a lot of innocent people‚Äôs lives are getting tits-up, just because they work for this organization.

The truth of the matter is: The public hates us ‚Äî 

has been

 hating us ever since the glorious fuck-up over there in the East. And although that piece of the world did eventually come back, the millions of people on that piece did not. Everyone blamed us. Hell, some of the scientists and soldiers involved in the operation even blamed themselves. One to the heart, the other to the brain.

What people always seem to forget is that, although it was a tragedy, there was a reason for that tragedy. We didn‚Äôt just send North Korea up into another, inhospitable dimension without reason, but because it was our way of sparing billions more. As hard as it might be to believe this, we saved the world that day. We make the hard, downright unethical and cruel decisions, so that others don‚Äôt have to. We always did.

Which brings us again to 8870. The acid person, if it is human at all. This entity has been specifically targeting pro-anomaly figures in the public, making an example out of them; we don‚Äôt know why, given they are apparently anomalous themselves, but we do know to what purpose. It‚Äôs to rile up the masses into hating the Foundation. Even more than before.

Everywhere in the world, you see signs that say ‚ÄùFUCK THE FOUNDATION‚Äù or ‚ÄùCONTAINMENT is NOT PROTECTION‚Äù, or other similar stuff. On your way to work, on the radio, or some pop-up ad on your favorite porn site. They‚Äôre everywhere. And that is a problem. Suddenly, one looney-bin conspiracy theorist turns into dozens of looney-bin conspiracy theorists. Then a hundred, then a thousand ‚Äî and that‚Äôs where the issues start to emerge.

It goes without saying that the last thing the Foundation needs is animal rights activists arriving at Site-19‚Äôs doors, advocating for the rights of 

682

.

Back to 8870, and the founding of the GREY MATTER Division. I propose the division to handle what the public cannot: Information. My team will sow any hateful regards toward the Foundation and feed the public new information that paints us as a necessary evil, like the sweet little free-thinkers they are.

We will make sure, 24/7, that the damage done by SCP-8870 will be repaired overnight. That no harm may stay. For the betterment of the world. For the greater good. For my sister and people like her out there.

I hope you take these words to heart, Overseers.

MEETING 8870-A

DATE:

 01/20/2025

LOCATION:

 [REDACTED]

FOREWORD:

 Meeting of personnel in GREY MATTER Division. Led by Dr. Hakari Mimko.

[BEGIN RECORDING]

 

<Three figures sit at a small round table. Sunlight shines through the windows into the conference room, which is on the second floor of the facility.>

<Various miscellaneous objects are strewn about, such as chairs, tables, sofas, mannequins and mirrors, amongst other objects.>

<The three figures are, from left to right, Dr. Laura Schneider, Senior Technician Dohn Cavollo and Dr. Hakari Mimko.>

<Dr. Mimko looks at her wristwatch repeatedly, also looking in uneven intervals across the room and door. The others notice this behavior.>

 

CAVOLLO:

 Excuse me, ma‚Äôam. Wasn‚Äôt the meeting supposed to start four minutes ago?

MIMKO:

 

(sighs)

 Yes. We‚Äôre short one member.

SCHNEIDER:

 Where are they?

MIMKO:

 If I‚Äôd know, I‚Äôd have told you already.

 

<Silence.>

 

MIMKO:

 Look‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sorry, Ms. Schneider‚Äî

SCHNEIDER:

 Doctor.

MIMKO:

 ‚Äîthis whole topic is very dear to my heart‚Ä¶ Can‚Äôt afford any hiccups.

 

<Silence. Two more minutes pass without incident.>

<Cavollo and Schneider grow more disinterested by the minute. Cavollo pulls out his mobile phone, while Schneider examines her nails.>

<Dr. Mimko stands up, straightens her coat and walks over to the overhead projector at the opposite end of the room. Cavollo puts his phone away and Schneider focuses up.>

 

MIMKO:

 So, as our last member couldn‚Äôt make it in time, we‚Äôll just begin without them.

 

<She turns the lights off and the projector on. An image of Tori Fr√†nk is shown on the far wall.>

<Cavollo and Schneider straighten up in their seats.>

 

MIMKO:

 We all know her. Tori Fr√†nk. Mother of three, 53, liked pottery‚Äî

CAVOLLO:

 Wait, what? I didn‚Äôt know‚Äî

MIMKO:

 

(raises voice)

 ‚ÄîAnd we all know what happened to her.

 

<An image of Tori Fr√†nk‚Äôs remains are shown, partially dissolving through the floor. Cavollo is seen turning away, muttering expletives in Spanish. Schneider remains in her position.>

 

MIMKO:

 Her death shook the anomalous community. They didn‚Äôt take kindly to their figure of hope being turned into a slurry paste. And with the identity of the 

true

 assailant unknown, they turned to us, as you might‚Äôve noticed with the increasing‚Ä¶ 

hate

 at Foundation personnel.

CAVOLLO:

 Just this month I got three shoeboxes delivered to my adress with a dead rat in it. I‚Äôd be utterly disgusted, if they weren‚Äôt so unoriginal. 

Hijos de puta!

SCHNEIDER:

 If I may interrupt, Doctor‚Ä¶

MIMKO:

 Dr. Mimko.

SCHNEIDER:

 Dr. Mimko, why are you telling us all this?

 

<She puts another image onto the projector. The words ‚ÄùGREY MATTER DIVISION‚Äù are superimposed over a grey brain in black bold letters.>

<The other members look at the image extensively.>

 

MIMKO:

 The GREY MATTER Division. 

(paces around table)

 Our job will be to produce media that‚Äôs exclusively pro-Foundation. From memes to videos, movies, TV shows, games, books, pornography ‚Äî anything for the public to love us again.

 

<Cavollo raises a hand.>

 

CAVOLLO:

 Why are we doing all of this? I mean, hasn‚Äôt the Foundation operated without the public‚Äôs knowledge longer than my grammie‚Äôs been suckling the air out of this Earth? Why is it so concerned about the public now?

 

<Dr. Mimko approaches Cavollo.>

 

MIMKO:

 Because the next 

people-elected

 president might not be so lenient with the Foundation. Higher taxes would be the least we had to worry about then. And, trust me, we do not want to go down 

that path

.

 

<Silence. Dr. Mimko walks back toward the head of the table.>

 

CAVOLLO:

 

(mutters)

 So this is how the Foundation dies‚Ä¶ with rageful X-users.

SCHNEIDER:

 Okay, I do 

not

 want another 

Star Wars

 reference in this room.

CAVOLLO:

 I‚Äôm sorry! It seemed appropriate!

SCHNEIDER:

 What made you think it was appropriate?

CAVOLLO:

 Look, I said I‚Äôm sorry!

 

<Dr. Mimko gives out a long exhale, rubbing her temple.>

 

SCHNEIDER:

 So, we know what our jobs are, but why are we 

specifically

 here?

MIMKO:

 

Your

 job is to keep in touch with the current generation. Come up with a flurry of ideas to keep their young minds stimulated for longer than 10 seconds. While you 

(points at Cavollo)

 will be producing this stuff. Send it right into the masses.

CAVOLLO:

 Okay. Great. Where‚Äôs my team?

MIMKO:

 

(pauses)

 You‚Äôre looking right at it.

CAVOLLO:

 

(pauses)

 Where?

MIMKO:

 We‚Äôre a quartett‚Äî well, trio, as of right now.

SCHNEIDER:

 Wait‚Äî

 

<Chair scrapes against the floor. Dr. Schneider walks up to Dr. Mimko.>

 

SCHNEIDER:

 We‚Äôre all that there is?

MIMKO:

 Short one member, but, yes.

SCHNEIDER:

 

(scoffs)

 I‚Äôm done. I‚Äôm 

done

.

 

<Dr. Schneider moves to the door.>

 

MIMKO:

 Dr. Schneider‚Äî

 

<Agent Henrik Duvall enters the room. He looks around quietly, before settling on an empty seat. He watches the proceedings with mild disinterest.>

 

MIMKO:

 ‚Äîyou were hand-picked for this project, due to your expertise and skill.

 

<Dr. Schneider stops in her tracks. Agent Duvall checks his phone.>

 

SCHNEIDER:

 Picked by whom?

O5-11:

 

(via intercom)

 By me.

CAVOLLO:

 Jesus!

 

<Concerned faces, except for Dr. Mimko. Even Agent Duvall is looking up from his phone.>

 

O5-11:

 Golly. This first meeting‚Äôs going great!

SCHNEIDER:

 Who are you?

O5-11:

 Oh, you know, just that voice in your heads to tell you to shut the fuck up and listen to your team leader for a second, that‚Äôs all.

CAVOLLO:

 Are you a Director?

O5-11:

 More than that. I‚Äôm an Overseer. And now that I‚Äôve told y‚Äôall, I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôll have to terminate you all‚Äî

 

<Concerned faces.>

 

O5-11:

 ‚Äîbut I‚Äôve heard the Foundation doesn‚Äôt like to do that anymore, so I‚Äôll just ask you kindly to bash your brains in to forget we ever had this conversation!

SCHNEIDER:

 Lord, help me‚Ä¶

O5-11:

 Daddy upstairs didn‚Äôt come down when his son was put on a stick. I doubt he‚Äôll come for you, my love.

MIMKO:

 If I may interject. O5-11, as his title might suggest, will oversee our operations. This entire operation isn‚Äôt strictly‚Ä¶ official.

CAVOLLO & SCHNEIDER:

 Excuse me?

O5-11:

 Jinxed!

MIMKO:

 I proposed the project to the Council, which they denied. But O5-11 kindly offered me to go through with it anyway.

CAVOLLO:

 Why?

MIMKO:

 Clas‚Äî

O5-11:

 Classified, motherfucker!

MIMKO:

 ‚Ä¶ yes.

 

<Silence.>

 

CAVOLLO:

 Now what?

O5-11:

 Now, you do your pretty little jobs, and save the world, or whatever. Miss Mimko over here said that my ol‚Äô partners, the GOC, got something to do with it.

MIMKO:

 Would fit their MO.

 

<The intercom system disconnects.>

<Dr. Schneider is about to leave. Dr. Mimko grabs her by the wrist.>

 

MIMKO:

 Please. We need you.

SCHNEIDER:

 Let me go‚Äî

MIMKO:

 Without you, this entire operation would fail. There is no other option. Please.

 

<Dr. Schneider hesitates for a moment.>

 

SCHNEIDER:

 You‚Äôre pathetic.

 

<Dr. Schneider returns to her seat at the conference table. Dr. Mimko lets out an audible exhale.>

 

MIMKO:

 Good‚Ä¶ now that that‚Äôs settled, we can begin‚Äî

DUVALL:

 If I may interrupt.

 

<Dr. Mimko turns to look at Agent Duvall.>

 

DUVALL:

 Why is there a badly photoshopped brain with words in the 

Comic Sans

 font over it on the wall?

 

<7 minutes, 34 seconds of extraneous footage removed.>

MISSION LOG 8870-1

DATE:

 01/22/2025

LOCATION:

 [REDACTED]

FOREWORD:

 To gain more insight into Incident 8870-Œ±, a meeting with D.C. al Fine of the Global Occult Coalition was arranged. The following is a log of the operation, Agent Henrik Duvall attending, with Dr. Hakari Mimko overseeing via concealed body-camera.

[BEGIN RECORDING]

 

<Agent Duvall arrives at the location. It is that of an elementary school, completely empty. There is a black van with the words ‚ÄùFLOWER SHOP‚Äù printed on the side.>

<Duvall takes a look around, before exiting the vehicle. A light breeze passes him by.>

 

DUVALL:

 This place?

MIMKO:

 

(through earpiece)

 What of it?

DUVALL:

 No, it‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ and the van? Even the UIU would be more conspicuous.

MIMKO:

 Just go in, agent.

 

<Duvall approaches the front entrance. Various small carton figures of Santa Claus are attached to the interior of the glass pane with duct-tape.>

 

MIMKO:

 Open the door.

 

<Duvall pulls on the doors, which do not budge. He pushes them and the doors move open.>

<He walks through the hallways of the school building. Each room that he passes the door is closed shut. He passes one whose door is wide open; a man sits at a desk with a black briefcase laying to his side.>

 

 

<Duvall eyes the man and the room, before carefully entering.>

 

MAN:

 Ah, yes, Mr. Duvall. Please, take a seat.

 

<The man gestures to the chair opposite him. Duvall takes a seat, shifting on it slightly.>

 

MAN:

 You are Mr. Duvall, yes?

DUVALL:

 I am. Who are you?

MAN:

 Oh, apologies. I am D.C. al Fine‚Äôs representative. She unfortunately couldn‚Äôt come personally.

DUVALL:

 What, too busy?

MAN:

 No, no. It‚Äôs just with the recent, well, controversy surrounding the Foundation, she wanted to be safe. I hope you take no offense in this.

DUVALL:

 ‚Ä¶ No.

MAN:

 Very well. Let us waste no more time.

 

<Agent Duvall takes a look around. The room is an ordinary classroom, with boards, desks, chairs and images of the students and their birthdays pinned to the walls.>

 

MAN:

 You have come alone, yes?

DUVALL:

 

(gestures at himself)

 As alone as one can be.

MAN:

 You know I can smell that body-camera on you.

 

<Duvall‚Äôs demeanor changes and he remains silent. He shifts in his seat.>

 

DUVALL:

 Yeah?

MAN:

 Your colleague is watching me right now.

DUVALL:

 You born that way?

MAN:

 Got exposed to a 

parasite

 during an operation in Germany. My abilities have proven quite useful.

DUVALL:

 I thought the Coalition didn‚Äôt like anomalies.

MAN:

 Maybe, Mr. Duvall, we are not the mindless killers certain people paint us out to be.

 

<Silence.>

 

MAN:

 Well, Mr. Duvall, and whoever else is watching, let‚Äôs not stray too far from the topic at hand. We both know why this meeting was called, after all.

DUVALL:

 Did you kill her? Tori Fr√†nk?

MAN:

 No.

DUVALL:

 And I‚Äôm supposed to believe that?

MAN:

 Quite frankly, there is no way for you to know the truth, other than what I have to say.

DUVALL:

 That‚Äôd be putting a lot of trust into a person I barely know.

MAN:

 If I may, Mr. Duvall‚Äî

DUVALL:

 You may.

MAN:

 ‚ÄîI was under the impression that this meeting was to determine whether the Coalition had a hand in the event or not. And I have quickly and truthfully answered your questions. Now, if you‚Äôd excuse me.

 

<The man stands up from his seat, taking the briefcase with him. The chair makes a scraping noise as he stands up.>

 

DUVALL:

 No‚Ä¶ wait!

 

<The man walks past Agent Duvall. He grabs the man by the wrist. He looks down at Duvall.>

 

DUVALL:

 Please‚Ä¶ I, I have a son.

 

<The man‚Äôs expression changes. Duvall loosens his grip.>

 

MIMKO:

 Duvall‚Ä¶

DUVALL:

 His name is Michal. He‚Äôs nine years old. I have tried my best giving that boy the normalest of lives possible. To make him know that he is 

not

 different from anybody else.

 

<The man moves back to his seat and sits down. He listens intently at Duvall.>

 

DUVALL:

 Last week, UIU agents showed up at my front door. Practically barged right in there‚Ä¶ and two days ago, my wife watched as someone followed her from her workplace all the way home; today was the same. If they‚Äôre willing to do that, what would these people do to my son?

DUVALL:

 The day the agent came, Michal was scared shitless. He couldn‚Äôt move, he couldn‚Äôt‚Äî And I don‚Äôt want that to happen again. I want them to leave my son alone. Fuck me, I don‚Äôt want my son growing up feeling that he‚Äôs different, just because his daddy works at a shadow organization. I‚Ä¶

 

<Silence.>

<The man sighs. He puts the briefcase on the desk and clasps it open. Inside is a flashdrive in velvet cushioning. He retrieves the flashdrive and offers it to Duvall, who hesitantly takes it.>

 

MAN:

 That drive contains footage of the path the assailant took after the assassination, captured by CCTV in the area. My people are already on it, but a few more cooks in the kitchen never hurt anybody.

 

<Agent Duvall is left speechless. The man clasps his briefcase shut again and gets up to leave.>

 

MAN:

 I may have not been totally honest, Mr. Duvall. I hope you forgive me.

 

<Duvall is still speechless. The man nods at him and exits the area.>

<After some time, Agent Duvall‚Äôs earpiece cackles to life again.>

 

MIMKO:

 Duvall, you reading me?

DUVALL:

 ‚Ä¶ yes. Yes. 

(clears throat)

 I read you, Dr. Mimko.

MIMKO:

 The mission‚Äôs done. Good job, Henrik.

 

<Agent Duvall looks out the window. He spots the black van from earlier, which is observed to exit the empty parking lot, pass by the window, before passing out of view.>

 

[END RECORDING]

NOTES:

 I analyzed the footage contained on the flashdrive. The entity retreated into a dilapitated apartment building after the incident, several streets down. Investigated the area, armed; SCP-8870 was not present at the scene and there were signs it had fled the area beforehand.

However, I was able to gather several items of interest, which are detailed below:

Detailed files on Karl Uzbekki;

Detailed files on Tori Fr√†nk;

Schedules of news anchor CNN;

Detailed files on Dr. Abu Ugondo;

Broken mobile phone.

Set up various recording equipment in every nook and cranny of the apartment. The entity hasn‚Äôt shown up since the incident. -

<It is late in the night. Various paper documents and tech litter the conference table. Cavollo, Duvall, Mimko and Schneider are all present.>

 

CAVOLLO:

 Sending Mr. Fish into that talkshow? Brilliant! What an ingenius idea!

SCHNEIDER:

 Don‚Äôt congratulate me too much. Parawatch is so much up my asshole, I can‚Äôt even feel it anymore.

 

<The both of them snicker.>

<Dr. Mimko stands up and holds up a glass to clink it. Everyone quiets down and turns to look at her.>

 

MIMKO:

 Please. The meeting is starting. After our latest operation, Agent Duvall found the residence of SCP-8870. No traces of the anomaly. Apparently it left in a hurry. 

(gestures to Duvall)

 Duvall, if you may.

DUVALL:

 We found some things in the apartment.

 

<Duvall puts stacks of paper onto the table among the other stacks of papers.>

 

DUVALL:

 One of those things were detailed files on Dr. Abu Ugondo, who, if you‚Äôve just tuned in with the news a little bit, is supposed to conduct an interview with CNN in next week‚Äôs time.

CAVOLLO:

 So the entity‚Äôs gonna be there?

MIMKO:

 We don‚Äôt know, but it is likely.

 A trap, then? What, we station every corner with undercover agents and hope for the best?

MIMKO:

 Any better ideas?

SCHNEIDER:

<Dr. Mimko looks around the room. Her eyes settle on Agent Duvall, who returns the gesture, before looking back into the room. No one utters a word.>

 

MIMKO:

 Great. Meeting‚Äôs adjourned, then.

 

<Dr. Mimko sorts out files on the desk. Cavollo and Schneider pack their things and walk out of the room together. Agent Duvall remains on his seat, only standing up and walking to Dr. Mimko once the others have left.>

<He stops at Dr. Mimko.>

 

DUVALL:

 Why do you do all of this?

 

<Continues sorting files. Does not look up.>

 

MIMKO:

 I thought I‚Äôve made myself clear. If the world keeps on going down that path, it‚Äôs gonna get run over.

 No, not that. I mean,

 No.

MIMKO:

 Why would you? She died in some classified operation with a dangerous SCP.

 I‚Äôve seen how dangerous anomalies can be. The same anomalies the Foundation keeps under lock and key. I don‚Äôt want what happened to my sister happen to anybody else. 

This

INCIDENT 8870-Œ≤

DATE:

 02/17/2025

LOCATION:

 Atlanta, Georgia

FOREWORD:

 The following is the meeting of Dr. Abu Ugondo and news outlet CNN after Incident 8870-Œ±.

Due to the animosity against Foundation personnel, Dr. Hakari Mimko deemed it safer to assign a security escort to Dr. Abu Ugondo‚Äôs meeting. MTF Pi-1 was designated as the escort under Dr. Mimko‚Äôs orders.

Under Council ruling, Agent Duvall was authorized to carry a highly experimental weapon, in order to minimize potential casualties.

[BEGIN RECORDING]

 

<Interior is that of a medium-sized room, with an elevated stage in the front and a seating area for the audience. Two chairs and a desk are on the stage, with big screens behind them.>

<Several are in attendance, including MTF Pi-1 lead Agent Henrik Duvall, who sits in the back row. He carefully oversees the front rows.>

 

MIMKO:

 

(through earpiece)

 Anything suspicious yet?

DUVALL:

 Nope. Wouldn‚Äôt expect anything, ‚Äôtill the doc shows up.

 

<Duvall continues overseeing the area. He can be seen occasionally clutching his concealed weapon.>

<The lights in the room dim. Stage-lights turn on, pointing directly at the stage. Murmurs of the audience quiet down.>

 

DUVALL:

 Tell me again, why didn‚Äôt we cancel the event, if we suspect 8870 to be here?

MIMKO:

 This is our best chance capturing the entity. Or do you‚Äôve got a plan of their schedule?

DUVALL:

 Whatever you say, boss.

very

 special guest on our side. Whose very organization‚Äôs been under a lot of shade, as of late. I welcome to the stage, Mr. Abu Ugondo!

 

<Dr. Abu Ugondo enters from the left side of the stage. Although there is applause, it is noticeably less than before.>

<Both individuals sit down on their respective seat.>

 

REPORTER:

 Wow. It‚Äôs just so good to have you here, Mr. Ugondo.

UGONDO:

 Believe me, Ms. ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà. The pleasure‚Äôs all mine.

REPORTER:

 Well, Mr. Ugondo, I assume you‚Äôve heard about the recent controversy surrounding the Foundation‚Ä¶

UGONDO:

 I have, yes.

REPORTER:

 ‚Ä¶ And a lot of people still have mixed feelings about that. So why don‚Äôt I let you start? 

(gestures with hands)

UGONDO:

 Thank you very much. I‚Äôd like to start by saying that the SCP Foundation is, regardless of people‚Äôs opinions or views, a necessary organization. We contain thousands of anomalies, which could wipe out an entire country clean if not left in check. So I wanted to start by saying that.

UGONDO:

 Regarding the death of Tori Fr√†nk, the O5-Council is deeply sorry for her family, friends and colleagues. And of course what she meant to a lot of people ‚Äî 

people

 ‚Äî out there in the world. The Foundation does not take kindly to senseless violen‚Äî

DUVALL:

 Do I really gotta sit through this man saying empty platitudes?

MIMKO:

 Concentrate on the mission, Henrik.

DUVALL:

 

(sighs)

 Aye, aye.

UGONDO:

 ‚Äîlike to show that her death was not in vain, the Foundation has partnered up together with the Manna Charitable Foundation and Marshall, Carter & Dark to support oppressed anomalous communities in third world countries worldwide! This initiative aims a-

UGONDO:

 Yes?

REPORTER:

 ‚Äîyou‚Äôve partnered up with 

Marshall, Carter & Dark

, the same organization known to traffick human anomalies?

UGONDO:

 Well, it‚Äôs not that simple. What MC&D did in 2023 is inexcusable. But with their involvement with this initiative, they can help millions of people in the world.

REPORTER:

 And you ‚Äî 

the SCP Foundation

 ‚Äî genuinely think that this makes up for what happened?

UGONDO:

 We‚Äî

REPORTER:

 Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I think this initiative of yours is a cute attempt. But it doesn‚Äôt tackle the greatest problem: Anomalies around the world are still being oppressed. The Foundation is applying a band-aid to a gunshot wound; it‚Äôs simply ineffective.

UGONDO:

 The Foundation is trying its best‚Äî

 Oh, really? Millions of people‚Äôd say otherwise‚Äî

DUVALL:

 

Here we go.

 

<Conversation turns into a heated arguement between the reporter and Dr. Ugondo.>

<The audience grows louder, with the first murmurs amongst the crowd appearing. Several attendees begin to shout various expletives and making obscene gestures at Dr. Ugondo.>

<Agent Duvall keeps a vigilant eye at the proceedings.>

 

MIMKO:

 Anything now?

DUVALL:

 It‚Äôs like trying to find a needle in a haystack, only the haystack‚Äôs on fire and the needle microscopic.

MIMKO:

 So?

DUVALL:

 Nothing right now.

 

<The arguement comes to an end when members of MTF Pi-1 walk onto the stage and deter Dr. Ugondo away. The reporter and audience look on, as Dr. Ugondo is being slowly motioned away.>

<Before coming upon the exit, a figure in the middle rows stands up, maintaining intense eye contact with Dr. Ugondo.>

<Agent Duvall notices, pulls out his OKU-061 firearm,

 and utilizes it to incapacitate the figure.>

FOREWORD:

 The following is a recording of an interview with SCP-8870 after the events of Incident 8870-Œ≤.

[BEGIN RECORDING]

 

<Interview room‚Äôs interior are barren, featureless, stark white walls. There is a metal desk positioned in the center of the room, anchored to the floor, with plastic chairs on opposite ends of it.>

 

Photograph of SCP-8870, dated 19‚ñà‚ñà.

 

<SCP-8870 sits on one of those chairs, handcuffed to it. It is wearing a CLASS-III facial harness, which is obscuring its eyes. It shifts in its seat several times, appearing to be highly distressed.>

<Agent Duvall enters the interview room. At the sound of the door opening, SCP-8870 visibly tenses up. Duvall closes the door, observes the entity, and sits down opposite it.>

 

DUVALL:

 Well, well. If it isn‚Äôt the man himself. You‚Äôve put a lot of people in a lot of danger with your antics. But I suppose you already knew that.

 How about a name, hmm? You‚Äôre still being a slippery snake for our analysts to find.

 

<SCP-8870 remains silent, keeping its head down. It remains like this for an additional two minutes.>

<Duvall abruptly stands up, startling SCP-8870.>

 

DUVALL:

 How about this: You tell me all I wanna know, or else we start doing some 

real

 interrogation techniques. How does that sound for you?

 

<There is a twitch in SCP-8870‚Äôs facial expression. It shifts uncomfortably in its seat. It still remains silent, however.>

 

DUVALL:

 

(sighs)

 All right.

 

<Duvall approaches the exit door.>

 

8870:

 No, no, no!

 M‚Äîmy name‚Äôs Abdeen Howl‚Ä¶ please‚Ä¶ you gotta help me.

DUVALL:

 Help you how?

DUVALL:

 You want help or not?

8870:

 Y‚Äîyou don‚Äôt understand! You don‚Äôt!

DUVALL:

 Then make it so that I understand!

8870:

 Fuck i‚Äîit! Fuck it‚Ä¶ they‚Äôll only kill more people. They‚Äôre likely already dead‚Ä¶

 Who? Who‚Äôs dead?

<Silence. Agent Duvall‚Äôs expression is that of disbelief.>

 

8870:

 

(looks up at him)

 I got no powers, man. I‚Äôm just a man. Got nothing special. The only special thing I had was my family‚Ä¶

DUVALL:

 Do you have a name? Height, gender, age, anything?

8870:

 They just sent me messages. Pictures o‚Äîof my family, I‚Ä¶

8870:

 W‚Äîwait! What are you gonna do?!

 

<Agent Duvall does not respond. He opens the door and exits the room.>

 

[END RECORDING]

NOTES:

 Investigations into an ‚ÄôAbdeen Howl‚Äô revealed that he, and his family of four, had disappeared the night of 05/10/2024. Close acquaintances were questioned, but could not explain their sudden disappearance.

The true identity of SCP-8870 is still being identified.

<Duvall sits at the conference table amidst various miscellaneous objects. In one hand, he holds his mobile phone. In the other, he is holding a lit cigarette.>

<The door opens. Mimko enters, carrying various paper documents under her arm. She closes the door, only then noticing that her and Duvall are the only people present.>

 

MIMKO:

 Where are the other two?

DUVALL:

 I told them that the meeting was an hour later.

MIMKO:

 Why?

DUVALL:

 Because I‚Äôve been thinking‚Ä¶ about what happened to your sister.

MIMKO:

<A gunshot rings out. Where formerly his cigarette was, he is now holding a firearm. Mimko clutches her abdomen, blood trickling between her fingers, before collapsing onto the floor.>

<She tries to look at Duvall, who places a kick right into her chest. She clenches tightly, before Duvall puts his hand over her eyes and presses his leg down on her, pinning her down.>

<Mimko struggles, flailing her arms and legs around wildly.>

 

DUVALL:

 Stop resisting. 

Please!

 

<Mimko scratches Duvall‚Äôs hand. He winces.>

<Mimko is coughing up blood now. Low gurgles become audible, as she chokes on her own blood.>

<Duvall struggles to pin her down.>

 

DUVALL:

 Stop resisting! Stop 

fucking

 resisting!

 

<Mimko‚Äôs movements grow slower and more sluggish. After a while, barely any movement is detectable on Mimko‚Äôs part.>

<Just as she is about to become completely motionless, she stares onto a reflection of Agent Duvall on a nearby mirror.>

<Duvall‚Äôs attempts at restraining Mimko suddenly come to a halt, as he clutches his chest tightly. Mimko is able to push him off of herself, and retreats several meters away from him, slipping on her own blood.>

<She jolts herself back up. Her breaths are heavy and ragged, her eyes never leaving Duvall out of their sight.>

<Duvall clutches his chest tighter, before collapsing motionlessly to the floor. His eyes gaze right up into hers.>

 

MIMKO:

 

(cries)

 I‚Äôm sorry!

 

<She wipes away a flurry of tears from her eyes. Blood begins to pool around Duvall, originating from the chest. Soon the hydrochloric acid corrodes through his clothes and gear.>

 

MIMKO:

 

(gasps)

 I‚Äôm so sorry‚Ä¶

 

<Eventually, Duvall‚Äôs body goes limp. The acid melts him into a slurry of blood, gore and viscera, until nothing of him remains.>

<Mimko looks onto what remains. She sniffs, wipes away a tear, 

before growing near

 

motionless in this stance‚Ä¶

 

 

 

Your heart‚Äôs racing. It‚Äôs as if every sense of you was dialed up to their max and you plummeted down the Mt. Everest. Your limbs feel cold, the tips of your fingers and toes as if frostbitten.

The world fazes by in a blurry haze, every movement of yours sluggish. But your mind isn‚Äôt. It goes on, and on, and on. Endless spirales of thoughts and memories.

As if on instinct, your hand shoots up to the terminal‚Äôs console, and you type in commands as quickly and as quietly as you can.

The termimal cackles to life. 

Thank God,

 you think, exhaling loudly. A feminine voice comes through from the other end.

‚Äù

Clef

?‚Äù Sophia asks. 

Sophia Light

.

You part your lips, a slight wheeze escaping your mouth. You settle on something to say, something that summed up the situation in the most concise and least overwhelming way possible. It was just like mixing water with oil.

But you can‚Äôt. At first you don‚Äôt know why, but then you become aware of an awful, stinging feeling right in the middle of your chest. You clutch it tightly, gasping for air, as your knees painfully fail you.

‚ÄùClef, you there?‚Äù Sophia‚Äôs voice rings out yet again. She still received no answer.

That sting in your chest turns into a burning feeling. Droplets of red stain the floor, pooling around you in an almost mesmerizing, artistic pattern. Pieces of your clothes swim in the pool.

You aren‚Äôt a chemist, but no one needed expert-levels of expertise to know that acid was eating through your body. You gather all the strength you‚Äôve got left for one last time, do something, anything. Your head is above the meter tall terminal now.

And you collapse again. Your head impacts the console.

The last thing that you see on the flickering screen is the face of Dr. Hakari Mimko, completely silent and near motionless, who is looking up at the security camera, as if looking back at you. Staring straight into your soul.

And then it ends.
