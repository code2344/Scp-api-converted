SCP-6058

Item #:

 SCP-6058

Object Class:

 Safe

Special Containment Procedures:

 SCP-6058 is stored in a modified anomalous item locker at Site-07. Testing is forbidden.

Description:

 SCP-6058 is a mechanical device capable of producing live specimens of any lifeform, extinct or otherwise, when provided with a valid sample of said lifeform's DNA.

The rate at which SCP-6058 performs this function is variable, and believed to be dependent on the size of the organism in question. Once completed, SCP-6058 will expel its reproduction through a metal shaft at the base of the object. Further attempts to analyze the interior structure of SCP-6058 have resulted in failure.

78

Mammoth fossil

SCP-6058 appeared to strain for approximately eight hours, before producing what was later determined to be a deceased wooly mammoth calf. Cause of death ruled as asphyxiation.

79

Velociraptor fossil

SCP-6058 rejects the material and fails to function, with subsequent experiments delivering similar results. 

Further investigation pending.

See addendum.

Addendum:

 Over the course of Test 80, SCP-6058 strained for approximately 48 hours before dispensing a small piece of parchment from its ejection shaft and temporarily ceasing to function. The object read as follows:
