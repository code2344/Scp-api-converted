Item #: SCP-5410

Pending

Preliminary Containment Procedures

SCP-5410 is currently held within Critical Class Testing Chamber 7 at Site-51. Due to the limited information available on SCP-5410, full reality destabilization prevention protocols have been initiated. Site security personnel are to maintain Alert Condition Red until testing of SCP-5410 has been finalized and proper containment has been established.

Description

The control panel of SCP-5410.

SCP-5410 is a device of unknown origin with an internal Hume level of 1.91 to 2.05, oscillating in 30-second intervals. The outer material of SCP-5410 is composed of standard aluminum and steel. Located underneath its control panel is a small rectangular compartment, fitted with a thin sliding metal door. On the control panel itself there is a small steel placard labeled "WITCH".

The interior of SCP-5410 includes wires, calipers, pistons, and several electronic switchboards. A human brain attached to a large network of human nervous tissue is located behind the external control switchboard. It is theorized that these biological components catalyze the Hume alterations.

The exact purpose or function of SCP-5410 is currently unknown; initial testing will be initiated in 

Two

 hours.

 

Discovery

SCP-5410 at the time of discovery.

SCP-5410 was discovered on 

30 Jun 2025 00:37

 by a Foundation engineering team conducting a demolition survey on an unused section of Sublevel 6 at Site-52. The area where SCP-5410 was located in was originally listed as administrative offices when that sublevel was in use (1950-1958), but had been closed and the space reallocated as a long-term storage area for excess building materials.

Demolition engineers found a small sealed room that had not been previously listed on existing Site-52 blueprints. Once the area had been cleared and the room opened, SCP-5410 was located, along with two wooden chairs, a small circular wooden table, and an oval aluminum serving tray. The room itself had been decorated with faded floral wallpaper and several flower vases containing the remnants of long-dead floral arrangements.

Personnel are currently investigating Foundation records for information on SCP-5410 and the room it was located within.

Update:

 Testing Report

Critical Class Testing Chamber-7 has been retrofitted with four Mk-III Scranton Reality Anchors, collectively connected to the failsafe switch within the control room. SCP-5410 has been placed in the center of the testing area and fastened to the ground via hydraulic clamps.

The following is a video transcript of SCP-5410 Test-1:

 

Video Log

Depicted:

 Dr. William Reynolds, Junior Researcher Michael Sutton, D-04418

Foreword:

 Dr. Reynolds and JR Sutton will be observing the test in the control room of Chamber-7. D-04418 will activate SCP-5410 via the activation dial located on the control panel.

[BEGIN LOG]

[D-04418 is standing a meter away from SCP-5410.]

Dr. Reynolds:

 D-04418, are you ready to begin?

D-04418:

 Uh, yeah, I just gotta turn this thing on right– no weird shit this time?

Dr. Reynolds:

 That's correct, we'd like you to turn the dial to "activate" and then step away from the device.

[D-04418 approaches SCP-5410.]

D-04418:

 Yeah, okay. Like this?

[D-04418 turns the dial to activate; after several seconds, SCP-5410 begins to vibrate.]

Dr. Reynolds:

 Please step away from the device, D-04418.

D-04418:

 Shit, you right.

[SCP-5410 emits a loud metallic screeching for approximately 35 seconds, D-04418 winces in response.]

D-04418:

 Uh, hey Dr. Reynolds, is that supposed to sound like that?

JR Sutton:

 The local Hume field is fluctuating rapidly between 1.2 and 1.4.

[A bright light emanates from the lower compartment of SCP-5410.]

JR Sutton:

 These readings indicate it's attempting to manifest someth– The Hume field just spiked to 2.3.

Dr. Reynolds:

 It's establishing relative permanence.

[The light coming from SCP-5410 is getting brighter, D-04418 takes several steps back.]

D-04418:

 Yeah it's, uh, definitely glowing now.

[The light ceases instantly and the activation dial switches back into the standby position.]

D-04418:

 Oh, I-I think it's over guys.

Dr. Reynolds:

 D-04418, please open the lower compartment located below the control board.

D-04418:

 Shit, I knew it wasn't over.

Dr. Reynolds:

 Please take the camera with you, and D-04418, be cautious opening the door– we have no idea what's inside of the machine.

D-04418:

 Yeah, okay.

[D-04418 picks the camera up as he approaches SCP-5410. After hesitating for a moment, D-04418 reaches down and opens the compartment.]

D-04418:

 Huh, that's it?

Designated SCP-5410-1, the cup of tea manifested by SCP-5410 was immediately sent for analysis. Subsequent testing of SCP-5410 resulted in identical instances of SCP-5410-1.

Analysis of the SCP-5410-1 instances revealed no anomalous properties, aside from their creation. SCP-5410-1 instances are prepared to the exact specification of ISO 3103, the international standard for a cup of tea with milk.

 The measurement of each ingredient is accurate down to the nanogram. The underside of each porcelain container is labeled "Property of the SCP Foundation".

Records from 1953 include an acquisition invoice, signed by Dr. Elijah Wilson

, for a "Wilson's International Tea Creator-H". This item is currently theorized to be SCP-5410, though no further information regarding the item has been found. Further investigation into the origin of SCP-5410 is currently ongoing.

Footnotes
