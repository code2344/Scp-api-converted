Item #:

 SCP-7037

Object Class:

 Safe

Special Containment Procedures:

 SCP-7037 is to be contained in a thaumaturgically augmented storage locker located in the Storage Wing of Site-37; unless otherwise approved by at least one member of the O5 Council, this locker is to be disconnected from baseline reality at all times to minimize its influence of probabilistic reality.

1

Description:

 SCP-7037 is a forty-seven leaf clover that has a constant effect on relative probabilistic reality, resulting in the perceivable existence of good fortune.

2

 As such effects have been observed as far as 50 km away from the source, an exact sphere of influence is unknown, though it is reasonably assumed to be no further than 100 km.

Addendum-1:

 Discovery

SCP-7037 was discovered in the home of Reuben Walsh, located within a small village in rural Ireland. The anomaly was initial brought to Foundation attention after Evelyn O'Shannon made a social media post detailing that her mother had miraculously recovered from Stage 4 lung cancer despite being completely bedridden and comatose a day prior. Two members of MTF Pulse-17 ("Your Everyday Citizens") were dispatched to the location under the guise of tourists and, through conversation with locals, discovered multiple other instances of unlikely, probabilistic outcomes, including, but not limited to,

3

 the following:

Three separate marriages occurring on the same day, at the same church, with all three couples sharing the same surname "Ortiz."

A seven year old boy falling out of a tree from an approximate elevation of 25 meters; he sustained no injuries despite the likelihood of simply surviving a fall being less than a 10% chance.

During a storm, lightning striking an elderly woman 7 times

4

; similar to the boy, she sustained no injuries.

After Doctor Celzin determined these instances, along with others not listed, to be astronomically unlikely to occur within baseline probabilistic reality, additional MTF Pulse-17 members with thaumaturgic abilities were dispatched and, using their abilities, were to enter and investigate citizen homes through use of thaumaturgical persuasion. During this search, SCP-7037 was recovered from the home of Reuben Walsh who, through specified mnestic treatment, was implanted with false memories of the clover wilting.

Addendum-2:

 Testing Excerpts

Multiple tests were approved by Doctor Celzin to ascertain specifications and limits of SCP-7037's anomalous properties. While testing was extensive,

5

 only important excerpts have been included for documental efficiency.

File.Test_Log-7037_07.scptxt

Experiment:

 D-19732 is isolated in a room with SCP-7037

6

 which is disconnected from baseline probabilistic reality via thaumaturgic seals. Within the room is a table, chair, and six decks of cards. D-19732 is prompted to shuffle each deck as much as they wish, but not to check the faces of any cards.

Result:

 Inspection of the cards revealed that, despite varying methods and time taken to shuffle each deck, all six held the exact order of cards. As each shuffle is a 1 in 52!

7

 chance, the statistical probability of such an occurrence is 1 in 52!

6

, or 1 in 2.75 x 10

407

 chance.

Additional Notes:

 This is a statistical impossibility. Truly. If we go off the calculation that there are 10

82

 atoms in our observable universe, you could turn every atom into its own universe, every atom of those universes into its own, and repeat twice more, pick a random atom, and that's just 10

410

. That's only a thousand times less likely than this shuffle. We are dealing with an anomaly that makes the impossible possible, and we 

need

 to be careful. — Senior Researcher Asher Celzin.

Following Test Log 7037-07, the following five tests replicated the same experiment with seven, eight, ten, twenty, and fifty decks respectively. All resulted in the same outcome; all decks held the same shuffle. After the conclusion of Test Log 7037-12,

 Doctor Celzin submitted the following proposal to update containment procedures to the Site Director.

 Requesting revision of SCP-7037's containment procedures.

Attached are multiple files pertaining to SCP-7037, all of which reflect the urgency with which I send this email. The outcomes of all tests suggest this anomaly controls probability at an unfathomable scale, yet current containment procedures do not reflect this state; a disconnect from our baseline does not ensure total freedom of its influence. But I believe it may be possible to contain even said influence so long as you grant me access to a team comprised of on-site thaumaturges. I believe this anomaly is far more complex than it was initially thought to be.

Please reach out soon, Asher.

 RE:Requesting revision of SCP-7037's containment procedures.

Asher. I have reviewed the files attached and have considered your proposal, but I see no necessity for such concerns. Furthermore, as Site-37 is a fledgling site we cannot allocate expenses towards fields that would serve to waste them. Fretting over a clover is no way to spend your time, Doctor. Please come to your senses.

Officially, your proposal to revise procedures is denied.

- Close File

Following the denial of Doctor Celzin's proposal, experimentation continued as it had initially.

File.Test_Log-7037_32.scptxt

Experiment:

 D-19732 is once again isolated in a room with SCP-7037 that is disconnected from baseline, probabilistic reality. Within the room is a table, chair, and a singular coin, alongside a set of instructions to flip the coin one-hundred times and record results.

Results:

 Despite no column being listed, D-19732 wrote in once denoted "edge" and marked said column 100 times. Following questioning alongside analysis of video footage, said results were confirmed. Research into baseline probability of this result, along with a use of a SPP,

9

 calculated the baseline probability to be a 1 in 6000 chance, whereas the results of testing suggest replicating such a result is 1 in 1.53 x 10

378

, a result similarly miniscule to that of the Test Log 7037-07.

Additional Notes:

 Despite multiple other intended tests, I think we perfectly understand what this anomaly is capable of. It doesn't just skew chance; it plays with it. Thirty-two tests disprove any coincidence, and further tests will deny any of even the most skeptic among us, but in the meantime I 

highly

 suggest increasing security clearance regarding SCP-7037. I fear what may happen if it falls into the wrong hands. — Senior Researcher Asher Celzin

Similarly to tests following Test Log 7037-07, the following three tests after Test Log 7037-32 replicated the same experiment with two-hundred, five-hundred, and one-thousand coin flips respectively, all yielding the same results; all coins landed on their edge, every single time. Additionally, different coins were used throughout to nullify any suspicion that the coin itself may have been anomalous. At this time, Doctor Celzin also submitted another proposal to the Site Director, as can be seen below.

Subject:

 Urgent request to revise SCP-7037's containment procedures.

Director, I understand why you dismissed the initial proposal and am not here to argue your previous determinations, however further experimentation has yielded increasingly concerning results. The results with the deck were probabilistically impossible, yet there is no "wrong" yield to a deck; most people will 

never

 see a coin land on its edge in their entire lifetime. Let alone hundreds of times in one sitting. Outcomes one never naturally takes into account are regularly occurring to an extent that warrants extreme scrutiny. At this point, what stops it from somehow causing its own containment structure to fail? Each test only deepens my worries.

Regardless, I am strongly recommending containment procedures be heavily updated. Again, with your approval, I can execute most of the changes myself so long as even one thaumaturge be provided. I am aware of our expense disparity, but the threat this anomaly may impose cannot be reasonably ignored. Surely even you must see that now. Files are attached below as before.

Please think it over, Asher.

 RE:Urgent request to revise SCP-7037's containment procedures.

This "threat" you speak of is a non-emergency, Asher. I have looked over the files, even those attached the first time I addressed these concerns, and my stance has not wavered. There is no threat, or danger, or whatever you want to call it. And there is no chance the current seals upon it fail; unlike a coin landing on its edge, the probability of all seals suddenly failing is effectively zero. I cannot reasonably justify allocating funds over something as trivial as this.

I had faith in you when I raised you to Senior Researcher. I deeply hope that faith was not misplaced. I'm placing you on a brief suspension to clear your head. Hopefully you'll stop wasting my time over this SCP when you return.

Following completion of her suspension, Doctor Celzin filed a secondary request to take over as the lead participant, alongside her current responsibilities as head researcher, of SCP-7037. This motion, unlike the prior, was approved due to presumed non-threat of the anomaly. The following tests were conducted under such conditions.

File.Test_Log-7037_77.scptxt

Experiment:

 Senior Research Asher Celzin is isolated in a room with SCP-7037 and is disconnected from baseline probabilistic reality. Within the room is a table, chair, and three lottery tickets.

10

 The tickets were within SCP-7037's sphere of influence. Doctor Celzin proceeds to scratch each off and compare them to their respective, winning numbers.

Results:

 All three tickets win their respective jackpots, summing up to an approximate total of $777 million. As a result, the Ethics Committee conducted a brief investigation into the manner of SCP-7037 testing and ultimately determined that, despite the influence of SCP-7037, Doctor Celzin had a right to the money, though was strictly discouraged from replication of similar testing.

Additional Notes:

 I have no use for the money; I want to get that off my chest first and foremost. I split it amongst various charities, put a 

lot

 into the Foundation, and even sent some home to my folks, but I kept none of it. This was an example, a 

perfect

 one, of just how powerful this anomaly is. And how dangerous it is. And I will continue testing until someone above me finally believes me.

Senior Researcher Asher Celzin filed a proposal with the previous file attached in a third email correspondence with Site-37's Director. Unlike previous messages however, Doctor Celzin's went unanswered for four days. Documents of the exchange are below.

Subject:

 DO NOT IGNORE - URGENT REVISION PROPOSAL

This anomaly is far beyond our initial comprehension, Zerwick, and your ignorance will not provide you bliss.

You deny my first proposal. Fine, I get it. You deny my second. Frustrating, but I could gather more data. You even suspend me, then deny my request to be informed on why such a decision was determined. A request which, according to 

all

 site procedures, must be granted upon request. But I held my tongue. I let you shove me aside because the anomaly was more important than bickering with you. Consider this my third proposal.

Attached are documents I'm sure you won't bother to truly read, but they detail just how much this anomaly twists probabilistic reality. SCP-7037 has been shown to affect reality relative to its influence as much as its own; the tickets I bought weren't within its influence, yet their numbers showed up nonetheless. This is bigger than us, Zerwick. Bigger than the few bucks it would take to provide me with what 

little

 tools I need to faithfully contain this anomaly. So I ask, no, 

beg

 you to approve a full-scale revision of the clover's containment procedures. It is a vital necessity.

With regards, Doctor Celzin.

 RE:DO NOT IGNORE - URGENT REVISION PROPOSAL

I told you to let this go, Asher. I had faith a break would provide you with a clear enough headspace to realize what a fool you've made yourself out to be. Clearly I was mistaken. SCP-7037 is safely contained within its box; nothing will change that, no matter how much you worry your pretty little head over it. Now, not only are you asking me to waste resources on this stupid paranoia of yours, but you're also 

consistently

 wasting my time.

Consider this your final warning. Remember who it was that raised you to the position you sit so comfortably within and remember it well. I grow tired of this bullshit you keep laying at my feet and will hear of it no longer. If you're really 

that

 concerned about the damn clover, direct your complaints to Watson. I won't acknowledge them any longer.

Following her correspondence with the Director, Doctor Celzin submitted multiple proposals to Assistant Director Sherwood Watson's email. All went unacknowledged. Despite such, Doctor Celzin reportedly continued researching the effects of SCP-7037.

 Incident-7037-01

File.Incident-7037_01.scpmp4

DATE:

 7/07/20██

FOREWORD:

 Incident-7037-01 occurred approximately twenty-seven minutes after the arrival of O5-1 to Site-37 for a meeting with its Site Director. The perpetuator of this incident has been identified to be SCP-7037's head researcher Asher Celzin. The following is a concise summary of the incident:

[0000]:

 

Doctor Celzin can be see in an experimentation cell, presumably conducting a test related to SCP-7037.

[0003]:

 

O5-1 arrives at Site-37 alongside one member

11

 of MTF Alpha-1 ("Red Right Hand") as a an escort.

[0004]:

 

Site-37's Director notifies all staff of Class 4 clearance of the O5's arrival as per standard procedure.

[0005]:

 

Celzin acknowledges the notice and appears to grow increasingly troubled over the course of the following five or six minutes.

[0011]:

 

After confirming O5-1's identity, the Site Director leads the O5 to his personal office.

[0017]:

 

Despite appearing visibly conflicted, Celzin continues and completes their experimentation with SCP-7037 and is seen noting the results.

[0023]:

 

The Site Director can be seen leading O5-1 throughout Site-37 as per the O5's own request.

[0025]:

 

Celzin completes notation of results and appears to gather up equipment; a few minutes later she is seen to be heading towards the site's Storage Wing, presumably to return SCP-7037 to its containment locker.

[0031]:

 

An unexpected breach occurs regarding a non-hostile humanoid anomaly; due to this, O5-1 sends their own MTF guard to aid in re-containment. The Director and O5 continue towards the Storage Wing due to the lack of danger affiliated with the breach.

[0033]:

 

Celzin enters the Storage wing and is seen moving towards SCP-7037's storage locker; once they notice the Site Director and O5-1, however, they freeze in place.

[0034]:

 

When O5-1 is approximately one meter away from Celzin, she suddenly arms herself with her personal sidearm, leveling the gun at the Overseer's head. The following dialogue is exchanged:

Director:

 Asher! What the fuck are you doing? Put the gun down.

O5-1:

 Lass, I'm not sure what you're trying to pull, but I'm not sure you know who-

[0035]:

 

Celzin pulls the trigger, but the gun jams. She sighs in visible relief and drops the firearm.

Celzin:

 …I was right.

[END LOG]

Following the events of Incident-7037-01, Asher Celzin was immediately detained, questioned, and put through psychological analysis testing due to the sudden, irregular behavior. Such tests reveal that she was not only of a perfectly sane and unaltered state of mind, but that her actions were executed with the intent of O5-1's survival; the following is her own testimony given at the end of her evaluation:

"Denial after denial after 

denial.

 I couldn't take it anymore, all of the… inaction. I've spoken with Velrium before — hell, I considered him a friend! — but he wouldn't do anything. Nothing serious, at least. Just a quick 'denied' and he went on with his day. So when I heard an O5 was in the building, I… I got the terrible idea to put a gun to their head. I wasn't going to act on it at first, I swear, but when we crossed paths it was like the clover had brought him right to me. And as luck would have it, the gun jammed, just as I expected. Fuck- I probably wrote my own death sentence, but at least they'll be forced to pay the damn anomaly some mind." - Senior Researcher Asher Celzin

Celzin's reprimanding is pending 

Site Director Velrium Zerwick's

 O5-1's discretion.

Subject:

 SUSPENSION NOTICE

After tonight's incident, I have taken upon it upon myself to look into the operations of Site-37. What I have found has left me rather disgusted at the scale of negligence perpetuated within, particularly by yourself, Zerwick. SCP-7037's files display over a dozen proposals to update containment procedures, yet all were discarded and discredited without much thought. From what I can see in your own logged data, a team of researchers weren't even dispersed to further review the SCP which is, as you 

very

 well know, standard procedure.

If you have a "justification" for this egregious ignorance, I do not wish to hear it. The amount of offenses I could attribute to you from less than a day of reading is grounds for termination alone; purposeful ignorance, refusal to follow procedure, discounting of documentation, etc. Consider yourself lucky that you are receiving a direct message instead of a removal notice. Going forward, however, you will be placed on indefinite suspension until further notice. Do not fret; the site will be left in quite capable hands. A new Director's hands, specifically.

Doctor Celzin will be taking your place as Site Director. This is inarguable. Did you see the look in her eyes as she leveled that gun at me? The burning flames of determination within? It was not hatred that drove her to pull the trigger, but desperation. Asher is a remarkably intelligent woman, and after looking into her files, alongside SCP-7037's, I am thoroughly convinced it was your own inaction that drove her to this extreme. I can only applaud her bravery and commitment to the Foundation; it is clear where her loyalties lie. And where your own fall short.

I will be in contact with Celzin shortly. I want you to spend a lot of time thinking during your leave.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In accordance to O5-1's declarations, Velrium Zerwick was placed on immediate suspended leave. Despite her promotion, Asher Celzin was also placed on a brief suspension period of two months per the request of multiple other Overseers despite O5-1's protests. As such, Doctor Celzin is currently serving her suspension period of two months, following which she will assume role of Site Director at Site-37. During this period, Sherwood Watson is to temporarily assume this role.

Additionally, SCP-7037 was taken into Overseer custody following this incident with the intent of further testing. O5-6 has assumed role as the primary researcher for said anomaly.

Addendum-3:

 O5 Council Census Regarding SCP-7037

File.O5_Census-7037_01.scpmp4

Date:

 7/09/20██

Foreword:

 Following the events of Incident-7037-1, O5-1 called a non-emergency meeting of the Council to discuss further procedure regarding SCP-7037 itself. Due to other vital proceedings, however, multiple Overseers were unable to attend; as the subject matter was not considered of the utmost necessity, the meeting proceeded despite the absence of O5-3, O5-8, O5-10, and O5-12.

<O5-4 enters Overseer Hall and takes her seat, effectively being the last to arrive of the nine present members. As she sits, O5-1 activates thaumaturgical wards on the hall, rendering it a reality exclusion zone as is standard procedure.>

O5-1:

 All are present? 

<A unanimous round of confirmation is heard from the other eight.>

 Perfect. You have all read the briefing, I'm sure.

O5-9:

 I read the briefing alright. Someone tried to take your life, One. And you 

rewarded

 her for it?

O5-2:

 Did you read the full file? It seems it was quite expectant that she would fail. She even drafted a hypothesis on it.

O5-9:

 And if she didn't? I feel as though the situation is being regarded far too lightly for an attempt on a council member's life.

O5-13:

 The way I see it, it's One's life, not ours. If he believes she is to be acquitted, then she is acquitted. It is no skin off my back.

O5-11:

 Regardless of our own beliefs regarding this Doctor Celzin, we are not here to discuss such semantics. One?

O5-1:

 Thank you. I appreciate your concerns, but the matter at hand here is SCP-7037, not worries regarding myself. Six and I have taken it upon ourselves to conduct our own research into the anomaly, and the result are… interesting, to say the least. Six, if you could?

<O5-6 produces multiple copies of a printed file and distributes it to everyone present. File is included below.>

O5-1:

 Please take a moment to read through it. All of you.

File.O5-Test_Log-7037-Summary.scptxt

SCP-7037 is an anomaly capable of modifying any and all probabilities to an extent such that it would not be unwise to consider it a passive reality bender. What is of curious note, however, is the extent to which it seems related to the human psyche. For instance, in an attempt to replicate Doctor Celzin's six-deck test, we substituted the human participant with an AI; the results were eye-opening, as no deck shared a shuffle. Once the human component was reintroduced, however, the results returned to statistical impossibilities.

Of extreme note, however, are its capabilities to protect said human component, though this seems to come at a cost. With approval of the Ethics Committee, we conducted several tests which should have harmed the participating personnel, yet in all instances excluding those which would cause minor injuries

12

 a failure always occurred which negated the administration of such harm. Whether this is an intentional trait of the anomaly or simply its passive effect on probability on a grander scale is unknown.

What is known, however, is that situations in which its modification of probability saves lives results in the wilting of exactly one clover leaf. This was true for both Incident-7037-1 and one of our own tests replicating the same scenario. As such, SCP-7037 may prove to be an invaluable tool, but a finite resource nonetheless.

<Over the course of approximately five minutes all Overseers read through the file.>

O5-4:

 So what does this make SCP-7037? Some sort of anomalously good omen?

O5-9:

 Or some sort of trick. Who's to say the anomaly won't suddenly decide to skew chance against us?

O5-2:

 The original files, which heavily outline SCP-7037's lack of a consciousness.

O5-9:

 And if that's a trick, too? We've seen smart anomalies before; it is dangerous to trust one even for a moment. Remember the Falling Dawn Incident?

<O5-6 visibly shudders; O5-5 and O5-11 appear uncomfortable.>

O5-13:

 We 

all

 remember that incident, but I think we should also be keen to acknowledge anomalies which have done us good. O5-8 is still kicking because of the damn pill, and O5-3 is more spectral than they are human.

O5-9:

 That doesn't change that fact that SCP-7037 might be dangerous-

O5-7:

 I'd argue your continued skepticism is just as dangerous. There is very little point to it over such a relatively trivial matter.

O5-9:

 Trivial!? We're all reading the same document here, aren't we? It toys with probability like a toddler with Lego; chaotically! How is this trivial?

O5-7:

 If you would stop shouting I'm sure others would love to explain. This is a council meeting; try to control yourself.

<O5-9 glares at O5-7 but ultimately remains silent.>

O5-7:

 Thank you. Now, if anyone would like to refute? Civil-like, mind you.

<Silence permeates the room for a few moments. Eventually, O5-11 speaks.>

O5-11:

 I may be a bit biased, but I see very little detriment in utilizing SCP-7037 as a tool which may benefit the Foundation's functions. We already have anecdotal proof that it has prevented an Overseer's death.

O5-2:

 I agree. That is quite undeniable. In fact, through all of Doctor Celzin's, One's, and Six's research there has not been one instance which suggests the effects of this anomaly are negative.

O5-13:

 They suggest quite the opposite, actually. With nearly two-hundred recorded tests, it seems statistically improbable a negative outcome would occur.

O5-9:

 

Statistically

 improbable. Are you 

hearing

 yourself? This anomaly takes probability and twists it into whatever the hell it wants! Statistical probabilities don't exist when speaking of this anomaly. The tests prove that just as much as anything else.

O5-6:

 Will you not listen to reason?

O5-4:

 As much as I hate to agree with Nine, they bring up valid concerns, though I also believe their paranoia steers them more-so than their mind.

O5-9:

 …thank you?

O5-4:

 Regardless, I think we should take into consideration his points as much so as our own.

O5-5:

 Back and forth, back and forth…

O5-1:

 

<Sighs.>

 Very well. Perhaps you misunderstand our intentions for the anomaly.

O5-9:

 And what are your intentions exactly?

O5-1:

 I wish to install SCP-7037 into the Overseer Hall directly and-

O5-9:

 Not a shot in hell.

O5-6:

 Nine, let's not-

O5-9:

 Don't 

"Nine"

 me. The Overseer Hall? Are you stupid? Do you-

O5-7:

 Nine.

O5-9:

 -really think-

O5-7:

 

Nine.

O5-9:

 -that I'll just sit here and-

<O5-7 slams his fist into the table.>

O5-7:

 Nine! 

<The room falls silent.>

 You're acting like a child. Calm down, and remember your station.

<Nine appears visibly offended but falls silent, lowering his head.>

O5-7:

 Clearly this meeting is going no where. One, mind moving on to the official proposal.

O5-1:

 Yes. Of course. 

<O5-1 clears their throat.>

 This is O5 proposal 7037-1; I, head of the O5 Council, hereby propose SCP-7037 be installed with the Overseer Hall with the express intent of utilization as a Foundation failsafe. All in favor?

WELCOME, OVERSEER

Incident 7037-2:

 On 11/05/20██, Site-01 experienced a major-scale attack of simultaneous GoIs, most of which employed the use of multiple deadly anomalies and anomalous technology. This attack was heavily coordinated and explicitly occurred whilst all O5 Council members were on-site for an urgent meeting, and nearly resulted in the deaths of multiple Overseers during the attack.

However, during the attack SCP-7037's containment cell, despite being thaumaturgically disconnected from baseline, probabilistic reality, failed and reconnected to baseline, the anomaly immediately taking large-scale effect over the facility and, following SPMs

 produced by O5-13, was credited with preventing the death of anywhere between three to seven members of the Council, along with the capture of multiple hostile agents.

Following this incident, Doctor Celzin contacted O5-1 with a request to aid in investigation efforts. As she had already served three weeks of her suspension, alongside further testing emphasizing both her concerns and beliefs regarding SCP-7037, she was allowed to return to work and promptly assume position as Site-37's Director. The following is an email correspondence between herself and O5-1 throughout the course of their investigation.

 Investigation findings regarding SCP-7037.

Hello, sir. Firstly, thank you for allowing me to return so soon. I appreciate everything you have done for me so far.

Regarding Incident 7037-2, I conducted multiple interrogations of the three agents that had been captured and discovered multiple through-lines. Firstly, despite wearing uniforms traced to the Global Occult Coalition, the Church of the Broken God, and the Bloodless Martyrs, all three "willingly" identified themselves with the Chaos Insurgency. Following acquisition of personal information, we found these claims to be true.

Their weapons, however, are a different matter. Most were anomalously modified and reflected those we've previously acquired from Prometheus, though they show further signs of modification. We've since traced such to MC&D's markets, however the prices suggest these were supposedly resold for far surpasses traditional expenditures of the Chaos Insurgency. Perhaps you can provide some insight where they may have received the funding? I have attached relevant files.

No need for such formalities, "One" will do just fine. The Council isn't quite as strict on professionalism as you might think. And you are welcome.

Regarding the documents you've provided, I had my personal team look further into MC&D's involvement regarding the Prometheus weaponry, alongside divulgement of funds within the Chaos Insurgency itself. Curiously, our implanted double-agents within the organization have no records of such spending, and rather described a sense of confusion throughout the general ranks; supposedly, no such attack on the Foundation was to occur.

My running theory is that of a splinter group. Perhaps those captured can provide a more specified insight?

 RE:RE:Investigation findings regarding SCP-7037.

Alright then, One. I might have a lead.

Two of the hostile agents were practically useless, effectively peon-soldiers utilized for combat and not much else. The third, however, was the team's acting commander who, after some persuasion, was very willing to tell us everything he willingly could (I suspect various geas' made certain information unspeakable). A lot of it was typical Insurgency bull, as I'm sure you and your associates have known all too well, but a couple pieces stuck out to me.

The group is a splinter as you suspected, but they're even more than that. All of the personnel, though identifying with the CI, are all listed as "deserters" and have been considered irretrievably lost. They've since been acting as some sort of rogue guns-for-hire, and their claim is this attack was a prime example; someone outside of the Insurgency paid them to do this.

I have since offered the commander a freedom agreement should they somehow provide us with access to their Insurgency's accounts. At this point we're simply following the money trail.

Following Director Celzin's second email and additional interrogation of the CI splinter group, she gained access to multiple documents via account access provided by the group's commander. Such documents included financial data, which provided no names but confirmed that the funder was a private investor, and location data, which Celzin then presented to O5-1 with a prompt request to breach the location.

Reconnaissance provided by MTF Lucid-13 ("All Eyes") quickly confirmed safety to breach, at which point temporary MTF Vex-09 ("Trail Chasers") was quickly assembled, consisting of traditional MTF agents alongside two combat-practiced thaumaturges. On 9/18/20██, Vex-09 would be deployed to Hostile-7037, where they would breach without incident, subduing all hostile agents and securing the facility. Multiple files were obtained at said site and immediately provided to Director Celzin, who would later submit them to O5-1, alongside the following note:

Turns out the investor is an old friend of mine.

I had always found Site-37's so-called "budget concerns" a statistical anomaly of its own. Of course, it may have been a problem in the past, but now the Foundation is thriving, and new Sites are constructed with a large enough allowance that it could be built three times over without little financial damage. Seems these suspicions were correct; the lack of funds originated from a man-made sinkhole, all poured into a group hell-bent on destroying us.

I am not surprised to find Velrium Zerwick's signature on some of these documents, though I can't say I'm excited. Of all of the agents secured at Hostile-7037, not a single one had knowledge of his whereabouts; I can only suspect he ran when he could. It would certainly suit the self-serving slug. I can only hope he rots in those shadows, but that's wishful thinking. More than one of these documents blames me for his impromptu removal, and I fear he will not let me live that one down.

Until then, however, we continue onward. Attached is my final proposal to revise SCP-7037's containment procedures, along with built-in precautions to protect you Overseers. With all of the evidence we have, I have no doubt it will pass.

 - Site-37 Director Asher Celzin

Director Celzin's proposal was set before the O5 Council by O5-1, alongside all relevant documentation regarding its testing, updated containment procedures, and mechanisms for utilization as an Overwatch failsafe. The meeting lasted approximately fourteen minutes, at which point it was put to a vote. The results are attached below.
