SCP-8590.
* * *
**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-8590 is currently uncontained. While a reality warper, SCP-8590 does not currently pose a threat to the veil. Containment procedures are to be focused on tracking and documenting SCP-8590’s manifestations and behavior until it can be successfully, permanently contained.
**Description:** SCP-8590 is a 32-year-old human male with reality-warping abilities, including teleportation, manifestation of objects, manipulation of a person's memory, and omniscience.
SCP-8590 uses the combination of its incredibly powerful abilities to work menial, low-paying jobs.
SCP-8590 appears throughout the contiguous United States, usually in the Midwest. How SCP-8590 chooses its locations is unknown; there does not appear to be a pattern. Identification on SCP-8590’s person (name tags, driver's license, etc) only displays the name "Dale." The positions SCP-8590 holds change rapidly based on no known factor; most likely, SCP-8590 simply decides to have a new job and does so.
**Addendum 8590.1:** Discovery and Initial Interactions
During an unrelated investigation in Wisconsin, Foundation Agent Sarah Palmers encountered SCP-8590 when attempting to pick up a check from a local Goodwill.

**«BEGIN LOG»**
_(Palmers approaches SCP-8590 in an aisle. She is holding a vase.)_
**Palmers:** Excuse me?
**SCP-8590:** Hm.
**Palmers:** Is your manager here? I made a drop-off last week and needed to pick up my check.
**SCP-8590:** He's not here today.
**Palmers:** He said he would be here. Do you know when he'll be back?
**SCP-8590:** Not in my job description to know that.
**Palmers:** Alright. _[…]_ Can you tell him to give me a call when he gets back?
**SCP-8590:** I don't really like talking to him.
**Palmers:** You're not being very helpful.
**SCP-8590:** That's your opinion.
**Palmers:** Uh… okay. I was looking at this vase. There's no sticker on it, do you know the price?
**SCP-8590:** Take it.
**Palmers:** Huh?
**SCP-8590:** I wouldn't care if you burned this place to the ground with me in it. Take the vase.
**Palmers:** Okay. Are you sure?
**SCP-8590:** I do not care.
**Palmers:** Alright. Thanks?
_(Palmers moves towards the exit.)_
**SCP-8590:** _(Shouting.)_ The manager's not gonna let you back in the store if you steal that.
_(Palmers stops, then turns towards SCP-8590.)_
**Palmers:** I'm not stealing anything.
**SCP-8590:** You didn't pay for that.
**Palmers:** You literally told me to take it.
**SCP-8590:** I'm not gonna stop you from stealing. I'm just letting you know the manager isn't gonna be happy. He'd probably ban you.
**Palmers:** Then let me buy the fucking thing!
**SCP-8590:** There's no need to use that language, ma'am.
_(SCP-8590 and Agent Palmers walk back to the cash register.)_
**SCP-8590:** Is that all today?
**Palmers:** Jesus fu— yes. That's all.
_(SCP-8590 scans the vase 100 times. Palmers stares, clearly losing patience.)_
**SCP-8590:** That'll be two thousand dollars.
**Palmers:** Are you out of your mind?
**SCP-8590:** No.
**Palmers:** Two _thousand_ dollars?
**SCP-8590:** Yeah.
**Palmers:** That's not odd to you?
**SCP-8590:** I scanned it a hundred times.
**Palmers:** Why the hell would you do that?
**SCP-8590:** You didn't stop me. I thought you wanted a hundred of them.
**Palmers:** I don't _want_ a hundred vases. I want one.
**SCP-8590:** You should have said that.
**Palmers:** This is absurd!
**SCP-8590:** Ma'am, I'm going to have to ask you to leave the store.
**Palmers:** No no no. Don't worry. I'm on my way out anyway.

**«BEGIN LOG»**
_(Agent Palmers' car is being towed.)_
**Palmers:** You've got to be kidding me!
_(Palmers jogs to the tow truck. SCP-8590 is driving.)_
**Palmers:** The hell? Are you towing my car because I didn't buy your vase?
**SCP-8590:** Ma'am, that wouldn't make any sense. You double parked in the handicap section.
**Palmers:** No— I… did I? I guess I did. Can you just help me out?
**SCP-8590:** There's going to be a fine.
**Palmers:** How much?
**SCP-8590:** Do you want a hundred cars or just the one?
**Palmers:** Oh my god. Just _my_ car.
**SCP-8590:** Two thousand dollars.
**Palmers:** Are you serious?
**SCP-8590:** I'm just doing my job.
**Palmers:** _(Mumbling)_ Stupid goddamn— Here.
_(Palmers retrieves 2,000 dollars in cash from her handbag and hands it to SCP-8590.)_
**SCP-8590:** Would you like a bag?
**Palmers:** What? _[…]_ Sure?
**SCP-8590:** Okay.
_(SCP-8590 exits the tow truck and wraps the car in a car-sized plastic bag.)_
**SCP-8590:** Have a nice day.

**«BEGIN LOG»**
_(Agent Palmers' arrives home. She walks into the kitchen and places the very large plastic bag under the sink. Palmers steps in a puddle, then looks up. Her upstairs shower caused a leak in the kitchen.)_
**Palmers:** Goddamn it!
_(Agent Palmers calls a plumber.)_

**[25 minutes of extraneous footage redacted.]**

_(A doorbell is rung. Agent Palmers approaches the door. SCP-8590 is waiting on the other side.)_
**Palmers:** There's no way! Not you _again_!
**SCP-8590:** I was called about a leak.
**Palmers:** How many jobs do you have?
**SCP-8590:** I'm just trying to feed my family, ma'am.
**Palmers:** Do you know what you're doing?
**SCP-8590:** I'm a plumber.
**Palmers:** Are you accredited?
**SCP-8590:** I am a plumber.
**Palmers:** Oh my god. Oh my god. _[…]_ Whatever.
_(Agent Palmers guides SCP-8590 to the location of the leak.)_
**Palmers:** Here.
**SCP-8590:** Hm. Interesting.
**Palmers:** What is?
**SCP-8590:** You have a leak.
**Palmers:** I think I'm losing my mind.
_(SCP-8590 looks at the leaking ceiling.)_
**SCP-8590:** Mhm. Alright. I see.
**Palmers:** What? What do you see?
**SCP-8590:** There's a leak here. I said that already.
_(Agent Palmers cups her head in her hands.)_
**Palmers:** Can— can you fix it?
**SCP-8590:** Yes. This is just a routine pipe replacement.
**Palmers:** Perfect. Thank you.
**SCP-8590:** Wait.
**Palmers:** What's wrong?
**SCP-8590:** One more thing.
**Palmers:** What?
**SCP-8590:** Do you want a hundred pipes or just the one?
