Item #:

 SCP-5148

Object Class:

 Malchut

Special Containment Procedures:

 Procedure 5148-Alpha is to be observed when referring to 

the object class between Chokhmah and Binah

 for all anomalies registered in the Site-19 SCiPnet database. The object class may be spoken aloud, but not typed into the SCiPnet database to prevent the effects of SCP-5148 from manifesting.

Due to the nature of SCP-5148, the anomaly itself and any SCP objects of the same object class are not to be tagged as 

the topmost of the Sephirot

, and are instead designated as Malchut. Use of object class 

the most hidden of things

 is still to be utilized in standard Foundation databases outside of Site-19.

Description:

 SCP-5148 is a digital anomaly affecting the Site-19 SCiPnet database. When an SCP object is tagged and designated as 

the coronal object class

, SCP-5148 will manifest and change all uses of the word to 'Peter', as well as replace any attached image files with crudely drawn images of a character wearing green pants and a white button-up shirt.

SCP-5148 was originally discovered by Alexandra.aic when the construct detected multiple unauthorized edits on hundreds of SCP files hosted on the Site-19 SCiPnet database. Alexandra.aic initially attempted to revert edits on the affected articles, but was unable to do so and alerted Foundation personnel to the problem. To date, all attempts to train AIC to edit files affected by SCP-5148 have failed.

Addendum 5148.01:

 Recovered Chat Logs

The following chat logs were found in an abandoned GoI-5869 'Gamers Against Weed' chatroom by a Foundation webcrawler and are believed to be relevant to SCP-5148. The document has been edited to follow Procedure 5148-Alpha.

lesbian_gengar:

 hey guys you're just in time for my kvetching

lesbian_gengar:

 so like i was saying, the foundation right. they use these things called object classes to designate how dangerous things are.

lesbian_gengar:

 get this

lesbian_gengar:

 they use safe, euclid, and 

that which sits above Tiferet.

bluntfiend:

 OK, and?

lesbian_gengar:

 

regal crown of the sephirot

 as in like the kaballah

bones:

 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabbalah

lesbian_gengar:

 thank you 

bones

 <3

lesbian_gengar:

 so like this matters because 

that with 13 attributes

 is reserved for the most dangerous one

bluntfiend:

 Makes sense, I see it means crown on the wikipedia page.

jockjamsvol6:

 But what does this all mean?

lesbian_gengar:

 idk but isn't it a little sus that a fascist organization is appropriating the kaballah?

jockjamsvol6:

 I see what you mean. It's fucking ridiculous.

lesbian_gengar:

 it is fucking ridiculous. what's next, object class yesod? object class chokhmah? how much more of the kaballah will they appropriate?

mork:

mork:

Bingledorf:

Bingledorf:

juliachildenthusiast:

 When I heard them say it last time they were here, they pronounced it like 'Peter.'

gaycopmp4:

lesbian_gengar:

 smh

lesbian_gengar:

 they're not even pronouncing it right.

bones:

 According to pronounciation guides, it is pronounced 'Kaht-er'.

lesbian_gengar:

 

bones

 you are my bubula today. <3

bones:

 I am grateful for your expression of endearment towards me.

gaycopmp4:

 yo 

lesbian_gengar

gaycopmp4:

 check your PMs

gaycopmp4:

 I have an idea to fuck with them based on what you told us.

bluntfiend:

 You need to be careful with whatever you're doing. The Foundation are no joke nad messing around with them could lead to a lot of bad shit for us, especially if they find out we're directly fucking with them.

bluntfiend:

 *and

bluntfiend:

 

gaycopmp4

 Promise you will be careful?

gaycopmp4:

 dont be such a worrywart, jude. things are different now.

gaycopmp4:

 they can't just come after us without the entire world knowing.

gaycopmp4:

 can you imagine all the bad press that would generate?

gaycopmp4:

 'scp foundation hunts down gay shitposters'

gaycopmp4:

 there would be a media circus. the foundation can't do shit as long as people remember what happened to north korea.

bluntfiend:

 I guess you're right.

bluntfiend:

 But you can't blame me for, you know, caring about everyone here's safety.

gaycopmp4:

 of course not dude but

gaycopmp4:

 no ones going to get hurt from this stupid prank

gaycopmp4:

 besides its about time we got back at them for taking heather

jockjamsvol6:

 Any chance we can get a sneak peek at what you're doing?

gaycopmp4:

 

jockjamsvol6

 let's just say we're lucky there's a family guy. ;)

Note:

 Given the group's reaction to the knowledge of 

the crowned object class

, the Department of Tactical Theology has advised Foundation publicists not to reveal the existence of object class Thaumiel in order to avoid further issues.
