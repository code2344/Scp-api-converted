Item #:

 SCP-4982

Object Class:

 Safe

Special Containment Procedures:

 SCP-4982 is kept in a high-security isolation chamber accessible only to Level-4 personnel and above, outfitted with a surveillance system. Due to the self-containing nature of SCP-4982-1 instances, no additional containment procedures are necessary.

Description:

 SCP-4982 is a modified four-shelf mahogany bookcase carved in French-revival style. Each level is engraved with (from bottom to top) 'Id', 'Ego', 'Mort', and 'Deus', and smaller engravings identify their contents over each SCP-4982-1 instance. A large and pronounced green carving is affixed to the top-center arch of SCP-4982. The following is a computer-generated replication:

Heavy lies the crown of knowledge,

Bringing naught but misery.

These tomes we cast to the darkness,

Never to harm the Garden.

SCP-4982-1 is the group designation for thirteen pieces of documentation of varying length, subject matter, formats and authorship. Each instance possesses individual anomalous properties. There are four instances in each shelf, save for the topmost shelf in which only one is present.

When an instance of SCP-4982-1 is removed from SCP-4982 all shelves save for the one disturbed will shut via an unknown mechanism.

 Once shut, the compartments will not open until the removed SCP-4982-1 instance is returned. If an SCP-4982-1 instance is moved outside a 2m radius of SCP-4982, that instance will disappear and manifest in the shelf beneath its appropriate inscription.

A list of each SCP-4982-1 instance follows, alongside its identification plaque.
