SCP-6876

 - Disgusting

More by me!

 

Special Containment Procedures:

 At this time, SCP-6876 is uncontained. Foundation personnel are to be explicitly restricted from entering Site-400's third-floor men's restroom. Any individuals possessing relevant information regarding SCP-6876 are encouraged to report it to the current research head (presently Dr. Derik Gusmann of the Department of Spectral Phenomena).

Site-400's third-floor men's restroom.

Description:

 SCP-6876 is the designation given to a spectral phantasmic entity of an as-of-yet unknown Class

1

, currently believed to be inhabiting (or "haunting") the third-floor men's restroom in Site-400. During the time of its brief manifestation, SCP-6876 was seen wearing a Foundation-issued 

Janitorial and Maintenance

 uniform, with its mouth obscured by a blue surgical-type face mask.

SCP-6876 momentarily appeared on the 5th of May, 2018, and was seen vocalizing for a few seconds in the presence of Dr. Nigel Henderson, before demanifesting. The following is a transcript of the event, initially recovered from a surveillance camera implemented in the bathroom:

<Begin Log>

Footage shows the view of the restroom in its entirety, with the stalls, urinals, and washing sinks visible. The sound of a toilet flushing is heard, and Dr. Henderson exits one of the stalls and proceeds to throw a clump of tissue paper in a nearby wastebasket.

He lifts both of his hands to his nose and sniffs his fingers, before shrugging and attempting to exit the bathroom. At this point, SCP-6876 manifests directly in front of Dr. Henderson, holding a wet mop and a metal bucket.

SCP-6876:

 Bro, what are you doing? That's disgusting.

Dr. Henderson:

 (

looks up

) What the-?

SCP-6876:

 You're a doctor, for god's sake. Go wash your hands!

SCP-6876 proceeds to demanifests. Dr. Henderson looks around his surroundings and briefly glances at a nearby sink. He shrugs once again and exits the bathroom, his hands still unwashed.

<End Log>

Dr. Henderson reported the above incident to on-site security, and an official investigation was conducted, resulting in the recovery of the video camera. After reviewing the footage, personnel has concluded that SCP-6876 was, in nature, a spectral entity. As such, the Department of Spectral Phenomena has been assigned to properly research SCP-6876.

 

ON-FILE COMMENTARY

I would like to request the removal of the video transcript, if possible. I suggest using a "timeline-of-events" type thing, specifically with my name redacted or expunged. I think we can all agree that I've learned my lesson on bathroom etiquette. - 

Dr. Nigel Henderson

Request denied. Let this be an example to you and everyone else. - 

Dr. Derik Gusmann

Please? - 

Dr. Nigel Henderson
