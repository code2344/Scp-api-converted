Dr. Luttrell,
It has come to my attention that the SCP-7826 database entry was compromised again with the same revisions as we've seen previously.
This is the fifth time that this has occurred and it seems that IT has yet to determine the cause.
I hope that you have been looking into whether or not this is related to some unknown quality of the anomaly given the security threat this could pose to not only the Site's data integrity, but to that of the overall Foundation database. Please inform me if you will need additional resources for this project.
I advise that you reach out to the IT staff assigned to this incident [claude.harris@site53.scp.org]. You may be able to collaborate on determining the cause of these recurrent modifications.

Director Perkins,
Thank you for bringing this to my attention once again.
After the first instance I ensured that I and my staff kept hard copies of our notes and the item logs so I will be able to restore the entry with minimal loss of information.
At this time, I believe that there may be more than just physical objects arriving through the anomaly. I will keep you abreast of any new developments.

I woke up and you were gone.
Everyone else forgot you. I won't.
I know you're not gone.  

* * *
#### Description
* * *
  
Your hair is soft and wraps so easily around my fingers.
Your smile fills my soul with a beautiful song.
I can hear it now.  

* * *
#### Addendum 7826.1: Us
* * *
  
Our lives are enmeshed. That can't be gone. It can't be nothing. There is no hole in my heart for you to fall through.
Eden tells me that she doesn't know her mom. I keep trying to find pictures of you to show her, but you're all gone.
There's just me crying, ring in hand kneeling in front of nothing. Just me sitting on the plane. Just me walking down the beach. Just me holding our baby girl.
I know that you're there.
Wherever you are, I hope this guides you home.  

* * *
#### Addendum 7826.2: The First Time
* * *
  
I lived a life filled with fear and doubt. Every day I knew there was something that was wrong with me.
Your face, your laugh, your warmth, it melted all those thoughts away.
For the first time I knew that I wasn't broken, that I had a home.  

**BEGIN LOG**
* * *
> **18:42 - 09 JAN 2008** \- I met you at a party last week. I knew that you were special. I was afraid that you didn't feel the same about me. You invited me and some friends over to your place. It was only my second time seeing you. I hoped that I would get to see you a lot more.
**You** \- Hi, I'm glad you made it. I'm still getting dinner together right now if you want to come and help me.
**Me** \- Hey, for sure. What do you want me to do?
**You** \- These vegetables are all chopped now. Can you add those to the stirfry and finish that up?
**Me** \- I think I can do that.
`_[I was terrified of being in that kitchen with you.]_`
**You** \- You can get a drink too if you want.
**Me** \- I know I can do that.
`_[I made a cocktail with whatever was closest. As soon as someone said the word "shots" two of those went down too.]_`
**You** \- Dinner is all ready guys!
`_[Everyone sat down and ate. I was feeling better now. We were both laughing and stealing glances at one another. I got up to go to the kitchen and you took me aside.]_`
**You** \- I'm glad you made it here.
**Me** \- For dinner?
**You** \- Let's get another drink.
`_[We wandered off and sat on the couch in your living room. We talked for hours about everything. Your friends kept popping their heads in to make sure that everything was going okay and that your plan had worked.]_`
**Me** \- I have to get going, even though I really don't want to.
**You** \- I know.
**Me** \- Do you want to go on an actual date this weekend?
**You** \- Yes.
**Me** \- I'll send you the address of a place I like nearby. You'll love it.
**You** \- That sounds perfect.
**Me** \- Before I go, is it okay that I kiss you goodnight?
**You** \- Yes it is.
`_[It was a wonderful moment.]_`

#### Addendum 7826.3: Your Hand in Mine
* * *
  
So many moments filled with wonder and love.
The touch of your skin against mine is burnt into my mind.
Your voice eternally rings through my soul.  

**Our First Date**
**Subject:** A cold night in a warm bar.
**Procedure:** I got there first. I had started my second drink when you walked in. You were stunning.
* * *
You sat down and ordered your drink. We settled on fries to share. You got mac and cheese and I got a burger.
Hours went by. You told me your secrets. I shared my fears.
When we walked outside. I took your hand because I didn't want you to fall on the ice. It was so tender.
We kissed at your car. You went home.
* * *
**Results:** We both knew we would spend our lives together.
**Analysis:** That can't all be gone.
  

**Our Wedding**
**Subject:** A warm evening on a beautiful beach.
**Procedure:** Not spending the day with you was torture. I kept wanting to share my thoughts with my best friend and you weren't there.
* * *
I stood there waiting. And waiting. You finally walked out. You were what beauty dreams of becoming.
A flowing white dress, flowers in your hair, the song you picked ringing in my ears.
When you finally made it to me, you held my hands in yours.
You read yours first. I went second. I couldn't hold back my tears.
* * *
**Results:** We kissed and the rest of our lives started.
**Analysis:** Our souls won't let go.
  

* * *
#### Addendum 7826.4: Growing Together
* * *
  
There was no end to the how much you thought I could do, how much I could be.
I never let myself think those things. You melt fear and doubt.
When I was at my most afraid, you showed me that our love could let us build a miracle.  

I thought you might like to know something‚Ä¶
The test is positive ü•∞
I need you to call me.
I can't breathe.
It's going to be okay, bubby
I know that you were hesitant about this, but it's going to be a magical journey :)
Have faith in me and us and everything will be okay, I promise ‚ù§Ô∏è
You know that I love you, but I can't do this
There's nothing we can't do
You're going to be an amazing father :)
  
  
And you were right. There's nothing we can't do.  

I finally got her down‚Ä¶ Now it's my nap time üòÖ
My loves ü•∞
She looks so happy ‚ù§Ô∏è
I forgot to turn my ringer off and now she's up again‚Ä¶
Look at her showing all these kids like the little plant momma she is ü§£
Takes after her mom ‚ù§Ô∏è
So proud ü•∞
I'm so happy that you worked on getting that school garden project started for her :)
  

Feel for my hand.
The hand that held yours through the most precious years of my life.
Let my love be your guiding light.  

* * *
#### Addendum 7826.5: You Are So Close.
* * *
  
You helped me feel loved and accepted in ways that I didn't know were possible.
Now I hope that those feelings can bring you back to me.
I hope this bottle finds your shore.
See you soon, baby girl.

Mr. Harris,
Director Perkins reached out to me regarding the SCP-7826 entry being modified once again.
I believe that the alterations may be stemming from the anomaly itself. Based on our sensor data, each entry alteration has been preceded by the same atmospheric aberrations that we have seen before the appearance of a new object.
Once we are able to locate and secure the anomaly these alterations should cease.
Until then, please move the entry into one of the site's Faraday-isolated servers. That may prevent these modifications from appearing again.

#### Special Containment Procedures
* * *
  
Objects determined to have originated from SCP-7826 are to be cataloged in this entry and stored within Site-53 Secure Containment Wing "Yellowstone." Each item is to be screened for any anomalous traits and hazardous properties prior to storage. These items are denoted as SCP-7826-A#.
To date, all objects that have been recovered from SCP-7826 have been determined to be safe and as such can are stored according to minimal security protocols.  

* * *
#### Description
* * *
  
SCP-7826 occupies an unknown area of space near Site-53 that allows objects from one dimension to be transcribed into our own. Items originating from SCP-7826 possess unique levels of entropic energy allowing them to be distinguished from our reality. Each of these items have appeared within a 10 sq km area surrounding Site-53.
Given that each recovered item is congruous with what one would expect its superficial appearance to be, it is difficult to determine the quantity of objects that have been dispensed by SCP-7826 or how long the anomaly has been active.
An array of atmospheric sensors have been placed in the area around Site-53 which have been able to detect the appearance of new objects. New objects will be proceeded by minute atmospheric disruptions which are localized to the area where the object manifests.
The anomaly's exact location has yet to be found. However, new objects have tended to appear in the area directly north of Site-53.

Kelly,
I know this isn't you.
Somewhere in there is the woman I married.
The mother of our child.
Look at those pictures of her.
Look at her and me and remember.
Please.

**Subject:** Staff Roster Notice
* * *
Director Perkins,
During the retrieval process of SCP-7826, I noticed that the current site roster is not in-line with archived Foundation records.
Researcher Kelly Luttrell and Technician Claude Harris do not appear to have been registered during their on-boarding process.
Please inform me if you would like this to be rectified.
Also of note, Mr. Harris may need a disciplinary meeting regarding his adherence to the site's clock-in policy as it appears that he has no history of actually logging a shift.

Claude,
I remember when I got you that music box. You told me that you love that song, that it gave you peace.
That ring. I never cried harder in my life. I knew you were going to ask me, but I never knew that I could feel that elated and ecstatic.
Our home. Each room filled with mementos and plants, never enough though.
Eden. That was the only name you and I agreed on. You took such good care of us for the nine months I grew her, and for every moment after that.
My loves. You're both so beautiful.
There's nothing we can't do.
I'll be with you soon.
