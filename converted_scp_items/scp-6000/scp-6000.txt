NOTICE FROM THE FOUNDATION RECORDS, ARCHIVAL, AND INFORMATION SECURITY ADMINISTRATION

The following two file revisions were found in the SCP-6000 slot when it was automatically pregenerated as an empty placeholder by SCiPnet on June 25th, 2022. No file history was available.

Due to the content therein and the questionable circumstances of its discovery, the O5 Council has elected to leave this file unaltered. 

None of the events that follow have occurred in baseline reality. The coordinates listed as the location of SCP-6000 contain nothing of note.

— Maria Jones, Director, RAISA
