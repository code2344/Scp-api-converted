Keter

Special Containment Procedures:

 Any attempts to view the area of space containing SCP-2743 via high-powered telescope are to be covertly sabotaged. Due to the size of SCP-2743 instances and its distance from Earth, academic and government-backed astronomy centers are the only institutions that require monitoring.

Observational satellites have been placed in orbit around each instance, as well as three surface probes equipped with a thermonuclear device with a yield of approximately 30 megatons.

In the event of discovery, a cover story is to be disseminated among the astronomy community attributing all findings to a practical joke. The original publisher of the report or photographs is to be discredited by any means necessary. At this point, the thermonuclear probes must be detonated to prevent a Broken Masquerade scenario.

Because of the continual advancements in the fields of astronomy and space exploration, the discovery of SCP-2743 is considered an inevitability if it remains in its current orbit. As such, the ongoing development of physical containment methods for SCP-2743 instances is a Class IV Priority.

SCP-2743 highlighted on an orbital scan of Saturn's outer satellites.

Description:

 SCP-2743 designates four organic satellites within Saturn's Phoebe Ring.

1

 These satellites, ranging from 2km - 5km in length, have been identified as the corpses of four Jötnar-Class

2

 humanoid entities, documented as SCP-2743-1 through SCP-2743-4. All four instances were discovered wearing armor and clothing resembling 10th-century depictions of Norse mythological warriors.

Report/2743-1

Discovery

2000/2/23 Rhea Orbital Satellite revealed SCP-2743-1 approximately 13 Gm from Saturn's outer atmosphere.

Subject

Subject is a humanoid entity measuring 2.1 km in length with a physical appearance of a human female between 8-10 years of age.

Notes

Subject appears to have expired due to blunt force trauma to the zygomatic and maxilla region which caused the entity's facial structure to collapse inward. A large portion of the subject's hair had been forcibly removed, along with three fingers from its left hand.

Report/2743-2/2743-3

Discovery

2003/5/13 Rhea Orbital Satellite revealed SCP-2743-2 and SCP-2743-3 in close proximity. Subjects are approximately 15 Gm from Saturn's outer atmosphere.

Subject

SCP-2743-2 is a humanoid entity measuring 2.9 km in length resembling a human male, approximately 13-14 years of age. SCP-2743-3 is a humanoid entity measuring 3.8 km in length, subject's body structure correlates to a human female of approximately 35-40 years of age.

Notes

SCP-2743-2 was found with its sternum shattered and its ribcage separated from the thoracic vertebrae outwards. SCP-2743-2's lungs had been removed and stretched over its ribcage.

3

 Based on collagen formation at the sites where ribs had punctured the lungs, SCP-2743-2 remained in this state for an extended period of time. Additionally, self-defense injuries were noted on its hand and forearms. SCP-2743-3 was found holding SCP-2743-2, its likely cause of death is decapitation. The location of SCP-2743-3's head is unknown.

Report/2743-4

Discovery

Due to its orbital location SCP-2743-4 was discovered on 2006/9/28 by the Rhea Orbital Satellite, approximately 17 Gm from Saturn's outer atmosphere.

Subject

SCP-2743-4 is a humanoid entity measuring 4.6 km in length with the physical appearance of a human male between 35-45 years of age.

Notes

The surface of SCP-2743-4's body is covered in severe Lichtenberg figure

4

 scarring. The subject's ocular, nasal, and oral passages show signs of charring and necrosis. The likely cause of death is repeated exposure to high voltage electrical currents. An object resembling a 10th-century Norse sword (measuring 3 km in length), was placed through SCP-2743-4's head on the longitudinal axis, exiting the torso via the groin. Evidence indicates this was done posthumously. A granite slab measuring 1.1 km in length was discovered near SCP-2743-4. This slab, designated SCP-2743-4a, has Norse runes etched into the surface,
