Item #:

 SCP-8908

Object Class:

 Keter

Special Containment Procedures:

 Due to its astronomical scale and location approximately 700 million light-years from Earth, SCP-8908 cannot be physically contained. Efforts are focused on information suppression and memetic countermeasures within academic and amateur astronomical communities. Satellite imagery and deep space observation data referencing the region designated as the Boötes Void are to be intercepted and replaced with doctored versions reflecting expected cosmic background radiation and galactic distribution.

Automated webcrawlers (

I/O-AXIOM-12

) are to monitor for discussions of SCP-8908 across scientific publications, forums, and public databases. Civilians or astronomers exhibiting obsessive behaviours regarding the Boötes Void are to be detained, amnesticized, and monitored indefinitely.

Description:

 SCP-8908 refers to the region of space commonly known as the 

Boötes Void

, a vast expanse approximately 330 million light-years in diameter, almost completely devoid of galaxies. While previously believed to be a naturally occurring cosmic void, new data obtained through Foundation deep-field telescopes (see 

Addendum 8908.1

) confirms that SCP-8908 is not empty, but rather occluded by a large-scale anomalous phenomenon.

Boötes Void

Within SCP-8908, visible matter and electromagnetic radiation are selectively negated or redirected, rendering conventional observation techniques ineffective. Gravitational lensing studies suggest the presence of approximately 8×10¹² solar masses of matter unaccounted for by visible galaxy structures, distributed in configurations inconsistent with any known galactic formations.

Signals intercepted by Foundation probes near the edge of SCP-8908 include low-frequency modulations that exhibit complex, non-random patterns. These have been designated as SCP-8908-A and are hypothesized to be intentional transmissions. Decryption attempts are ongoing; however, several decoded fragments appear to contain recursive linguistic structures with cognitohazardous properties (see Incident 8908-KAIROS).

Addendum 8908.1 — Initial Discovery:

 On ██/██/201█, Deep Space Observation Array Ypsilon-9 detected a persistent anomaly in background radiation emissions near the Boötes constellation. Spectral analysis revealed a 94% deviation from expected thermal signatures, prompting the deployment of the Foundation vessel Svalinn. Upon entering high orbit near the periphery of SCP-8908, the crew began experiencing acute psychological disturbances, leading to ████████████████.

Mission logs recovered from the Svalinn's AI core before its unexplained systems failure contain the phrase:

"We are not looking at emptiness. We are being looked at through it."

Addendum 8908.2 — Message Fragment (Redacted):

 A partially decrypted sequence from SCP-8908-A was translated by the Memetics Division. Exposure requires a Level 4 cognitohazard clearance. Non-cleared personnel attempting access will trigger automated memory purge protocols.

…WE HAVE WATCHED THE LIGHTS GO OUT …STARS ARE SCARS LEFT BY THOSE WHO TRIED …THEY BUILT A WALL OF EMPTY TO KEEP IT AWAY …YOU HAVE NOT BUILT ENOUGH EMPTY

Following this transmission, ██ Foundation researchers experienced identical hypnagogic episodes of approaching a "

city-sized lattice

" made of gravitational singularities, described as "

a museum of failed universes.

Incident 8908-KAIROS:

 On ██/██/20██, a temporary lapse in containment protocols led to a live feed from SCP-8908 being broadcast to three major observatories, with some auditory devices emitting what surrounding researchers believed to be a 

Rick Roll

, which is a meme stemming from online forum communities.
