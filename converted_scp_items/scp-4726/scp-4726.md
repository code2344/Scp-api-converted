**Item #:** SCP-4726

SCP-4726 secretes an opaque liquid substance (hereafter referred to as SCP-4726-1) at a rate of 1.4 liters per hour. The chemical composition of SCP-4726-1 consists of caffeine, sugar, taurine, and other folic acids. Consumption of SCP-4726-1 influences the neurotransmitters for norepinephrine, dopamine, and acetylcholine in a similar process as non-anomalous caffeinated beverages.
