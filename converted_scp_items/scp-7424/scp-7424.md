SCP-7424
**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7424 is to be stored in a standard containment locker at Site-18. Access to SCP-7424 is restricted to Level 2 personnel and above. Cannabis products are strictly prohibited on the containment floor.
**Description:** SCP-7424 is a blue gardening spade measuring 20 centimeters in length with a wooden handle and a metal blade. The words "WEED-B-GONE" are written with a black permanent marker on the left side of the handle.
SCP-7424's anomalous properties activate when brought within a 10-meter proximity to any tissue, materials, or combustion byproducts derived from plants of the genus _Cannabis_ (commonly known as marijuana). These properties also encompass any items associated with the recreational use of marijuana as a psychoactive drug.
Upon activation, SCP-7424's blade exerts a gravitational force on these materials, attracting them and subsequently absorbing them into itself. No trace of the absorbed objects have ever been found. Afterwards, SCP-7424 proceeds to launch itself at a velocity of approximately 30 meters per second towards any individual(s) who last made use of the aforementioned items, often resulting in serious injury. In case no such individual is present within its 10-meter activation radius, the anomaly will target the next individual to enter its effective range.
**Addendum:**  
SCP-7424 came to the Foundation's attention following a series of disruptive events at a marijuana dispensary in Denver, Colorado, USA. Local authorities reported that an individual identified as Reece Stoneman had entered the establishment wielding SCP-7424. Individuals involved in the incident were hospitalized and amnesticized. After further investigation, the following online chat logs have been recovered:

Less painful than looking at yours.
mrwhitesphere
12:16
Shut up nerd.
TheReezer
12:17
Hahah  
But uhhh  
Yeah  
I've actually been developing a little thing. Well, it's actually kinda big if. If I do say so myself.
EmptySausage
12:17
@BannedAlsoBtw. Don't say it.
BannedAlsoBtw
12:17
That's what she said.
EmptySausage
12:18
I will smack you with the fridge again.
BannedAlsoBtw
12:19
EmptySausage
12:20
That's it! *kicks your balls*
BannedAlsoBtw
12:20
I've got more balls than you ever will.
EmptySausage
12:21
Sorry about that lol. please continue. What is this big thing you want to speak about?
TheReezer
12:21
Well it's something a lil… let's say supernatural.
BannedAlsoBtw

TheReezer
12:23
Yes. It's my first ever spooky thing so I'm not precisely… good at it. I have no idea what I'm doing to be frank.
EmptySausage
12:23
It's fine lol, we all started somewhere no?
mrwhitesphere
12:24
Not me, I've always been a god among men.

mrwhitesphere
12:26
a shovel
DullSilver
12:26
do you live in a white void??
Mr. Found
12:26
that looks more like a spade
mrwhitesphere
12:26
what's even the difference?
Mr. Found
12:27
"A shovel typically has a curved blade and is used for digging. On the other hand, a spade has a flat blade and is used for cutting and removing soil."
BannedAlsoBtw
12:27
EmptySausage
12:28
What about the shovel?
Mr. Found
12:28
Spade*
TheReezer
12:30
It's called the "Weed-B-Gone" cuz you know "weed" is like a double entendre. Cuz gardeening has weeds and cuz you know "Gamers Against Weeds"
Mr. Found
12:30
We get it, we get it.
TheReezer
12:30
I made it so that it absorbs all the weed around it. It'll siphon out smoke from the air and grab blunts and stuff like that.
DullSilver
12:30
Yoo that's awesome. I could use something like that. So how do you get it back?
TheReezer
12:30
What you mean?
DullSilver
12:30
How you get the weed, I don't see like a hole or nothin
TheReezer
12:31
What?
BannedAlsoBtw
12:31
They said: **"HOW DO YOU GET THE WEED, I DON'T SEE LIKE A HOLE OR NOTHIN"**
TheReezer
12:32
Well, you don't. It gets rid of the weed. After it detects who was responsible for it, It hits them in the head. Not too hard, just like a lil boop, I made sure of that.
DullSilver
12:32
In all seriousness like what does it actually do tho. Or is it literally just a normal shovel. I mean if you didn't actually make full-on spooky shit just for the bit that's fair, I don't think anyone can blame you.
Mr. Found
12:33
_SPADE_ *
DullSilver
12:33
whatever
TheReezer
12:32
What bit?
DullSilver
12:33
this was funny at first but you dragged it out for wayyy too long
mrwhitesphere
12:33
Wait, yall don't think they're serious, do yall?
EmptySausage
12:34
What? Nahhh
mrwhitesphere
12:34
@EmptySausage. Did you remember to say the name was ironic when you invited them
EmptySausage
12:34
Of course I did, I always do
mrwhitesphere
12:35
Check
EmptySausage
12:37
Shit.
TheReezer
12:38
…Ironic?
mrwhitesphere
12:38
Yeah GAW is supposed to be ironic. We don't actually fight against weed.
Emptysausage
12:39
We're just making fun of overly self-righteous groups. The whole "Gamers Against Weed" thing is a parody.
TheReezer
12:38
You- you're kidding right?
BannedAlsoBtw
12:38
wait shit they were fr fr this whole time?
DullSilver
12:39
They appear to have been
TheReezer
12:39
I really thought we were against weed! How can this be a joke? Ya'll are just fucking with me right? Please tell me ya'll are.
N.Y. Booze
12:40
Yeah, but that's besides the point
TheReezer
12:40
Oh, you know what? FUCK. YALL.
DullSilver
12:45

EmptySausage
12:45

TheReezer
12:44
Yeah, I said it, _go fuck yourselves_
EmptySausage
12:40
let's calm down for a second. It's all in good fun.
TheReezer
12:41
Good fun!? You have no idea how much time I've invested in this! The "Anti-Weedinator" is a marvel of weed eradication technology!
DullSilver
12:41
I thought it was called the Weed-B-Gone
TheReezer
12:42
I CHANGED MY MIND OKAY? Is that a fucking crime!?
N.Y Booze
12:42
DID SOMEBODY SAY CRIME?
EmptySausage
12:43

N.Y Booze
12:44

And I'm taking my shovel with me.
BannedAlsoBtw
12:48

TheReezer
12:48

EmptySausage
12:50
