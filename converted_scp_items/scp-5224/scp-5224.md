SCP-5224
**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-5224 is held in a waterless terrarium otherwise suited for amphibians. SCP-5224 is never to come within 100 meters of water.
Frogs created by SCP-5224 must be terminated and disposed of per standard biological waste disposal methods.
**Description:** SCP-5224 is a female marsh frog _(Pelophylax ridibundus)_. It does not experience senescence, and it does not need to eat, drink or breathe.
If SCP-5224 croaks within 100 meters from a body of water, it will start to go through eutrophication,[1](javascript:;) and additional members of the order _Anura_[2](javascript:;) will begin to manifest within it. Said frogs will always be native to the area, and the rate of frogs produced is 5000 per 1 cubic meter per second. This will continue until SCP-5224 stops croaking.
After manifestation, produced frogs will instantly head towards the nearest site of plant agriculture. Upon arrival, they will begin to consume insect life at a rate that is highly damaging to the ecological balance of the region. Aside from this and their method of creation, produced frogs are non-anomalous.

**Incident Report 5224.1:** On 29/01/21, a peregrine falcon holding a clay pot materialized in SCP-5224's containment chamber. It dropped the pot, grabbed SCP-5224, and disappeared.
Upon inspection, carvings on the pot were found to contain a message written in hieroglyphic script:
> Apologies for any problems my wife might have caused. Sent our son to fetch her. She's been a little confused ever since the days of Babylon when she became associated with plagues instead of fertility and crops.
> If y'all could stop changing our domains, that'd be appreciated.
> With love, Khnum.
Investigation into the whereabouts of SCP-5224 is ongoing.
