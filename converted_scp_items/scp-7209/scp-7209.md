**O5 COUNCIL RECORD**
* * *
**O5-7:** Fuck.
**O5-11:** Why was he even travelling to-
**O5-8:** Doesn’t matter now.
**O5-5:** Like hell it doesn’t matter, what if one of us is next?
**O5-9:** Should we enter lockdown?
**O5-4:** I’d recommend against that. We’re running low on food here.
**O5-3:** `Approximately 16 days of rations remaining, under the assumption all living Council Members gain an equal share of the available sustenance.`
**O5-6:** Well, you don’t need anything, little Mac.
**O5-4:** What?
**O5-6:** Y’all ain’t never heard of _Punch Out_? And 3’s a computer thing, so-
**O5-11:** Hey, 13, you don’t need food either, right?
_A featureless dark figure manifests in the chair labeled "13"._
**O5-13:** Not technically.
**O5-5:** Kay, that extends us at least a few days. I say we kill 6 first.
**O5-6:** Over my dead body, you Fifthist maniac.
**O5-8:** That _is_ what killing you does.
**O5-1:** All of you stop talking, right now. We’re not killing anyone.
**O5-5:** Damn.
**O5-1:** We have plans in place for situations just like this.
**O5-4:** We do?
**O5-3:** `Yes. OPERATION ROYALE.`
**O5-1:** Exactly. 10, would you mind-
**O5-10:** No.
**O5-1:** Excuse me?
**O5-10:** I’m saying no. We agreed to never try ROYALE again. I’m not making the department compliant with this.
**O5-6:** Can someone just tell us what the hell this "royale" is anyway?
_O5-1 distributes a paper document to each council member. All of them read it, then look back at O5-1 with shock._
**O5-7:** Sorry, what?
**O5-11:** You- who wrote this?
**O5-10:** Me. Technically. A long time ago. But that doesn’t mean-
**O5-6:** I’m in.
**O5-5:** Same.
**O5-10:** You can’t possibly be serious.
**O5-6:** Seems like a good qualifier to me.
**O5-10:** You _cannot_ be serious.
**O5-3:** `There are some ethical considerations to be had with this-`
**O5-10:** Exactly.
**O5-3:** `However, has any other council member brought forth any solution?`
**O5-1:** There’s not.
**O5-7:** It's not completely unusable. And with the resources we have now, rather than 30 years ago, this seems like a good choice.
**O5-10:** Hold on, don’t we already have a shortlist for candidates? Why would we need to do this?
**O5-4:** The list is too long right now. I don’t know, this seems a little… barbaric, but this does narrow it down.
**O5-11:** List helps put this together too.
**O5-2:** Let us put it to a vote. Formally, a democratic decision.
**O5-10:** No.
**O5-1:** All those in favor of a vote?
**O5-10:** _No._
_All council members except for O5-10 raise their available voting appendages._
**O5-1:** Terrific.

Hello, Personnel! You and a select group of personnel have been selected by the O5 Council in conjunction with the Interpersonnel Trifecta of Departments for transfer to a new Foundation facility, dedicated to the containment of a highly classified and important anomaly as part of "PROJECT ROYALE". You have been noted for high proficiency in your field and displayed loyalty towards the Foundation. You will be required to move on-site for the continuous containment efforts against SCP-7209. This email and all contents are highly classified - revealing any such information is punishable by termination.
You will soon receive a preliminary copy of the SCP-7209 file, available for your clearance.

**SPECIAL CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES:** SCP-7209 is contained within SCP-7209-1. SCP-7209-1 is contained through the standard Veil Maintenance Protocol applied to all Foundation Secure Facilities. More information regarding SCP-7209 will be available upon your transfer to Site-Gamma.
**DESCRIPTION:** SCP-7209-1 is Site-Gamma, a Foundation facility located in ████-██, ███████████. Originally constructed for usage in [REDACTED], Site-Gamma become the containment location of SCP-7209 after the anomaly was discovered nearby.
SCP-7209-1 is built in 3 distinct wings; RESIDENCE, RESEARCH, and CONTAINMENT. The RESIDENCE wing is non-anomalous and encompasses the perimeter of the facility.
The CONTAINMENT wing, composed of the central storage room for SCP-7209 and the surrounding observation booths, is located at the center of Site-Gamma. All structures in CONTAINMENT are made from an alloy of beryllium bronze and SCP-148, with the intent of counteracting any physical, mental, or thaumaturgical harm posed by the anomaly. 6 restabilized SRA Devices[1](javascript:;) are located in the perimeter of CONTAINMENT, and have been restabilized into conjoining objectively with the surrounding materials.
More information regarding SCP-7209 will be available upon your transfer to Site-Gamma.

[BEGIN LOG]
**E. Kursh:** Well, it seems everyone is here. I hope the trip to Site-Gamma was-
**J. Gardner:** Cut the chase, desk jockey. What's the job this time?
**E. Kursh:** Okay. I'll cut the formalities then. Hello, my name is Ethel Kursh, and I am the HR Liaison assigned to the 7 of you for the purposes of PROJECT ROYALE.
**M. Teckler:** Yeah, about that, what? The document you sent us for SCP-7209 had, like, nothing of value.
**I. Neer:** Not even a map of this facility. Just a piss-poor description.
**R. Hishikaku:** Glad somebody brought that up. Who wrote this document? It's littered with basic technical errors.
**E. Kursh:** I assure you, everyone, that things will be explained eventually. Now if I could _please_ continue explaining why you're here, that would be appreciated.
**B. ██████:** Go right ahead.
**J. Gardner:** Sorry, who's the Batman wannabe? I ain't never seen you around.
**A. Radu:** You've seen us around?
**J. Gardner:** Uh. No, but still. Looks suspicious.
**E. Kursh:** You'll all have time to introduce yourselves personally later - but yes, you probably haven't seen Mr… well, him, before.
**B. ██████:** Espionage.
**M. Teckler:** Tracks.
**E. Kursh:** Anyway. The 7 of you have been brought here, as outlined in the email you all received yesterday, to be the heads of your respective fields at Site-Gamma. Each of you is uniquely qualified and possesses level 4 clearance to boot, so you've been selected as the candidates for this facility.
**M. Teckler:** What are their "respective fields"?
**J. Gardner:** Defence.
**P. Baldwin:** RAISA. So, archival stuff. Documents.
**R. Hishikaku:** Analogue Intelligence.
**J. Gardner:** AI?
**R. Hishikaku:** That would be Artificial Intelligence.
**J. Gardner:** The difference being?
**I. Neer:** Not one we need to care about right now. Administrative staff.
**M. Teckler:** Hey, aren't you the Site-18 Director?
**I. Neer:** Indeed I-
**M. Teckler:** You guys ever figure out that pig lady?
**I. Neer:** What?
**M. Teckler:** Always wanted to see what's up with that one, freaky document too. Chills.
**I. Neer:** That's- I would prefer if you didn't refer to an anomaly like that with such lax.
**M. Teckler:** Sorry, sorry. Anyway, my field, right? General Research.
**R. Hishikaku:** General Research? As in, Site-37 General Research?
**M. Teckler:** That would be correct!
**I. Neer:** Explains a hell of a lot.
**M. Teckler:** Excuse me?
**P. Baldwin:** Ethel, please, don't tell me this is the group you're bringing here. Please.
**E. Kursh:** Every person here is, like I said, uniquely qualified for this job.
**B. ██████:** Speaking of everyone… who are _you_?
_██████ points at Dr. Radu. He is standing behind Gardner and tries to hide himself when noticed. Gardner moves to the side._
**A. Radu:** Ah, um. Hi. Dr. Radu.
**M. Teckler:** Don't care about your name, dude. Department?
**A. Radu:** Oh. Archaeology.
**J. Gardner:** What?
**R. Hishikaku:** Archaeology?
**A. Radu:** Yeah. Anomalous archaeology, to be specific.
_A moment of silence. Gardner, ██████, and Teckler begin to laugh._
**M. Teckler:** You're joking. I didn't know we had a department of- What do you even do?
**B. ██████:** Not seeing a lot of rocks in this sleek metal facility.
**P. Baldwin:** I think you three need to fuck right off.
**J. Gardner:** Sure, librarian. Sure we do.
**E. Kursh:** That's enough, from all of you. You're going to need to figure out your differences quickly because everyone - even the Archaeology department - is needed for this.
**M. Teckler:** Right, right, sorry, it's just-
**E. Kursh:** Murphy, there's a room back at 37 for you, if you want to object.
_Teckler goes silent._
**M. Teckler:** No need, ma'am. Apologies.
**A. Radu:** So, uh, question?
**E. Kursh:** Yes Anton?
**A. Radu:** Right, so, you mentioned that this assignment requires all of us. What exactly _is_ SCP-7209?
**E. Kursh:** My next point exactly. Chairs of the Site-Gamma Departments, SCP-7209 is-
_Kursh is interrupted by the sounds and lights of multiple site-wide klaxons blaring._
**P. Baldwin:** Oh, fuck, what?
**M. Teckler:** Already?
**J. Gardner:** Red light means to run, soldiers!
**E. Kursh:** This- this is probably just a test of the alarm system, surely nothing to be wary of.
**I. Neer:** A test of the alarms? We've been here for not even 20 minutes, why would they be testing the- You're HR for god's sake, aren't you supposed to know about things like this?
**E. Kursh:** I- yes, yes I am, and I don't. Goddamn it.
**B. ██████:** Enough talking everyone, more getting the fuck out of-
_██████ attempts to open the door to the lobby, which has been hermetically sealed off._
**B. ██████:** Excuse me?
_Behind ██████, a vent covering on the wall is opened. A leather-gloved hand sticks through and throws in a small metal canister, which immediately starts releasing a viscous gas. The hand retracts._
**J. Gardner:** You have got to be fucking kidding me.
**P. Baldwin:** What the hell is that?
**B. ██████:** I don't- I don't know, it looks… it looks like…
**M. Teckler:** Hello? Earth to spy, we could use your knowledge right…
**J. Gardner:** Fuck. Knockout gas.
**R. Hishikaku:** Is… do you not have anything to…
**A. Radu:** Cover your faces, cover your faces!
**E. Kursh:** That's not…
**I. Neer:** We need to… we need to try…
**A. Radu:** There has to be an open… there has to be a… there…
_All 8 personnel in the room fall unconscious on the floor. Several figures in tactical gear open the door to the lobby and carry the personnel, except for Ethel Kursh, towards the central CONTAINMENT wing._

[START]
_A chuckle._
**Unknown:** Brilliant, the gas has run out. Now, I do believe the 7 of you can hear me, yes? Through the intercom, yes.
**Unknown:** That's good, get used to your surroundings. Each of you, alone in a locked room. Door won't open, Gardner. No matter how much you hit it. Better to save your energy.
**Unknown:** "Who the fuck" indeed, Teckler. My name is lost to time, but my constituents call me The Engineer. I work for - or with - the Chaos Insurgency. Hah, yes, that Insurgency. I know you've met us before, Mr. ██████. Gardner too. The rest of you… just through word of mouth.
**The Engineer:** Your Site-Gamma was an easy seize. The confidentiality didn't do anything for you, and the lack of staff… it was a wonderful gift for us
**The Engineer:** Let me lay out the rules for you. You're going to be playing a little game, for us, the Insurgency.
**The Engineer:** It's simple. A classic fight to the death.
**The Engineer:** Only one of you can come out of this place alive. Between the cramped walls, steel pillars, and shells of a stronger Foundation, blood will be spilled. For your freedom, you must destroy your coworkers. Your friends. Your enemies, perhaps.
**The Engineer:** Of course, this could go on forever if we let it. Site-Gamma is expansive. Then again, Site-Gamma is also designed perfectly in a series of rings.
**The Engineer:** When we see fit, the farthest ring of the perimeter will close. This is a warning. Don't try to hide out the entire war, until your two enemies end each other. Fight for your life, or it will end in an infernal storm.
**The Engineer:** I can see you don't think I'm serious. I can see the doubt in your eyes. Feel free to doubt. We already got you this far.
**The Engineer:** A final note, before I let you go off and play. There are weapons and items scattered all across the Site for your slaughter. Nothing too powerful, of course, but enough.
**The Engineer:** Don't try to call your friends — your phones are gone. Don't try and beg for help — nobody will respond. Now go on. The doors are unlocked.
**The Engineer:** I want to see bodies dropping.

[BEGIN]
_Murph Teckler can be seen searching through the many cabinets inside the habitation room, standing on a small stool. Multiple office tools have been thrown around the room. There is a knock on the door. Teckler freezes immediately and starts to slowly lower himself from the stool._
**Unknown:** Anyone in there?
_Teckler is startled by the voice and falls off the stool, slamming into the ground. Another knock at the door. The voice identified as John Gardner._
**J. Gardner:** I can hear you sneaking around in there. Come out with your weapons, whatever the hell they are, laid down.
_Teckler pauses for a second before standing up._
**M. Teckler:** Or what?
_Gardner sighs._
**J. Gardner:** Thank god, it's just you.
**M. Teckler:** Excuse me?
**J. Gardner:** Thought I'd have to actually play this stupid game.
**M. Teckler:** What the hell does that mean? And how do you know I'm not going to-
_Teckler takes a step back and slips on a sheet of paper thrown on the floor behind him. While laying on his side, he reads the paper. His eyebrows raise in surprise before looking back at the door._
**M. Teckler:** Fine. You gonna kill me?
**J. Gardner:** Not planning on it. Be like killing lame cattle, and I'm not in the business of killing innocents.
**M. Teckler:** Neither am I. This whole thing is fucking stupid, anyway.
**J. Gardner:** Not scared?
_Teckler stands up and dusts himself off. He walks over and opens the door._
**M. Teckler:** Oh, no, to death. But I'm loyal enough to the Foundation not to play into this stupid shit.
**J. Gardner:** Damn straight, soldier. Let's go find some others.
_Both men walk away from view._

_Petra Baldwin sits on the floor in the middle of the habitation room. There is a revolver in her hand and several flipped-over boxes around the perimeter. She is crying as she stares at the ceiling. There is a knock on the door. Baldwin raises her weapon._
**P. Baldwin:** Get the hell away from that door.
**Unknown:** Oh, Petra, that you?
_Voice identified as Anton Radu. Baldwin lowers the gun, placing it on the ground, and sighs, wiping the tears from her face._
**P. Baldwin:** Yeah. Who's asking over there?
**A. Radu:** Ah, uh, yeah. Dr. Radu- _Anton_ Radu. The archaeologist from earlier. Thanks for sticking up, by the way.
**P. Baldwin:** Hi Anton. No problem.
_Silence._
**P. Baldwin:** So, you looking to kill me?
_Radu gasps._
**A. Radu:** Of course not. They didn't even give me any weapons to begin with anyway. Plus, I'm just an archaeologist, remember?
_Baldwin laughs._
**P. Baldwin:** Sure do.
**A. Radu:** I'd rather not have you kill me either, with the gun you just placed on the ground.
**P. Baldwin:** On the ground for a reason, archaeologist. Any other plans to get out of here?
**A. Radu:** Um. Not right now, other than avoiding the murder part of this game. Seriously freaky. I was thinking of looking around to find the people willing to work together. Want to get out of that room?
_Baldwin stands up and places the firearm back in her pocket. She grabs another from atop a shelf with the same hand and walks to open the door._
**P. Baldwin:** I was thinking the same thing. Here-
_Baldwin places the second firearm in Radu's hand. He sharply inhales, before pocketing it._
**P. Baldwin:** Good to have, just in case.
_Both walk out of view._

[BEGIN]
_Two habitation room doors open. On the left, Director Iovanius Neer steps out. He is sweating and looks around nervously._
**I. Neer:** Nobody here yet, it seems.
_He notices the other open door and steps over, before stopping as Ryoto Hishikaku steps out. Hishikaku is holding a small wooden baseball bat._
**I. Neer:** Oh, good. Someone intelligent.
**R. Hishikaku:** Sure.
**I. Neer:** I was starting to get worried about this whole situation.
_Neer begins pacing around the hall. Hishikaku watches. His breathing becomes heavy._
**I. Neer:** I mean, logically, most of us likely wouldn't kill someone. Assuming it's the same 7 as before, minus Ethel. Ethel would be a good asset, actually.
**R. Hishikaku:** Hm.
**I. Neer:** But that Gardner fellow, and the spy? Very aggressive types back during the orientation. I wouldn't be surprised if they went along with this silly game.
_Neer leans against the wall and raises his head to sigh. He stares at the fluorescent lights on the ceiling._
**I. Neer:** No doubt we'll be able to come out of this if we put our heads together, right Ryoto? For a battle royale, the Insurgency seems pretty disconnected from the whole operation.
_Hishikaku shifts the bat around in his hands._
**I. Neer:** Something doesn't seem right about this place anyway. I know we're still in Site-Gamma, but it doesn't really _feel_ like Site-Gamma.
_Neer looks over to Hishikaku._
**I. Neer:** Y'know?
_Neer notices the bat in Hishikaku's hand._
**I. Neer:** Uh. A bat?
**R. Hishikaku:** Primitive.
**I. Neer:** Yeah, I was thinking. Don't think that can break the walls in this stainless steel facility, but I do appreciate the sentiment.
**R. Hishikaku:** You and I have very different ideas about the sentiment.
**I. Neer:** What?
**R. Hishikaku:** Apologies, Director. They made the rules pretty clear.
_Hishikaku pushes up his glasses, then swings that bat at Neer. The bat makes contact with his chest before breaking into two parts. Neer falls onto his back and Hishikaku discards the broken end in his hand._
**I. Neer:** What the FUCK are you doing?
**R. Hishikaku:** Getting myself out of here.
_Hishikaku walks over and leans over, landing fists into Neer's face. Neer attempts to resist but is held down by Hishikaku's stamped foot on his chest. Eventually, Neer's body goes limp. Hishikaku stands up and walks away, blood dripping behind him._

### HUMAN RESOURCES STAFF REPORT

**STAFF IN QUESTION (Tenure):** IOVANIUS K. NEER (22 Years)  
**EMPLOYED AS:** Level 4 Site Director  
**CURRENT LOCATION:** Site-18
If you asked for a definition of eloquence and leadership, most of the Foundation who knows him would probably point toward Iovanius Neer. He's not a Foundation baby by birth — Parents were eventual defectors from the Serpent's Hand. Iovanius, or Ivy as his coworkers have taken to calling him (as will this report, for the sake of being succinct), didn't get the thaumaturgy though. Nor did he get the wonders of the library. He got dirt and rations, but that makes it more impressive to watch him rise like he did.
Site-18 has always been a tricky Site to manage. Shoved number-wise between the Foundation's greatest accomplishment and the ongoing biggest mistake, people often forget about 18, despite the facility being one of our largest. Directors in the past have done their best to try and fight the under-budgeting and take the reins of such a disorganized place. But Ivy was the first to do it right. He single-handedly took 18 from a cluttered mess to a place of utmost efficiency — and unlike some other facilities, the efficiency didn't come at the cost of humanity.
A strong leader, an intelligent mind, a caring coworker, and someone loyal to the Foundation for the reciprocal benefits given between him and us. Iovanius Neer is probably the most qualified for PROJECT ROYALE — although the sort of archetype given by him is filled, and he's perceived as a valuable asset in his position. So we'll see.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

**VIDEO LOG** (CENTREMOST RESEARCH LAB)

[BEGIN]
_The north door to the lab slowly opens. John Gardner and Murph Teckler walk through, Gardner toting a large revolver. They look around before the east door opens as well. Raising their weapons, they lower upon seeing Anton Radu and Petra Baldwin walking through._
**J. Gardner:** Welcome back.
**P. Baldwin:** Never left. Are you two looking to join the game?
**M. Teckler:** Not particularly. You?
**A. Radu:** Nope.
_Suddenly, the south door to the lab slams open. Ryoto Hisikaku walks through, wiping his beard as he does. Above him, B. ██████ drops down from the ceiling on the west side. All personnel take a step back after noticing each other._
**A. Radu:** Oh, good, we're all-
_Radu notices the blood on Hishikaku's hand._
**A. Radu:** Who's… where's Iovanius?
_Hishikaku doesn't respond._
**A. Radu:** Ryoto- did you-
**R. Hishikaku:** Guess.
_Gardner, Baldwin and ██████ raise their weapons, although Baldwin is nervously shaking. Hishikaku stands underneath a flickering light at the south end of the room. There is blood dripping down his hand into a puddle on the floor. He laughs. Gardner changes the aim of his weapon to Hishikaku._
**J. Gardner:** You motherfucker.
**M. Teckler:** Can't believe you're going along with this, you creepy-
**R. Hishikaku:** Save the expletives. I don't see what the major issue is.
**P. Baldwin:** You don't see the _issue_? You… you slaughtered a member of the Foundation! A Site Director!
**R. Hishikaku:** And?
**A. Radu:** Neer… he- he was a good man.
**P. Baldwin:** Knew him?
**A. Radu:** Yeah, I used to be posted at… 18. A few years ago.
_Hishikaku raises his blood-soaked hand. The others counter._
**R. Hishikaku:** Iovanius was a cowardly man. His first thought, after hearing what we heard, was trying to work collaboratively.
**J. Gardner:** No shit, psycho. We all wanna get out of here.
**R. Hishikaku:** Funny you should say, because the Engineer made it quite evident how we can leave this place. If you were listening to the rules of the game, instead of, I don't know, picking your nose?
**J. Gardner:** Excuse me?
**R. Hishikaku:** The rest of you can continue as you want, but I don't intend to stay here for long. If the voice over the loudspeaker has given me an out, I will take that out with full force.
**B. ██████:** And if we kill you first?
**R. Hishikaku:** So be it then. That's the rules of the game, after all. Keep in mind, though, only one of us can win either way, so collaboration is just going to break your hearts eventually.
**M. Teckler:** Why do you talk like that?
**R. Hishikaku:** What's that? Does the demoted clown want to speak?
**M. Teckler:** I- listen, you shit-mouthed-
_Hishikaku reaches into his pocket and pulls out a small revolver. The other armed personnel step back. He points it at Teckler._
**R. Hishikaku:** Shut up.
_Silence. Teckler begins to hyperventilate._
**A. Radu:** So… what then?
**R. Hishikaku:** A fight, archaeologist. A fight I suggest you leave the room for, seeing as your allies aren't making it out alive.
**J. Gardner:** Bull-fucking shit, you're one man versus-
_██████ changes the direction of his gun towards Gardner._
**B. ██████:** 2 on 2. A little more fair, don't you think?
**P. Baldwin:** Bastard.
_██████ begins shuffling over to stand beside Hishikaku._
**B. ██████:** What can I say? His style intrigues me.
**A. Radu:** So you're going to side with the crazy person?
**B. ██████:** Oh, kid, we're all a little bit crazy. How've you stayed with the Foundation for this long and not realized it?
**A. Radu:** There- There has to be another way out of this, we don't need to be fighting. We all want to get out of here alive, right?
**R. Hishikaku:** Exactly — and I will.
**A. Radu:** But you've got guns pointed at guns. No matter who shoots first, your reaction times will shoot back anyway. Then all that's left is me and Teckler.
_██████ and Hishikaku look at each other, then back to Radu._
**B. ██████:** You sure?
**A. Radu:** How could you be with the Foundation for this long and not realize it?
**J. Gardner:** Fuck all this fancy talk, you two ain't coming out of this as a team.
_The intercom system turns on._
**J. Gardner:** The hell did I say?
**The Engineer:** Nothing at all, John. But you all did remind me of something — something important indeed.
**A. Radu:** What?
**The Engineer:** There _is_ another option.
**R. Hishikaku:** Go on.
**The Engineer:** The Insurgency, obviously, yes, enjoys this standoff. Like ants on a farm, fighting over an impossible queen. But good ants deserve some food from time to time, don't they? Especially if they can pull their weight.
**J. Gardner:** What in the fucking 7th circle are you talking about?
**The Engineer:** An offer, John. To all of you. You're all level 4 personnel — a fortunate benefit to this conquest.
**P. Baldwin:** So?
**M. Teckler:** We are?
**The Engineer:** That means you know many of the Foundation's secrets. Not to Overseer levels, yes, but something. That information is your key out of here.
**A. Radu:** You can't possibly mean-
**J. Gardner:** Defect.
_The room goes silent. All of the personnel look at each other with worried expressions. Hishikaku is deep in thought._
**The Engineer:** Such a cruel word, John. But yes. It's a very simple process. You hand over everything you can about the Foundation, and you'll be freed from this cage. Given safe passage, courtesy of the Insurgency.
**A. Radu:** But that's- The Foundation could find you anywhere, why would we ever take that?
**The Engineer:** The Foundation, the sickly creature it is, is no god. It cannot see all. There are places and protective measures at our disposal to keep a "defector", as it's so offensively called, safe.
**The Engineer:** An efficient quid pro quo.
_The personnel are all silent. Baldwin lowers her weapon._
**M. Teckler:** Fuck you.
**J. Gardner:** Over my dead body.
**R. Hishikaku:** I accept.
_Everyone looks at Hishikaku. He grins._
**J. Gardner:** Traitor.
**R. Hishikaku:** It was your little group of heroes that wanted a different way out, right?
**A. Radu:** You're going to betray the Foundation, all for this. You're not even going to try?
**R. Hishikaku:** What use is "trying" when the path out is right ahead?
_Silence._
**R. Hishikaku:** That's what I thought. Engineer, I accept your offer. Anything I know, it's yours.
**The Engineer:** I knew you'd be interested in seeing reason.
_A single Insurgency Agent enters the room and places their hand on Hishikaku's shoulder._
**The Engineer:** This one will take you out. See you in the plenty and free world, Hishikaku. Rid of the Foundation.
**R. Hishikaku:** Works for me.
_Intercom system turns off. The camera system experiences a visual glitch. Upon returning, Hishikaku and the Insurgent are gone. The other personnel step back cautiously and look around._
**M. Teckler:** Where the hell did he go?
**P. Baldwin:** Doesn't matter, the prick is gone now.
_Intercom system turns back on. The sounds of a struggle can be heard. Someone taps on the microphone._
**The Engineer:** Lovely, back to you all.
**A. Radu:** What- what's that in the background?
**The Engineer:** Nothing at all. Please return to the-
_A slamming noise._
**Hishikaku (over the intercom):** No, no no no, you- you're- you're nothing more than a goddamn ARTIF-
_Gunshot. The intercom system turns off. The rest of the personnel stand in silence and surprise. ██████ looks at the group before lowering his rifle._
**B. ██████:** Well.
_Gardner points his weapon at ██████'s head._
**B. ██████:** Hey, hey now, I lowered mine, you lower yours.
**J. Gardner:** Not so fast, gnat. You were gonna work with the traitor.
**B. ██████:** And the traitor betrayed us, so we're all good now.
**P. Baldwin:** That's not how it works.
**B. ██████:** Oh please, honey, that's exactly how it works. Trust me, you bulkheads and blockheads couldn't get out of here with the key in hand. I'm a spy — you need me.
_While he is talking, ██████ is slowly reaching into his left pocket. Only Radu notices._
**J. Gardner:** And why is that?
**B. ██████:** Simple. Escape plans.
_██████ pulls out a small metal bauble from his pocket. Radu grabs Gardner and Baldwin and pushes them to the side in time, as the bauble is thrown towards their side of the room and shatters against the wall. Smog begins flowing out of the cracked pieces._
**P. Baldwin:** More of this stuff?
_The smog fills the room, obscuring the video feed._
**J. Gardner:** Not if I can help it.
_The sounds of the north doors opening can be heard, as well as the footsteps of Gardner. Eventually, the smog fades away. The room is empty._

**STAFF IN QUESTION (Tenure):** RYOTO HISHIKAKU (30 Years)  
**EMPLOYED AS:** Level 4 Director of Analogue Intelligence  
**CURRENT LOCATION:** Site-17
Cold. Calculating. Smarter than we'd like to give credit for, given the first 2. That's the apt description of the AIC that we employ at the Foundation. The interesting ones, the quirky ones, are a rarity. Kind of the opposite of our employees. Most are quirky — Hishikaku is like the digital entities he designs.
Currently, he's the head of Analogue Intelligence. It's a strange and distinct difference between his old job as co-Director of the Artificial Intelligence Department, a job he lost due to quite several ethics violations against him. There's the issue with people like Hishikaku; he's incredibly qualified at his job. He's responsible for the current understanding we have of digital (or analog, whatever that entails) intelligence, and he'd be an insanely respected figure in the Foundation if he just wasn't so cruel to his coworkers. Days off are lacking, and emotions rarely show beyond the negatives.
When we write about ethics issues, we're talking about really big ethics issues. Hishikaku's been suspected of betraying the Foundation for our less-moral enemies in at least 2 different instances. He's been cleared each time, but there's still the lingering wonder if he's still loyal to what's better: The Foundation.
PROJECT ROYALE will be an excellent test of this character.

_██████ reaches into his pocket and pulls out a small metal cuff link, which has been twisted into a point. After a few minutes, he is able to open the door to the habitation unit. The room is lit inside._
**B. ██████:** Finally. See ya, suckers.
_██████ enters the room and can no longer be seen. Suddenly, the lights inside the habitation unit turn purple. The doors to all other habitation units open and reveal the same purple light. After the sounds of some electrical crackling, screams resembling the voice of ██████ are heard. The lightning stops. Footsteps approach. A. Radu walks into view. His eyes widen as he looks into the rooms._
**A. Radu:** Huh?
_Radu notices the room where ██████ entered. He screams. The intercom system turns on._
**The Engineer:** The storm has arrived. The outer perimeter is no longer available.

### HUMAN RESOURCES STAFF REPORT

**STAFF IN QUESTION (Tenure):** BARRY S. ██████ (?? Years)  
**EMPLOYED AS:** Level 4 Espionage Agent  
**CURRENT LOCATION:** Varies.
The identity of ██████ is something completely lost to us. That's no hyperbole. All we know about "Barry" (as he calls himself) is that he was part of an old Foundation espionage initiative to reduce the risk when it came to our spies getting captured. Everything about ██████ was erased from his mind, and likely anyone that knew him before that. He agreed to it — allegedly — but it still does place him at odds with the more modern "just be better at getting out of it" mentality. More humane. Kind of.
He's certainly an interesting character. The lack of identity led to him forming his own, and the result is very… pataphysics calls him "narratively convenient". A faux-charmer with a loud mouth that can slither out of situations like the sleaze-ball they are. That kind of spy. At the very least, ██████ is great at his job. Supposedly. It's always difficult to document these constant moving forces within the Foundation — how do you "Human Resources" someone who lost most of what made them human?
He's a very unique case for PROJECT ROYALE. He's not exactly in the same vein of intelligence as some other candidates, but he makes up for it in the specialization. Plus, the Foundation is looking to reduce active war efforts and go back to subtle movements. Nothing more subtle than a spy.

[BEGIN]
_John Gardner and Murph Teckler are standing in the hall. Teckler looks worried, and Gardner is holding his weapon ready. This continues for 5 minutes before footsteps can be heard from down the hall. Both men look over to see Anton Radu running towards them, arms flailing to the sides as he struggles to keep his balance. Gardner lowers his weapon._
**J. Gardner:** Just him. Great.
_Radu reaches the two men and leans on the wall, exhausted. He is shaking._
**M. Teckler:** So. What the fuck?
**J. Gardner:** You know anything about what that last message was?
_Radu raises his hand and finishes catching his breath._
**A. Radu:** He, uh. He's gone. The Engineer wasn't kidding about the whole storm thing, he… his body was…
_Radu begins clenching his stomach and leans against the wall. Concerned, Gardner places his hand on Radu's shoulder._
**J. Gardner:** Take it easy, soldier. Don't need to know the details.
_Radu vomits on the floor. The video feed experiences a visual glitch. Upon returning, there is no vomit on the floor. Teckler shakes his head._
**M. Teckler:** Terrific. Directors gone, the robot king sacrificed himself to… something. Now the guy who specialized in escape plans is dead.
**J. Gardner:** Real effective escape plan, I guess.
**M. Teckler:** Got him out of here.
_Radu stands up and dusts off his pants. He gives Gardner a nod of appreciation before looking around the hall._
**A. Radu:** Where's Petra?
**J. Gardner:** Off looking, just like you were. Though after that message, she's probably on her way back now.
**M. Teckler:** Hope not.
**A. Radu:** What?
**J. Gardner:** Excuse me?
**M. Teckler:** I don't like her vibe. The moment BLACKBOX went missing, she's been consistently more jittery and paranoid. It's freaking me the hell out.
**A. Radu:** Can you blame her?
**M. Teckler:** Uh, yeah? The rest of us can hide our fear, or better yet, just deal with it. I hope you know I'm ready to take drastic measures if she changes course on us.
_Gardner steps towards Teckler, whose eyes widen with fear. Gardner broadens his shoulders as his shadow falls over Teckler._
**J. Gardner:** Same goes for you, dillweed. She's probably got a family to worry about, something I imagine you don't have. All in this together, remember?
**M. Teckler:** Fucking- fine. Sorry.
**A. Radu:** Hey, guys, let's stay focused. All in this together, right? No need for unnecessary threats.
_Gardner backs off. Teckler sighs in relief._
**A. Radu:** Let's focus on finding Petra and getting the hell out of-
_Footsteps start approaching from the other end of the hall. Petra Baldwin is walking to the group. She waves to the group, with a sheet of paper in her right hand._
**P. Baldwin:** You're not going to believe what I found.
**M. Teckler (under his breath):** Stability?
_Gardner kicks Teckler._
**J. Gardner:** Looks like a sheet of paper to me.
**P. Baldwin:** Not any old sheet of paper.
_Baldwin raises the sheet of paper for Gardner and Radu to see. It is a map of Site-Gamma's floorplan._
**A. Radu:** A map.
**J. Gardner:** Great job, soldier.
**M. Teckler:** A map? Like of the facility?
**P. Baldwin:** Exactly.
**J. Gardner:** So, any exits marked on there?
**P. Baldwin:** No, unfortunately, but something even better.
_Baldwin points at the central room on the map, labeled "SCP-7209 HOLDING"._
**P. Baldwin:** I think I know what we can use to get out of here.

[BEGIN]
_John Gardner, Petra Baldwin, Murph Teckler, and Anton Radu are in the antechamber surrounding the labeled SCP-7209 containment chamber. The former 3 are attempting to pry open the steel door on the front, using a rusted crowbar. Radu is standing by a small input screen next to the chamber. The three trying to pry open the door are struggling._
**M. Teckler:** What the hell do they make these things out of?
**J. Gardner:** Fucking solid steel, what do you think?
**P. Baldwin:** Shut up and keep pulling!
_Radu continues to tap on the screen. He stops and looks at it quizzically. Gardner looks over at him._
**J. Gardner:** Problem?
**A. Radu:** Uh. Not exactly. It's just asking for a passphrase, for some reason. This UI is super basic and it's been smooth sailing until now…?
**M. Teckler:** Passphrase? Like-
**M. Teckler and A. Radu:** "Does the Black Moon howl?"
_Silence. Gardner, Teckler, and Baldwin stop pulling on the door._
**P. Baldwin:** Huh.
**A. Radu:** Never heard that one before.
_Continued silence. Gardner shakes his head._
**J. Gardner:** Fuck this, I know y'all have response codes.
**M. Teckler:** I don't know _what_ you're talking about.
**P. Baldwin:** Never heard it before in my…
**J. Gardner:** You're the RAISA person. You read a thousand of those documents.
_All four of them go silent again for a minute, looking around nervously. Radu looks at the video recording system. The video feed experiences a visual glitch. Upon returning, nothing has changed. Baldwin sighs._
**P. Baldwin:** Okay, fine.
**M. Teckler:** Yeah, yeah, alright.
**A. Radu:** …we all have codes?
**J. Gardner:** We're all level 4, it's bound to have come up before.
**M. Teckler:** Hope I don't get killed for this.
**J. Gardner:** Whatever. We all know about it anyway, and the codes get switched every single day.
**M. Teckler:** So we're not betraying the Foundation?
**J. Gardner:** No. Probably not.
**A. Radu:** Okay, mine didn't work in this thing anyway. John?
**J. Gardner:** "When the strong and mighty slit the ancient's throat."
_Radu types on the screen. There is an error noise. Radu shakes his head._
**A. Radu:** Nope. Petra?
**P. Baldwin:** "If we get ourselves in order."
_Radu types on the screen. A small bell-dinging noise is made. He gives the rest of the group a thumbs up, and they go back to pulling on the door._
**A. Radu:** Let's see what we're getting into.

**Description:** SCP-7209 is a 1 x 3 x 1 large[5](javascript:;) quartz crystal which possesses some kind of ontological instability.
SCP-7209 is something something very dangerous[6](javascript:;)[7](javascript:;)

_Radu looks up from the screen and looks towards the others. The steel door to SCP-7209's containment chamber is finally pulled open. Baldwin and Teckler fall back on the ground and cheer with Gardner as the dust inside the chamber flows out._
**A. Radu:** Uh. Guys?
_The other three ignore Radu and pull themselves up, patting each other on the back._
**P. Baldwin:** Finally, there's gonna be a way out of this freaky place.
_M. Teckler tries to speak but coughs on the dust. Gardner slaps him on the back._
**J. Gardner:** Amen sister! Home free, right goddamn before us.
**A. Radu:** Guys?
**P. Baldwin:** My kids, man… god, I hope they're alright.
**J. Gardner:** Foundation puts families of the endangered under special protection, in circumstances like this. You'll see 'em soon.
**P. Baldwin:** If anything happened to them, I don't know what I'd do.
**A. Radu (yelling):** Guys!
**P. Baldwin:** Oh, sorry, yeah Anton?
**J. Gardner:** You see what our ticket out of here is?
**A. Radu:** Look.
_The dust from the chamber settles. There is a metal podium in the center of the chamber, with a fluorescent ring light in the ceiling. Atop the podium is a 20 x 20 x 20 cm crystal, bearing resemblance to quartz. The personnel are silent._
**M. Teckler:** Well. Interesting. A rock.
**P. Baldwin:** A… rock.
**J. Gardner:** You're fucking kidding.
_Baldwin walks over to the supposed SCP-7209. Her hands are shaking and she has a look of desperation on her face._
**P. Baldwin:** Well, I'm sure this is- This is fine, it was important enough to be kept here. They built a whole facility just for one anomaly.
_Baldwin starts frantically examining the object, careful to not make contact. Gardner places his head in his hands and sighs. Teckler sits on the ground and leans against the steel walls of the antechamber._
**P. Baldwin:** It has to do something. Anton, Anton, you read the file, what's the deal with this thing?
_Radu is silent. He looks down at the floor._
**P. Baldwin:** Anton, I- we need this thing to get out of here. What the hell does the rock do?
_Radu sighs. Tears are welling in Baldwin's eyes._
**A. Radu:** It… it doesn't do anything.
_Gardner and Teckler wince. Baldwin begins to slowly step towards Radu. There are more tears in her eyes._
**P. Baldwin:** The fuck are you talking about? It's- It's SCP-7209, that rock is the whole reason we're here! What does it _do_?
_Baldwin keeps stepping forward. Gardner takes a step back while Teckler shuffles closer to the antechamber doorway._
**A. Radu:** I told you, it doesn't do anything. The document- it was just a placeholder or something. I think SCP-7209 was too? The document wasn't even finished when I got to it, there's no proper description at all beyond-
_Radu points at the supposed SCP-7209._
**A. Radu:** Beyond that. It doesn't even have anomalous properties, I don't think. Keter class but… it said something about "the show"? We're in a game, right? Did the Insurgency plant this?
_Baldwin takes another step. She is no longer standing in the antechamber, and she slowly starts reaching toward her pocket. Gardner increases the grip on the firearm he's holding._
**P. Baldwin:** I don't care about whatever your theory is, Anton, I just- I just need this to do anything. You're a goddamn archaeologist, can't you- I don't know, do something?
**A. Radu:** That's not what archaeology is, I don't deal with just crystals or whatever. It's just a rock, Petra, I'm sorry.
_The room goes silent. Baldwin starts to hyperventilate and reaches deeper into her pocket. Gardner takes another step back. Teckler is now seated in the doorway to the antechamber. Radu places his hand in his lab coat pocket. Baldwin begins to sob._
**P. Baldwin:** God fucking damn it, man.
**A. Radu:** I'm sorry Petra, but there's another way out of-
**P. Baldwin:** Another way out? What, is Big and Buff going to run into the walls until they fall over? Teckler slithering out like the worm he is? This was our last fucking shot, Anton, and it's- it's over.
**J. Gardner:** Soldier, it ain't over 'till it's over. Now, I suggest you don't do what I think you're about to, because-
**P. Baldwin:** My kids, Anton. I'll never get to see them again. My wife, my coworkers, my friends, everyone I've ever loved. Gone.
**A. Radu:** Don't think like that, Petra, it's not-
**P. Baldwin:** You have family, archaeologist?
_Radu steps back. His hand grasps something inside his lab coat pocket._
**A. Radu:** No.
**P. Baldwin:** Then you don't understand what it's like. None of you do.
**J. Gardner:** What?
_Suddenly, Baldwin screams and pulls the revolver out of her pocket, running towards Radu and pointing at his head. Gardner attempts to shoot at her, but his firearm jams. As Baldwin runs forward, Radu pulls out his revolver. His hands are shaking. He looks at Baldwin and Gardner. Gardner is trying to unjam the firearm, and Teckler has already run away from the antechamber. With a tear welling in his eye, Radu pulls out the revolver Baldwin gave him initially and fires two shots. One makes contact with Baldwin's chest, terminating her instantly. The other makes contact with the supposed SCP-7209. The crystal shatters. The video feed experiences a visual glitch. Upon returning, only half the crystal shards are remaining on the ground. Baldwin's body is gone. Gardener and Radu breathe heavily from exhaustion, before sitting on the ground and dropping their weapons. They look at each other. Tears begin to well in Radu's eyes. Teckler walks back into the room slowly and sits next to Radu. He winces upon noticing the gun next to Radu. Radu leans his head back and begins to cry._

### HUMAN RESOURCES STAFF REPORT

**STAFF IN QUESTION (Tenure):** PETRA M. BALDWIN (11 Years)  
**EMPLOYED AS:** Level 4 RAISA Deputy Chief  
**CURRENT LOCATION:** Site-07
RAISA is a very different environment from the rest of the Foundation. Kind of similar to us in Human Resources, you're not dealing with active anomalies or research — unless it's an infoallergenic anomaly, in which case, that's a full day of chaos. RAISA is about composure, about writing and containing your thoughts as you go to archive hundreds of years of paperwork. It's also an old department. Rumors say they were the third to come, after the Overseers and Ethics Committee. Of course, that's just speculation from the mythologists among us. The point is, the people are old. So a Level 4 Deputy Chief is unexpected.
Petra is a go-getter. She's responsible. She cares about her coworkers, and even more about the people she handles the archival of. She cares a lot about her family — 2 children — and hates spending time away from them. But she has a dedication to the Foundation, just like her mother beforehand. 33 years old, and 11 years as one of RAISA's best, has made her the leader of the modern department. Second only to Maria Jones, of course.
Nobody likes moving her so far away from her family so an extended period, but we know she'll do it. The stress of the distance might even help. She's the RAISA candidate for PROJECT ROYALE. After all, not like we can throw Maria Jones away like that, right?

_Teckler, Radu, and Gardner enter the east-wing weapon storage room. The furniture, including the individual lockers, has been thrown around the room. There are ammunition and firearms on the ground. The three look around before beginning to collect items._
**J. Gardner:** Grab everything you can. We wanna blast out of this place, we'll need all the firepower we can get.
**M. Teckler:** What about this?
_Teckler attempts to lift a heavy-duty barricade shield and drops it. Gardner walks over and picks it up with ease, throwing it over his back._
**J. Gardner:** Works for me.
_Radu looks around the room. He places his hands in his lab coat pockets and sits down. Teckler and Gardner notice._
**J. Gardner:** Hey, soldier, you good?
**M. Teckler:** What's got you all fucked up in the head?
_Gardner slaps the back of Teckler's head._
**A. Radu:** It's just… I can't stop thinking about Petra.
_Gardner sighs._
**J. Gardner:** Kid, I know what it's like. First kill, right?
**A. Radu:** Uh. Yeah.
**J. Gardner:** Could tell from the look in your eyes. Feels like a mix of emotions. But you did the right thing.
**M. Teckler:** She was going to get us all killed, you included.
**J. Gardner:** Exactly. Plus, live easy with the thought that you don't have to kill many more people in the field of archaeology, once we're out of here.
_Radu chuckles._
**A. Radu:** Guess that's true.
_Gardner stands up._
**J. Gardner:** So, let's keep going. Can't let our emotions distract us, not right now. Save tears for once you're off the battlefield, or you'll get hurt.
_Radu sighs and stands up._
**A. Radu:** Yeah. Okay. Thanks.
**M. Teckler:** Let's kill this fucking engineer.
_Intercom system turns on. All three brace themselves with the weapons in their hands._
**The Engineer:** So. Do you want to object? Do you think there's another way out of this place?
**M. Teckler:** My god, do you ever shut up?
**The Engineer:** Perhaps another incentive to close inwards is required.
_3 Insurgency agents run through the doorway in front of Radu, Teckler, and Gardner. All are armed and wear tactical gear, including full-face masks bearing the Chaos Insurgency Insignia._
**Insurgent 1:** Alright, Feds, hands behind your head!
**Insurgent 2:** Yeah, hands, now!
**M. Teckler:** Okay, okay, okay, fine, Jesus Christ.
**J. Gardner:** No.
**Insurgent 3:** What the _fuck_ was that, stocky?
**J. Gardner:** I told you, no.
**Insurgent 1:** Not an option, you stupid-
_Gardner pulls his handgun out of the holster and fires at the head of Insurgent 1, their body falling dead to the ground with a splatter of blood on the wall behind them. He then leaps toward Insurgent 3 and tackles them to the ground. While Insurgent 2 turns to react, Radu pulls out the pistol and points it toward them. Teckler runs towards the door._
**Insurgent 3:** Get the hell off me, you beast!
**J. Gardner:** Fuck you. Radu, please, if you wouldn't mind.
**A. Radu:** Uh, yeah, right, okay. Don't shoot him, asshole.
**Insurgent 2:** Oh, the archaeologist has a gun? Real scary there, kiddo.
**A. Radu:** Excuse me?
_Gardner begins slamming Insurgent 3's neck against the ground and punching their face mask. Insurgent 3 lands a hit on Gardner's nose. A cracking sound is heard Gardner screams. He raises his fists in the air again._
**J. Gardner (between punches):** Let. Us. Out. Of. Here.
_Insurgent 2 raises their gun towards Radu. Radu shakes._
**Insurgent 2:** Well, there goes that confidence then. This'll be fu-
_A rock resembling a fragment of SCP-7209 flies through the doorway and hits Insurgent 2 in the front of their helmet mask. They fall backward while trying to recover themselves and slam the back of their head on a clothes bar in the closet behind them. The sound of a skull cracking can be heard before they fall, blood smearing on the wall behind them. Teckler runs into the room holding the pieces of SCP-7209._
**M. Teckler:** Shit, did that work?
**A. Radu:** That- how did he manage to…
_A. Radu looks at the security camera in the room. Visual glitch._
**J. Gardner:** Welcome back, sissy.
**Insurgent 3:** Goddamn it, I'm gonna fucking kill you, fuckin' Foundation piece of-
_Gardner grabs his revolver and slams the back end into the Insurgent's helmet mask. They slump to the ground and stop moving. Gardner leans back and lets out a tired exhale. Blood drips from the back of the revolver._
**M. Teckler:** Wow.
**J. Gardner:** Well? Who else, you freaky fucking shadow voice? Who else needs to get their ass kicked? Or are we done here?
_Insurgent 3 coughs and starts shallow breathing again. Gardner turns his attention back to them._
**J. Gardner:** And you. I don't know who you are, but I'll find out, and I'll have the entirety of the Foundation's armed forces focused on everyone you hold dear.
**A. Radu:** Okay, John, that's probably enough.
_Gardner ignores Radu._
**J. Gardner:** You, and your insurgency, and everyone else who's out to ruin our lives. It's over, you fucking-
_Gardner takes off the Insurgent's helmet and gasps. The face underneath the helmet is recognized as Chase McDougall, Gardner's second in command within their MTF. Gardner drops the helmet on the ground and leans down putting his hands on the side of McDougall's head. Tears start forming in Gardner's eyes._
**J. Gardner:** Chase?
_McDougall coughs up blood and grins weakly._
**J. Gardner:** No. No no no. You ain't- you're loyal, you would never…
**C. McDougall:** I'm… I'm sorry chief… you put up a good fight, eh?
_Gardner begins speaking through sobs._
**J. Gardner:** Goddamn it Chase, we were Foundation fucking family! Your father, mine, we… why would you-
_McDougall coughs up more blood. Some lands on Gardner's face. Teckler and Radu stand behind Gardner, looking at the blood on the floor around them._
**J. Gardner:** Soldier, no, you can't do this, you can't- I'm so sorry, Stormchaser, I'm so fucking sorry-
_McDougall slowly raises his hand and places it on Gardner's shoulder. Teckler flinches._
**J. Gardner:** Why… why the hell would you ever…
_Gardner's tears start falling into the blood on McDougall's body. Tears form in McDougall's eyes._
**C. McDougall:** They… they had my wife, Chief… daughter too. I couldn't- I couldn't let them…
_McDougall's eyes begin to flutter shut. Gardner starts to hyperventilate._
**J. Gardner:** Don't you start dying on me, soldier- you can't start dying on me now. You can't go, we- I need you, Stormchaser, I need you to stay with me!
**C. McDougall:** I'm so sorry, John.
_McDougall falls limp. Gardner, Teckler, and Radu remain silent. Tears flow down Gardner's face. Teckler and Radu look at each other._
**J. Gardner:** No… that's…
_Suddenly, Gardner's eyes widen. Marching can be heard approaching the storage room. Teckler and Radu run to the sides of the doorway. Gardner raises his head._
**J. Gardner:** You didn't have a wife. It was a cover we told them so we could-
_7 Insurgents enter the room behind Gardner. All raise their weapons and shoot directly at Gardner's head. Teckler and Radu cover their mouths while hiding behind the thrown-around furniture. The Insurgents stop firing and leave the room, single-file. Gardner's body drops dead on the floor. The video feed experiences a visual glitch. Upon returning, McDougall's body is gone. Radu looks around the room in confusion before the intercom system turns on again._
**The Engineer:** And thus, there were two.

**STAFF IN QUESTION (Tenure):** JOHN. O. GARDNER (41 YEARS)  
**EMPLOYED AS:** Level 4 MTF Captain, MTF Charlie-99 ("Ballistic Boomers")  
**CURRENT LOCATION:** Varies.
John Gardner is a mixed bag. On one hand, the Gardners are Foundation legacy. His family, 6 generations back, have worked here, almost all as MTF Agents. There’s good reason for it too — natural talent is what some people call it. Strong, quick thinkers who can tactically deal with almost any situation thrown at them. John is the most recent and debatably best example of this. Been leading Charlie-99 since his father died, and the “Ballistic Boomers” are no joke. A powerhouse strike team called in for heavy-duty, sometimes military, anomalous combat requires a leader fit high-stress scenarios. John Gardner fits like a leather-back glove.
On the other hand, the stress of being this kind of necessary leader can get to him. He’s become more gruff, more aggressive over the past couple of years. It’s a pattern of behavior that’s unsurprising after the ways his father acted, but it’s led to 3 HR Reports against him for aggravated behavior. His team respects him — he’s a 6’4 powerhouse of a man — but can he call them friends? His closest companion is his second-in-command Chase McDougall. They’ve been best friends since childhood. At least, that’s what we’ve been told.
All and all, John Gardner is the best choice for an agent in PROJECT ROYALE. His skills supersede the emotions — at least, theoretically.

_Anton Radu and Murph Teckler sit next to each other, leaning against the wall. Both have small splatters of blood on their clothes. Teckler releases a heavy exhale, and Radu wipes tears from his eyes. Teckler coughs._
**M. Teckler:** So.
**A. Radu:** So?
**M. Teckler:** Just us.
**A. Radu:** Yeah. Yeah, it is.
**M. Teckler:** Just like you told Hishikaku, right?
**A. Radu:** Huh. Yeah, right.
**M. Teckler:** So. Are you ready to duel?
_Radu looks at Teckler with confusion and stands up. He reaches into his lab coat pocket._
**A. Radu:** Excuse me?
**M. Teckler:** Duel. You know. Fight, between two people. That's how most battle royales end anyway.
**A. Radu:** I'm not- what happened to getting out of here together?
_Teckler stands up and laughs._
**M. Teckler:** Please, that was John's whole campaign. Now that the beefcake is gone, what hope do we have of breaking out?
**A. Radu:** That's not… we can still do this, Murph. We can't just give up now.
**M. Teckler:** Goddamn it, we _can_ , Anton. I don't know why you can't seem to realize it, but we _can_. Quite frankly, I think you want to live just as much as I do.
**A. Radu:** Of course I want to, but I also don't want any more blood to be spilled- we had to watch so many people get shot, beaten, crumpled, I… we can't do that. We can't let ourselves fall into that.
**M. Teckler:** Stupid.
_Teckler reaches into his labcoat pocket; it is clearly bloated from carrying shards of SCP-7209._
**A. Radu:** If you were against us the whole time, why didn't you just say that? Tell us the truth and leave us be?
**M. Teckler:** How far would telling the truth have gotten me? John or you or that psycho Petra would've killed me immediately if you knew I just wanted out, or that I worked at Site-37 for reasons, or that I knew what the stupid crystal was gonna be. I mean, sustainability, Anton, don't you get that?
_Radu is silent. He pulls the revolver out of his pocket and points it at Teckler. Teckler raises his hands._
**M. Teckler:** Woah nelly. Thought we weren't dueling.
**A. Radu:** Did you say you knew what SCP-7209 was going to be?
_Teckler takes a step back._
**M. Teckler:** Uh, yeah. It was one of the papers in my spawn room- why is that what you care about?
**A. Radu:** If we had known about that, then- Petra might've lived you sick fuck!
_Teckler takes another 2 steps back. His hands are shaking._
**M. Teckler:** Okay, Anton, let's calm down and consider for a second- LOOK AN INSURGENT!
_Radu looks behind him. Teckler turns around and starts running down the hall. Radu turns back and begins to chase after Teckler, firing an initial shot that barely misses and slams into the steel wall at the end._
**VIDEO LOG** (CONTAINMENT HALL OUTSIDE ANTECHAMBER)
* * *
_Teckler runs around the corner of the hall, narrowly avoiding the gunshot. As he runs down the hall towards the entrance to the antechamber, Radu turns around the corner after him._
**A. Radu:** Goddamn it, Teckler, you fucking traitor!
_Teckler ignores him and keeps running. Upon reaching the entrance to the antechamber, he turns with a swivel and slips on the ground, landing on his stomach. As Radu continues to run towards him, Teckler flips himself on his back and prepares to get up before another gunshot is fired. Teckler stays on the ground and begins to shuffle back as Radu approaches._

**AUDIO LOG**
* * *
[BEGIN]
_Murph Teckler shuffles into the antechamber on his back, crawling backward and nervously shaking. Anton Radu walks forward at him, his revolver pointed at Teckler's head. Neither notice the multiple Insurgency agents standing around the perimeter of the room. Teckler eventually backs up against the outer wall of the chamber. He looks back, gasps, and looks back at Radu. Radu has an expression of anger._
**M. Teckler:** C'mon, man, you don't have to do this.
**A. Radu:** I don't? I thought killing people was the only way out of this, Murph.
**M. Teckler:** That's- I wasn't serious, you know that, I still want to get out of here, just the two of us.
**A. Radu:** Why didn't you tell us about SCP-7209 then? Why didn't you tell us what you knew? Petra, she-
**M. Teckler:** She was fucking unstable, Anton. No matter what went down, whether or not we found the crystal and tore down that door, she would've cracked eventually. Don't be so stupid.
**A. Radu:** Why didn't you tell me then at least? Tell someone? Try to encourage us to, I don't know, go somewhere else. If she was going to burst, why did you lead us to a point where people died?
**M. Teckler:** I didn't- You're being irrational, Radu, c'mon. Give me a chance, I'm not going to-
_Intercom turns on. Two taps on the mic._
**The Engineer:** Well. Isn't this quite a pickle?
**A. Radu:** Great.
**M. Teckler:** No, god, not right now.
**The Engineer:** My fellow insurgents, wouldn't you agree that this particular room is… unfit for a good show?
_The Insurgents around the room all nod at the same time. Radu and Teckler finally notice them and jump in shock. Teckler tries to move away slowly while Radu watches them, but Radu keeps the revolver tracking on his head. Teckler freezes._
**A. Radu:** When did they…?
_Video feed experiences a visual glitch. Upon returning, the central SCP-7209 containment chamber is gone. Teckler falls back and his head lands with a hard slam against the ground. Radu jumps slightly before regaining composure and repointing the gun at Teckler. There is now another layer of Insurgents around the room._
**A. Radu:** What is going _on_?
**M. Teckler:** Where- how- what?
**The Engineer:** Just fixing things for the show, of course.
_Radu stops and sharply exhales. He lowers the firearm and looks at the intercom speaker._
**A. Radu:** What did you just say?
**The Engineer:** Just fixing things for the show of course.
**A. Radu:** The.. the show?
**M. Teckler:** Anton?
**A. Radu:** Where have I heard that before?
**The Engineer:** I don't know what you mean. Now look, Anton, the worm Teckler is right before you.
_Teckler begins hyperventilating and backs himself up to the feet of the Insurgents behind him, jumping upon looking back and seeing their masked face staring back._
**A. Radu:** That… that line. And the bodies. And the paper, and all the weird systems.
**M. Teckler:** Anton? Hello? You're- you're thinking of a way to help us, right?
**A. Radu:** Why isn't Ethel here? Why wasn't the file complete?
**M. Teckler:** Earth to Anton, please, wake the fuck up!
**A. Radu:** And that thing, that thing Hishikaku said before he died.
**The Engineer:** Anton, your freedom, sits right there before you. A way out, and a way to rid your glorious Foundation of the rats and worms like Murph Teckler. Don't you seek victory? Do you not want to find yourself the last man standing?
**The Engineer:** This is the end, Anton. The gun, the one in your hand, is completely loaded. The right amount of shots to end everything. It's you or Teckler. His life, his squirming, pathetic life, it's not worth your own. You know that. He's done nothing but ruin it all, Anton.
_Radu looks around the room. His eyes widen slightly as he realizes something._
**A. Radu:** Oh.
**M. Teckler:** Oh?
**The Engineer:** Or, you come with us. Join the Insurgency. Tell us everything you know - or rather, let us pull it from your brain. Help us rebuild the world, a better one free of the Foundation. A world where we could be kings, Anton.
**The Engineer:** Two options, archaeologist. Which one will it be?
_Radu closes his eyes and deeply inhales. His index finger slowly approached the trigger._
**M. Teckler:** No. No no no, Radu, listen to me, it doesn't-
_Radu raises the gun to face Teckler's head._
**M. Teckler:** Fuck.
**The Engineer:** One click.
_Radu holds still for a moment._
**The Engineer:** Well?
**A. Radu:** Not playing your game.
_Radu points the gun at his own head. Chaos Insurgency agents around the room raise their weapons and begin to approach._
**The Engineer:** You- You can't possibly-
_Radu clicks down on the trigger._

**O5 COUNCIL RECORD**
* * *
[BEGIN]
_The sack on Dr. Radu's head is removed. He is sitting between O5-11 and an empty chair labeled "13". All of the O5 Council are staring directly at him._
**O5-1:** Hello, Anton Radu.
**A. Radu:** …what?
**O5-3:** `HEART RATE SIGNIFICANTLY ABOVE AVERAGE. ARE YOU AFRAID, DR. RADU?`
**O5-6:** The hell he gotta be afraid of? Ain't ever seen an O5 before?
**O5-8:** Most people haven't, actually. Funny statistic.
**O5-7:** How do you gauge that, anyhow?
**O5-8:** Annual census.
**O5-3:** `CORRECT. THE STATISTIC IS APPROXIMATELY 0.08% OF ALL FOUNDATION PERSONNEL HAVE ACTUALLY SEEN-`
_O5-1 places his hand on the glass dome containing O5-3._
**O5-1:** That's quite enough of that, everyone. Dr. Anton Radu, you have been selected as the one true victor within PROJECT ROYALE. As such, you have been immediately promoted to the position of O5-12.
**O5-11:** Surprise!
**O5-6:** Y'ain't much of a fighter, but damn right you proved yourself.
**O5-5:** Oh, what's the codename gonna be?
**O5-4:** "The Archeologist" makes sense, doesn't it?
**O5-8:** Kind of drab. What about "The Normal"? Since he's, you know…
_O5-8 raises their cybernetic arm extensions._
**O5-8:** Not like this.
_O5-13 manifests in the "13" seat._
**O5-13:** Already done before, by my previous.
**O5-5:** If copying isn't allowed, how come 6 gets to be "The American"?
**O5-6:** You questionin' my nation, _Five-head_?
**O5-5:** That's barely even an insult, cowboy.
**O5-1:** All of you, I would like to give Anton here a more positive outlook on the Council before he starts. Please. So stop talking.
**O5-4:** Sorry, boss.
**O5-1:** Right. Anyway. Dr. Anton Radu, do you, with all the power of the Foundation, and swearing the oath of Security, Containment, and Protection, accept this promotion?
**O5-5:** Why do you even ask 'em that, he's obviously going to say-
**A. Radu:** Uh. No?
**O5-5:** -yes. Sorry, what?
**O5-7:** Kid, that's…. No isn't an option.
**O5-8:** First time for everything.
**O5-1:** Dr. Radu, you mean to tell me you decline the promotion to a member of the O5 Council?
**A. Radu:** Yes. Yes, I do. Sorry, I know this is a big deal and everything, but I don't see myself as that kind of… I don't know. I'm not suited towards this? I'm an Archaeologist, I'm not a bureaucrat. Or anomalous, which seems to be… a common theme.
**O5-5:** 6 isn't anomalous. He's just stupid.
**O5-6:** Stupidly PATRIOTIC.
**A. Radu:** But yeah. I don't even know what I did to earn this anyway, all I did was… well, I offed myself in a simulation. That _was_ a simulation, right?
**O5-8:** Correct! State of the art.
**A. Radu:** State-of-the-art simulation, used for… a battle royale.
**O5-4:** I wouldn't think of it like that.
**O5-7:** It kind of was.
**O5-1:** Yes, Dr. Radu, the method we used to promote you was controversial, but-
**A. Radu:** Controversial? You made us… you told us to kill each other! I had to watch good people, good coworkers, get slaughtered!
**O5-13:** Death comes for us all, Radu.
**O5-5:** Not like any of it was real, right?
**O5-3:** `SIMULATION: noun, imitation of a situation or process.`
**A. Radu:** It doesn't matter that it wasn't real, none of them knew that. Maybe John and Teckler, but everyone else… I mean, Petra, what happened to her… they're going to carry those memories forever now.
_The room goes silent. O5-10 raises their hand._
**O5-10:** They won't.
**A. Radu:** What?
**O5-10:** It's all gone.
**A. Radu:** You… how is that ethical?
**O5-6:** Who the hell said anything about ethics?
**O5-1:** Listen, Anton, I think both you and I can agree that it would be hell for the rest of their lives if they could remember PROJECT ROYALE. What we did makes natural sense.
**O5-4:** Foundation policy, if you will.
O5-1: Now, let me make it clear to you: you _are_ going to become O5-12. It's not an offer, it's an order. You displayed all the traits that satisfy a council member during PROJECT ROYALE.
**O5-4:** You kept your cool when it was a necessity.
**O5-6:** And ya shot who needed to be shot when they needed to be shot.
**O5-8:** Thought through the simulation - need more minds like that.
**O5-1:** And most importantly, loyalty. No handing over classified documents for freebies, no killing the meek and undeserving when it suited you. Foundation blood, through and through.
**O5-2:** You are seen as worthy.
_The rest of the Council looks at O5-2, stunned._
**O5-2:** The trials set forth upon you, Anton, son of Maria and Andrei, were clear. You are one us the few, and it is an unchangeable truth.
_The council looks at Dr. Radu._
**O5-2:** No one man wishes upon himself this role. But it is a responsibility. A responsibility you have to the world, to protect the weak.
_A moment of silence._
**O5-2:** Your perception of your qualities is naught to the universe. This is the place you were always meant to be. I am sorry.
_A moment of long silence. Dr. Radu stares down at the table, tapping his fingers. The silence is only occasionally broken by the whirring of O5-3's mechanical body._
**A. Radu:** I see.
**O5-1:** I… I'm not one to speak of destiny, Anton, but it's true.
**O5-4:** The Foundation requires a 12th.
_Dr. Radu sighs._
**A. Radu:** Understood.
**O5-1:** Perfect. Then, Dr. Anton Radu, do you accept the promotion to the position of O5-12? For the sake of all normalcy, and the people who live within it?
_A. Radu nods his head for the last time._
**O5-12:** I do.
**O5-1:** Congratulations. Welcome to the O5 Council, the high and final authoritative body of the Foundation, O5-12. We have a lot of work to get done.
**O5-12:** You're darn right we do; and I know where to start.

**SPECIAL CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES:** SCP-7209 is stored within Site-Gamma, the 3rd level to Secure Facility 01, and is to only be interacted with in conjunction with the activation of PROJECT ROYALE. Regular mechanical maintenance is required by a rotating schedule of amnectisized level 1 mechanics and janitorial staff, who will be terminated and replaced in 1-month cycles. All individuals responsible for the construction of SCP-7209 will remain under close watch of the O5 Council if critical changes must be made.
![Tryton_supercomputer_Gdansk_University_of_Technology_2015.jpg](https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-7209/Tryton_supercomputer_Gdansk_University_of_Technology_2015.jpg)
SG-SE, Wing Alpha.
**DESCRIPTION:** SCP-7209 is the SWEENEY-GREENE SIMULACRUM ENGINE, a Class-4 Simulation Development, and Procedural Generation Mechanism, produced for the express purpose of PROJECT ROYALE.
SCP-7209 differs from most anomalous simulation mechanisms in that it receives inputs both from standard input code, as well as information stored in the simulation user's conscious and subconscious memory. This specific ability allows for the creation of 82.6% more believable simulations and is used proactively within PROJECT ROYALE to create a realistic environment in which O5 Candidates are unaware of their status inside the simulation.
SCP-7209 also contains a highly adaptive AIC complex (designed SCP-7209-Γ), which has been connected to all 13 members of the O5 Council. Activatable through remote passphrase entry, the AIC complex can receive mental inputs from the O5 Council to influence behavior within the simulation; the AIC is also programmed to act out the necessary steps of PROJECT ROYALE in conjunction with the environment generated by SCP-7209. This has been used to create "antagonists" to O5 Candidates during the thus far 7 iterations of PROJECT ROYALE, which have included: High Priest Robert Bumaro (Iteration 2, "AMONI-RAM"), P. Hudson Gock (Iteration 4, "GAME OVER") and The Engineer (Iteration 7, "CHAOS TAKEOVER").
**UPDATE**
By executive order of O5-12, with approval from a simple majority of the O5 Council, SCP-7209 has been decommissioned. Mechanical elements and materials are to be salvaged for future SIMULACRUM projects.
