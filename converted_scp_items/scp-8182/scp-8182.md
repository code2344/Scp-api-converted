Ectograph of SCP-8182 (right) and D-8182 (left) taken during initial containment.
**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-8182 and D-8182 are currently being held in a standard humanoid containment cell within Site 12's Euclid housing wing.
**Description:** SCP-8182 is a Class-A ectological lifeform resembling a 19 year old human male. SCP-8182 has demonstrated minor physical capabilities, being able to displace objects weighing up to 5kg. With the exception of D-8182, SCP-8182 can not be perceived without the aid of specialized ectological equipment. D-8182 is a 23 year old human female. Prior attempts at isolating SCP-8182 have resulted in severe psychological distress in both entities. Due to ease of containment and low priority no further attempts are to be made at this time.
**Discovery:** SCP-8182 was initially discovered and contained on October 21st, 2024. Please see addenda for associated logs.

> **PREFACE:** On September 6th, 2024, D-8182 was placed on Foundation Watchlist E-8000-24 after foundation AI within the American Psychiatric System flagged their reported hallucinations as potentially anomalous in nature. D-8182’s personal electronic devices were subsequently implanted with standard foundation monitoring programs. Recorded audio and video logs have been filtered and enhanced by Site 12’s ectology department.

> _D-8182 is located at the bathroom sink in their apartment. They are brushing their teeth as YouTube makeup tutorials play through their smartphone’s speakers. SCP-8182 is seen slowly brushing D-8182’s hair._
> **SCP-8182:** I don’t see why you can’t just try it for my sake. I mean how will you know if you never even give them a chance.
> **D-8182:** Don’t be a lech. I’m not dating girls just so you can get off.
> **SCP-8182:** I didn’t mean it like that. I just think if we are both going to enjoy it doesn’t it make more sense for-
> **D-8182:** If you don’t stop being gross Im going to fuck him tonight just to spite you
> _(pause)_
> **SCP-8182:** Oh please, you don’t need me to give you an excuse to be a slut.
> _They both chuckle softly. D-8182 applies a facial cleanser as SCP-8182 clips in her earrings._
> **SCP-8182:** Seriously though? A game designer? You might as well try dating a cop.
> **D-8182:** Phft… what do you know. He seems empathetic enough.
> **SCP-8182:** But that’s what I’m saying. With these nerdy introvert types its hard to tell just over text if they have some fucked up worldview.
> **D-8182:** You were a nerdy introvert type.
> **SCP-8182:** Yeah but I changed for you.
> _D-8182 snorts and begins to apply makeup._
> **D-8182:** Jokes aside I need you to promise me that you’ll at least try to be mature.
> _SCP-8182 rests their head on D-8182’s shoulder._
> **SCP-8182:** I promise.

> _D-8182 and SCP-8182 enter the building and are led by a hostess to a central table._
> **Civilian:** Oh my god, hi!
> **D-8182:** Hi.
> _D-8182 and the civilian hug. SCP-8182 is seen fidgeting with the silverware on the table. The hostess notices a fork shift slightly and stares at the table._
> **Civilian:** So… do you think we can get our drinks?
> _The hostess continues to stare at the silverware. The civilian waves their hand in front of the hostess’s face._
> **Civilian:** Hello? We’d like to order please.
> _The hostess starts._
> **Hostess:** My apologies, what can I get started for you two?
> **Civilian:** Perfect, I will have a rum and coke and she will have a…
> _The civilian gestures at D-8182._
> **D-8182:** Just a water thank you.
> **Hostess:** Alrighty, have those out for y’all in a jiff.
> **D-8182:** Thank you.
> **SCP-8182:** Alcohol right of the bat and he’s rude to wait staff. Tsk-tsk-tsk.
> _D-8182 purses their lips._
> **D-8182:** Actually ma’am could I please get your house margarita.
> **Hostess:** Of course.
> _D-8182 smiles as the hostess leaves, then glares at SCP-8182. The civilian glances in the same direction._
> **Civilian:** What are you looking at?
> **D-8182:** Oh, uh, nothing. I’m just really nervous.
> **Civilian:** Well don’t be. You look beautiful by the way.
> _SCP-8182 scoffs._
> **SCP-8182:** Real smooth my guy.
> **D-8182:** Thank you.
> **Civilian:** So what do you like to do for fun?
> **D-8182:** Well… I, um… you know I…
> _The civilian leans in._
> **D-8182:** I…
> _SCP-8182 places their hand gently on D-8182’s arm._
> **D-8182:** I like to do community theatre… Have you ever been?
> **Civilian:** I unfortunately can’t say I have. But I was in band in high school and we would play the score for the school’s musicals. But uh, just between you and me, I was only in the band to get closer to the band girls. Y’know real overachiever nerdy types. I actually thought I had a chance. Ha!
> **Hostess:** Here are your drinks.
> **Civillian:** Oh thank you. But anyway, community theatre. What made you decide to get into tha-
> _As he goes to take a sip of his rum and coke SCP-8182 grabs his arm yanking it upward and causing the civilian to spill the drink on himself._
> **Civilian:** Jesus Christ!
> **D-8182:** Stop it!
> _(pause)_
> **Hostess:** I’ll go get you a towel.
> **Civillian:** Thank you. I don’t know what that… gosh I’m so embarrassed. I’m so sorry. I’ll be right back. I’m just gonna head to the washroom. Please don’t leave. I still want to hear about your plays.
> _The civilian stands up and leaves the camera frame._
> **D-8182:** (whispering) What the fuck are you doing.
> **SCP-8182:** I’m ending this before we waste any more time on this schmuck.
> **D-8182:** I knew this would happen.
> **SCP-8182:** What?
> **D-8182:** You’re not even giving him a chance.
> **SCP-8182:** I am too.
> **D-8182:** No you’re not. It hasn’t even been five minutes and you’ve already assaulted him.
> **SCP-8182:** That was barely a push.
> **D-8182:** I knew we weren’t ready for this. You’re a fucking child.
> **SCP-8182:** A child?!
> **D-8182:** Yep, a child.
> _(pause)_
> **SCP-8182:** Okay. Well if I’m a child I guess I should just…
> _SCP-8182 bend down and grabs the spoons on the table._
> **D-8182:** You wouldn’t dare.
> _SCP-8182 lifts up the silverware and starts twirling them above D-8182’s head, knocking over the drinks, and intentionally drawing the attention of neighboring tables. Several other diners gasp and point. And a few bring out their phones to record._
> **D-8182:** Are you insane!
> _D-8182 bolts up and runs out of the camera frame._

Site 12’s security department was notified and a junior MTF detail was dispatched for containment and amnestitization. The following log was captured by D-8182’s smartphone’s microphone in Hermann Park, Houston. This audio has been filtered and enhanced by Site 12’s ectology department.

> _Estimated 60 seconds until MTF arrival._
> **D-8182:** You’re the one who said I should start dating! You said you wanted me to be happy.
> **SCP-8182:** I do, I just think we should be a little more selective. I mean come on. That guy was an asshole.
> **D-8182:** Maybe! But that was my call to make, not yours.
> **SCP-8182:** So what do I not even get a say.
> **D-8182:** No.
> **SCP-8182:** Wow. So I guess I’m just supposed to do nothing while you make all the important decisions in our life.
> **D-8182:** It’s not our life! Its mine!
> _(pause)_
> _Estimated 30 seconds until MTF arrival._
> **D-8182:** Look. I’m sorry your life was just so painful that you couldn’t handle it. But that doesn’t give you the right to take over mine. Sometimes I wish-
