Special Containment Procedures

Foundation WebCrawler Galileo.aic is to continuously monitor law enforcement agencies within the migratory path of the Canada Goose for increased reports of petty theft and other SCP-5106 related activities. Galileo.aic is also tasked with monitoring social media and video-sharing platforms for any mention of SCP-5106, or its associated activity. All evidence is to be discredited or removed, and all direct witnesses are to be amnesticized.

If SCP-5106 is located, a joint task force comprised of 

MTF Eta-4 ("Begone Thoth")

 and MTF Victor-17 (“Nature Boys”) members is to track and attempt to contain the anomaly.

Description

SCP-5106 is an avian entity resembling a Canada Goose (

Branta canadensis

), capable of communication in fluent English. SCP-5106 has heightened intelligence, though the extent of its cognitive capabilities is unknown. SCP-5106 displays a rudimentary understanding of subterfuge, slang terminology, interpersonal relations, and the barter system.

SCP-5106 is capable of commanding non-anomalous fauna to follow basic commands. It is unknown whether SCP-5106 uses some form of anomalous influence or if faunae follow the orders of their own volition. Though the full extent of this ability is unknown, SCP-5106 seems incapable of using it to affect humans and other species of higher intellect.

Discovery

SCP-5106 was initially discovered by civilians within Cattus Island State Park in Toms River, New Jersey. Following a drastic increase in theft-related incident reports, patrons of the park began reporting strange behavior in the local avian population. On 2020/08/13, a video depicting SCP-5106 related activity was uploaded to the media-sharing platform YouTube. The following is a transcript of the aforementioned video evidence which was flagged and transcribed by Galileo.aic:

 Carlos Vega (M 18), Randall White (M 19)

[BEGIN LOG]

[Carlos Vega is walking in front of the camera through a dimly lit playground.]

Carlos:

 Man, when you said we was goin' to see the birds, this isn't what I thought you meant.

Randall:

 Nah dude, I told you, the birds sold me this camera.

Carlos:

 The fuck you mean though?

Randall:

 I was eating lunch with Daniele over there. 

[Randall points around the camera toward a pavilion in the distance]

 and a fuckin' goose came up offering to sell us an iPhone, and I didn–

Carlos:

 How's a goose offering you shit, bro? You trippin'.

Randall:

 'Ight, bet. You'll see when we get there.

Carlos:

 Yeah, I'll see you're dumb as fuck.

Randall:

 Over here, this way.

[The two men walk through tall underbrush and several trees until they reach a small clearing.]

Randall:

 

[Speaking loudly.]

 Hey man, it's uh, it's me again. I brought my boy to come see you.

Unknown:

 Check em!

[Several dozen squirrels emerge from the treeline and encircle Carlos and Randall.]

Carlos:

 The fuck man, what are the– back the fuck up!

Randall:

 It's cool, they're just checkin' us out.

[The squirrels can be seen running over the two men and checking their pockets, waistbands, and ankles. After removing a pocket knife from Carlos's left sock, the squirrels retreat back into the trees.]

Carlos:

 On some real shit– did I just get robbed by a bunch of squirrels?

Randall:

 I don–

SCP-5106:

 Don't worry, they'll give it back when we're done with our transaction.

[SCP-5106 is seen entering the clearing encircled by eight Canadian geese.]

SCP-5106:

 How can we help you, boys?

[Several of the geese honk in the two men's direction. Carlos is visible confused.]

Carlos:

 I, uh– I…

Randall:

 Yeah we wanted to do some business with you, ma– you got a name bro?

SCP-5106:

 Yeah, I got one. But you can call me Don, kid.

Carlos:

 My man, what was in the blunt before, this goose just– Is this for real?

SCP-5106:

 Oh we got wise guy, huh? 

Your boy

 is eyein' me hard– he better quit gawkin' before 

my

 boys get squawkin'.

[Several of the geese flap their wings and honk in response]

Randall:

 Nah Don, we cool– right C.

[Randall nudges Carlos.]

Carlos:

 Uh– yeah, we good.

[SCP-5106 and its accompanying geese walk several meters closer to the two men.]

SCP-5106:

 We've been here too long, what do you want?

Randall:

 My boy needs a new phone.

[SCP-5106 extends its neck towards Carlos and inspects him.]

SCP-5106:

 Android or iPhone?

Carlos:

 Uh– Android.

[SCP-5106 turns its head toward Randall.]

SCP-5106:

 You got the bread?

[Randall holds a stuffed manila envelope toward SCP-5106.]

Randall:

 Five big ones, just like you said.

Carlos:

 500? Bro, that's a lot of doe, wher–

Randall:

 Don't worry man, Ma gave it to me.

SCP-5106:

 Flaps, go get it.

[One of the geese flies into the treeline. It returns approximately one minute later carrying a plastic shopping bag in its beak.]

SCP-5106:

 Galaxy S20.

[The goose drops the plastic bag at Carlos's feet before waddling back to SCP-5106.]

Carlos:

 Yeah, okay.

[Randall makes an exaggerated coughing noise.]

Carlos:

 I mean– good looks man, thanks.

SCP-5106:

 Yeah, just pay up and scram– we've wasted enough time on you already.

[Randall opens the envelope revealing five slices of marble rye bread; he gently removes them from the envelope. Randall rips the bread into small chunks and spreads them on the ground. SCP-5106 and the other geese honk and flap their wings; in unison, they swarm and consume the bread pieces. After finishing the bread, SCP-5106 and its geese fly away.]

Carlos:

 That– that was some, I don't ev– who the fuck's gonna believe this shit.

[Randall shakes the camera towards Carlos.]

Randall:

 Everyone, man, I got that shit on here.

[The two men walk out of the clearing and back through the underbrush.]

Carlos:

 Yeah but, even on film, I don't know if I'd believe that shit– and I was there, man.

Randall:

 Yeah, we'll see.

[END LOG]

Following a brief investigation to confirm anomalous activity, the Foundation deployed a two-man detachment of MTF Victor-17 with a five-member avian pursuit team as support. The following is a transcript of their encounter:

Date:

Depicted:

 Agent Lazzo Finch, Agent Dillon Crane, Site-51 Avian Unit 3

Foreword:

 The agents set a live animal trap rigged with rye bread within the clearing SCP-5106 was previously encountered in. Finch and Crane are to remain hidden in the tree line for SCP-5106 to appear, at which time it will be tranquilized. Avian Unit 3 will remain on standby within the treetop and will pursue SCP-5106 if it attempts to escape.

[BEGIN LOG]

[Agents Finch and Crane are crouched in the underbrush facing towards SCP-5106's clearing.]

Finch:

 How long is this gonna take? Do you think they're on to us, Crane?

Crane:

 No, I don't think so, the bird unit hasn't noted any movement.

Finch:

 Maybe they're off trying to sell people stolen junk.

[Both agents laugh.]

Crane:

 What a fuckin job.

Finch:

 You can say that again. Shit, this is probably one of the least weird cases we've had in months.

Crane:

 Yeah, I know–

Finch:

 Shhh. Look, over there.

[Finch points towards the western end of the clearing, movement can be seen in the underbrush. A total of 14 geese exit the tree line and enter the clearing.]

Crane:

 That trap isn't holding all of them. How many tranq rounds do we have?

Finch:

 Five.

Crane:

 Shit, run back to the truck, grab another case of rounds. And be quick about it, we don't want them getting spooked.

Finch:

 You got it.

[Finch crawls through the brush for several meters before standing and running towards the truck.]

Finch:

 Just cause he's old as shit I gotta do the grunt work–

[Agent Finch stops several meters from the truck, the back doors are open and a large quantity of geese footprints can be seen on the ground. Finch quickly sprints to the back end of the truck and looks inside.]

Finch:

 

[Over radio.]

 Uh, Crane, we got a problem.

[The truck previously filled with various equipment is now empty; the five parrots composing Avian Unit 3 are unconscious and bound together with vines.]

Crane:

 

[Over radio.]

 Hurry up, I think they're on to us.

Finch:

 

[Over radio.]

 Avian Unit 3 is down, and I– I think we've been robbed.

[Finch unties the unconscious parrots.]

Crane:

 

[Over radio.]

 What?

Finch:

 

[Over radio.]

 All of our equipment is gone!

Crane:

 

[Over radio.]

 Those little fucks! Get back here.

Finch:

 

[Over radio.]

 Coming.

Crane:

 

[Over radio.]

 I'm sending a backup request to command.

[Agent Finch sprints back to Crane.]

Finch

 What's the plan?

Crane:

 We don't even know if one of them is the one we need. If we scare them off we won't have a pursuit team.

Finch:

 Why don't one of us wait here and the other go out there and try talking to them? If one of them answers we shoot that one with the tranq.

Crane:

 Since backup is 40 minutes out, it's worth a shot.

Finch:

 OK, take this.

[Agent Finch hands Crane the tranquilizer rifle. Finch stands and walks into the clearing.]

Finch:

 Okay, guys, looks like we got off on the wrong foot, how about we just talk this out?

[The geese immediately face Finch and begin to honk.]

Finch:

 I know at least one of you can talk– let's just work this out.

SCP-5106:

 I think this has worked out just fine for us.

Crane:

 Finch, I can't tell which one is talking– you gotta get it to step out of the group.

Finch:

 As far as I can tell you're a business ma– goose, so let's do business.

[One of the geese steps from the group, a black rectangular object can be seen on its back.]

SCP-5106:

 Okay then, let's make a de–

[Crane fires two tranquilizer rounds into the goose after several seconds of stumbling the goose falls to the ground. The remaining geese fly away in response.]

Crane:

 Got it.

[Crane exits the treeline and the two Agents approach the fallen goose.]

SCP-5106:

 Only thing you got was played! 

[Various honks can be heard in the background.]

Finch:

 What the fuck…

[Finch pushes the goose over revealing a Foundation issued handheld radio attached to its back. Honking can be heard from above. The two Agents look up in time to see a Foundation issue electrified capture net falling on them.]

Crane:

 Ah shit.

[END LOG]

Containment Team Alpha 4 arrived within a half-hour; the two MTF Victor-17 agents were discovered unconscious within the clearing. The entirety of Cattus Island State Park's Goose population, as well as SCP-5106, could no longer be located. The tracking devices within the stolen Foundation equipment were found in a trashcan within the park. The Foundation Parazoology Division is currently formulating possible migration patterns for SCP-5106 and its flock.
