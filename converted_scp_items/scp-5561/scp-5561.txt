Item #:

 SCP-5561

Object Class:

 Safe

6

Special Containment Procedures:

 The hard drive on which SCP-5561 resides must be kept in a storage locker at Auxiliary Research Facility-19. Webcrawlers are to scan for images on the internet that exhibit the anomalous effect of SCP-5561. Samuel Fitzgerald is to be under Foundation care until 2021/02/02.

As of 2020/02/02 no other instances of the "Lord Marquaad E" meme exhibit anomalous effects.

Description:

 SCP-5561 is a save file of an internet meme referred to as "Lord Marquaad E". It is an image of YouTuber Mark 

"Markiplier"

 Fischbach's and Lord Farquaad's

7

 faces merged together and super imposed over an image from the Mark Zuckerberg Congressional Hearings

8

.

The effects of SCP-5561 become apparent whenever the save file on the hard drive is directly referenced in a bureaucratic document. All language is replaced by the capital letter "E". SCP-5561 does not replace the letters in a document not directly referencing the save file; however, the nomenclature for Mr. Fischbach's username will vary in text referencing the anomaly.

SCP-5561 was discovered on a hard drive belonging to Samuel Fitzgerald, an anthropology student who attended Ohio State University. As a class assignment, Mr. Fitzgerald wrote a thesis on "Lord Marquaad E".

SCP-5561's secondary effect is the inability of Mr. Fitzgerald to write consequential bureaucratic documents

9

. Additionally, the subject is further incapable of saying the name of 

the horror game YouTuber

. Amnestics are recorded to have no effect.

The Foundation reached out to Mark Fischbach for questioning. Mr. Fischbach declined an interview and was under Foundation surveillance for 30 days. In that time no anomalous activity was detected.

As of 2020/02/02 Samuel Fitzgerald is the only known individual to exhibit SCP-5561's secondary effect.

Addendum-1:

 Emails and minutes of Samuel Fitzgerald's disciplinary hearing were acquired by the Foundation.

Disciplinary Hearing minutes:

 

Date:

 11/12/2019

Leader:

 Elizabeth Dower

Facilitator:

 Kenton Moraines

Recorder:

 Valery Trace

Time Keeper:

 Richard Jones

Attendees:

 Harvey Grey, Samuel Fitzgerald, Annabelle Ward, Samantha Cole, Hugh Hensworth

Agenda Topic:

 Disciplinary action of Mr. Samuel Fitzgerald's breach of school conduct

Time allotted:

 One hour

Discussions:

 Mr. Moraines discussed the emails, and verbal harassment Professor Grey received from Mr. Fitzgerald over the course of the semester. Mr. Fitzgerald stated that the assignments were effected by technical errors as the documents had been normal when he sent them. Professor Grey commented fearing the harassment was due to false charges of ableism earlier in the semester.

Mr. Fitzgerald became irate saying that him and a majority of the class had reported Professor Grey for harassing a deaf student and her sign language interpreter. This incident had been reported to the college but was dropped due to there being little evidence and Professor Grey's recent tenure.

Mr. Moraines asked Mr. Fitzgerald if his harassment towards Professor Grey was related to the incident. Mr. Fitzgerald said he hadn't harassed Professor Grey and upon further questioning Mr. Fitzgerald became aggressive and threatened the committee. Mr. Fitzgerald had to be escorted off campus.

Conclusions:

 The committee calls for expulsion and will vote via private committee on what action to take. Furthermore, the committee will be sending an email of their decision

 Results of Hearing

Date:

 11/16/2019

Samuel Fitzgerald,

Due to the charges of harassment against you, and your actions at the hearing unbecoming of a Buckeye student, the Office of Academic Affairs have decided to expel you from Ohio State University. There is no option to repeal the decision due to the severity of the case.

-Kenton Moraines

Head of the Office of Academic Affairs

Fax: 614-292-3658

Addendum-3:

 During investigations, Samuel Fitzgerald's apartment was found in a state of disarray. The home office was covered in hardcopies of the assignment, a printer with no ink and the bathroom mirror broken. An interview with Samuel Fitzgerald was requested.

Interviewer:

 Agent Królik

Interviewee:

 Samuel Fitzgerald

Date:

 2019/11/18

<Begin Log>

Królik:

 Thank you for the interview. I'm Agent Królik. 

(extends his hand)

Fitzgerald:

 

(accepts handshake)

 It's nice that someone doesn't think I'm lying.

Królik:

 According to your account, you wrote a thesis about this meme?

Fitzgerald:

 Tried to, yes.

Królik:

 -both an attached document sent from your computer and a hardcopy given to the professor, had all letters replaced with a capital letter "E"?

Fitzgerald:

 …that's correct. 

(pauses)

 …they weren't when I sent them. Please believe me.

Królik:

 I do, next question, where did you download the image from?

Fitzgerald:

 I don't know? Discord or IRC? I don't remember.

Królik:

 That's understandable. 

(clears throat)

 Were you harassing Professor Harvey Grey with these memes?

Fitzgerald:

 NO! For fuck's sake, no!! I was trying to turn in this fucking assignment!

Królik:

 

(taking notes)

 Calm down please!

[Silence]

Królik:

 Was the harassment of Professor Grey fueled by his charge dismissal?

Fitzgerald:

 I'm not harassing him period. 

(grits his teeth)

 This is what I've been trying to say.

Królik:

 Mr. Fitzgerald, I understand your frustration with him but please answer the question.

Fitzgerald:

 …It wasn't fueled by the dismissal.

Królik:

 Thank you. Last question and then you'll be on your way.

Fitzgerald:

 

(hands tremble)

 …OK.

Królik:

 Say the name 

Darkiplier

.

10

[Fitzgerald shifts nervously in his chair and opens his mouth to speak. Camera records his mouth sounding out the name of 

the gamer from Ohio

; although, audio records him saying 

the man who runs head first into the dark

.]

Fitzgerald:

 …I became aware of this during the hearing.

[Silence.]

Fitzgerald:

 They thought I was mocking and threatening them, and it escalated… 

(stares at the backwall)

 …all I remember is being escorted off campus.

Królik:

 I feel we're finished with the interview. Thank you again for your cooperation.

[The session ends and security enters the room and escorts Samuel Fitzgerald to amnestic administration. After it was discovered that amnestics had no effect on the anomaly, Mr. Fitzgerald was court ordered to attend weekly therapy sessions at a Foundation cover hospital.]
