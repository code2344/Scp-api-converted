Investigations into GOI-850 are ongoing and are headed by Project Labyrinth personnel.
Due to its extremely hazardous capabilities, SCP-3580 is not to be confronted by personnel. Attempts to capture it are to be conducted solely by specialized operatives. Unrelated or standard Mobile Task Force units are not advised for deployment against SCP-3580. No less than two Nu-7 units are to be immediately dispatched for appearances of SCP-3580.
Disinformation campaigns have been initiated to conceal the nature of the Türkiye incident. Attempts at neutralizing or minimizing the ongoing conflict between Germany and Türkiye are underway.
Locating SCP-3580, as well as other members of GOI-850, has been deemed Priority Level BETA.

[![Prosthetic](https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--resized-images/fragment:scp-3580-0/Prosthetic/medium.jpg)](https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/fragment:scp-3580-0/Prosthetic)
Damaged right-arm prosthesis dropped by SCP-3580.
  
SCP-3580 denotes a feminine humanoid entity belonging to GOI-850 ("Order of the Archine Eclipse").A secretive organization dedicated to collecting and harboring items of importance in anomalous history. All known members are highly dangerous and possess various anomalous traits.. 
Physically, SCP-3580 is 190 cm in height with tied black hair reaching down to its waist. Missing both its arms, SCP-3580 utilizes thaumaturgically enhanced prosthetics. The entity's ethnicity is unknown.
While interactions with SCP-3580 have been scarce, it is known that it possesses incredible proficiency in close-quarters combat, specializing in the usage of edged weapons. It is also capable of moving and reacting at rapid speeds, with one instance displaying an estimated 65 km/h.
In addition, it has been found that SCP-3580 possesses an advanced degree of expertise in combat-related areas of thaumaturgy, utilizing these skills for primarily defensive purposes during observed conflicts.
It has been found through recovered correspondence that SCP-3580 is regarded as "Inquisitor Proxima Ramexe" among GOI-850 members.
* * *
SCP-3580-A is a humanoid entity, measuring roughly 400cm in height, belonging to GOI-850.
Physically, SCP-3580-A possesses thick wrapping around its entire body with metallic plates placed around the shoulders, shins, thighs, forearms, back, neck, jaw, and head. Its left arm has been replaced by a mounted sextuple-barreled Gatling gun of an unknown model, with built-in ammunition reserves along its figure.
SCP-3580, alongside SCP-3580-A, has engaged in multiple raids on Foundation sites, leading to various numbers of casualties while stealing artifacts and documents, or releasing persons of interest. Contact with other under-the-Veil agencies has reported few but several occasions of being attacked or approached by, SCP-3580, SCP-3580-A, or other members of GOI-850.
* * *
**Discovery:**
* * *
SCP-3580 was first observed on 18/2/1971 during a raid on Site-41 which resulted in the deaths of fourteen personnel. One person in this group was the Site Director, Malkin Fallen, who refused SCP-3580's demands for him to open containment cells on the lower floors as Mobile Task Force operatives moved in.
When the incident concluded, several anomalous items were found to have been stolen, and an open terminal with level-3 submitted clearance entered was discovered. The terminal had been used to access all available topics relating to GOI-850, certain anomalies, and a brief attempt to uncover the location of Area-55 - the base of operations for Project Labyrinth investigations. This attempt was unsuccessful.
Near the end of the incident, multiple MTFs were deployed to Site-41, including Nu-7 ("Hammer Down") and Epsilon 11 ("Nine-Tailed Fox"). However, they proved ineffective at stopping SCP-3580, resulting in its escape and subsequent disappearance.
That same year, SCP-3580-A was first observed during the failed detainment of POI-9112 ."Kevin Gibson", an identified affiliate of GOI-850. Wanted for human trafficking.. During that incident, SCP-3580-A intervened, killing four operatives and injuring the fifth before proceeding to terminate POI-9112.
Before it fled, SCP-3580-A interacted with the fifth agent - Agent Mortimer Woodlock. A transcript of the after-action report has been provided below.
**Internal log - Woodlock and Riley dialogue**
_Agent Woodlock and Senior Researcher Jackie Riley are seated in an interview room._
**Riley:** How're ya holding up, Morty?
**Woodlock:** I've been better.
**Riley:** Mm. I'm really, really sorry for what happened. I'm sure your team would be glad to know you survived.
**Woodlock:** It's just a part of the job. Come on, Jacks, you brought me here for a sob story or what?
**Riley:** Right. We wanted to know the specifics of what went on, on the twenty-first. What went wrong, what was that thing, just what happened?
_Woodlock adjusts himself in his chair._
**Woodlock:** Well, it was all going smoothly. Got the bastard up in cuffs at his home and we were fixing to leave. To be honest, for all he did, just being held in a cell didn't seem like justice to me.
**Riley:** What would have been justice, then?
**Woodlock:** _Careful what you wish for_ played a bit in my mind after the fact.
**Riley:** Mm.
**Woodlock:** So we'd just cuffed him up and we were just about to move out. Suddenly, Kamsky starts shouting in the back. Says "Get down!"… I don't think he was alive by the time he hit the deck.
_Woodlock briefly pauses before continuing._
**Woodlock:** Bullets start spraying everywhere. Kamsky went first, then Rodriguez… Allison… and the Captain. Was lucky I got behind cover in the kitchen, so I grab Gibson and pull him down with me. Even luckier I only got nicked.
**Riley:** I wouldn't say almost losing your leg was a "nick".
_Woodlock leans forward with his elbow on his injured knee._
**Woodlock:** Sure, Jacks. Sure.
**Riley:** Sorry.
**Woodlock:** Now, as I was saying, I'm holding this idiot and he's screaming bloody murder. Of course, I can barely hear him since I didn't have my hearing protection in, and the gun show just started about twenty feet away.
**Woodlock:** But even while Gibson's crying like a baby, I could feel something - a rumbling. There was a shadow on the wall, and it was coming towards us. I could barely move, so I crawl over to hide behind the kitchen counter. I try to drag Gibson with me, but - too late. He gets picked up.
**Woodlock:** I look up and see this huge hulking thing standing there, hoisting Gibson by the neck. It's gigantic - has to get down on one knee just to fit in the room. Covered in what looked like roughed-up armor. Knight shit. It had these, these glowing green eyes that shot through the thing's mask. And a great big gun on one of its arms.
_He leans back._
**Woodlock:** So it holds Gibson up and looks him in the eye. I can't hear what it says, and it looked like Gibson was just begging for his life. All I see after is a quick movement, just some shadows and a dust cloud falls from the wall. Gibson's brains are splattered everywhere, and his body falls backward from up on top the kitchen sink.
**Woodlock:** So I try to scoot away. I'm losing a lot of blood, so I try to treat it at the same time. I'm panicking - not thinking straight. Then it noticed me.
_His fists clench._
**Woodlock:** It nudges over and looms over me. My ears start to clear, and I can hear it speaking.
**Riley:** What did it say?
**Woodlock:** Couldn't make out exactly what, but it did say something along the lines of an apology. I tried to raise my gun - big fucking mistake.
**Woodlock:** I take a shot at its face, it clocks me so hard in the arm the pistol goes flying and my hand feels twelve types of broken.
_He raises his right arm, showcasing the cast._
**Woodlock:** It stands up and glares down at me with those cold eyes. It just stood there for like a minute, watching me writhing before it decided I wasn't worth it. I pass out and get rescued like a princess.
**Riley:** I don't know what to say, Morty, I-
**Woodlock:** You don't have to say anything. It's just part of the job. It's always just a part of the job.
* * *
  
These incidents marked the first time either entity was observed before they both disappeared for a period of eight years. During this time, Leonel M. Fallen, the son of the late Malkin Fallen, was inducted into the Foundation at the age of seventeen.

## **Addenda: 3580.1:**
* * *
On 4/9/1978, SCP-3580 engaged in an attack on Site-102, killing multiple personnel in the process.
After on-site security failed to hinder SCP-3580, off-site MTF were called in and arrived twenty minutes after the entity had made contact.
[[Open Security Log-3580/1]](javascript:;)
[[Close Security Log-3580/1]](javascript:;)
**Security log**
_Six heavily equipped operatives sprint through the facility. The local site director monitors their progress through the security feed. An additional six agents close in from the opposite end of the facility, with both teams converging on the same point - a Keter-class enlarged testing chamber._
_The first team moves in through the only entrance to the room, viewing SCP-3580 in the center facing the far wall. The secondary team moves to the one-way mirror control room and aims with specialized stun agent-based projectiles._
_In its left hand, SCP-3580 holds the sheath of a sword._
**Captain Renner:** Alright, surrender and put your weapon on the ground or we will be forced to shoot!
_The agents move in, making a V formation behind the Captain, all taking aim._
**SCP-3580:** Not likely.
**Cpt. Renner:** Final call, lady. I said put it down!
_SCP-3580 looks up at the ceiling._
**SCP-3580:** And what fun would that be, soldier?
_Renner pulls up his radio and gives the signal for the secondary team to open fire._
**SCP-3580:** Here we go again.
_The secondary agents all fire._
_SCP-3580 immediately leaps into the air, above all the incoming bullets, and creates a thaumic mid-air platform before bounding off of it and heading straight for the window._
_Both teams fire on it, which it dodges with a series of rapid movements - bouncing between thaumic platforms in the air - before slashing through the shot-out remains of the window pane and into the control room._
_It quickly executes two agents with one swipe while the rest back away. It then slices straight through an operative's neck, decapitating him instantly._
_One operative attempts to run out of the room, grabbing the door handle before her arm is cut off._
_The two other agents back up and shoot at SCP-3580 again. It turns, grabs the disarmed operative, and charges forward with her body absorbing all the special rounds. It quickly impales the first agent, whips the other with the handle of its sword, and slashes his throat._
_Outside, the primary team forms around the window and looks inside, seeing nothing but the gore-stained chamber._
_They back away, and agents consult with Renner._
**Cpt. Renner:** Everybody, stay calm! Wilson, what just happened?
**Site Director Wilson:** It, it… Jesus. I'm switching between feeds now, I can't find it.
**Cpt. Renner:** Alright people, stay close. Wilson, just keep looking for it.
_The sound of SCP-3580's laughter is heard echoing through the chamber, with no apparent source._
_The team huddles close and forms a tight circle._
**Cpt. Renner:** Wilson, give me something to work with here.
**Dir. Wilson:** I'm looking everywhere!
_White powder falls._
**Dir. Wilson:** Wait - Captain, scatter!
_SCP-3580 breaks through the roof, blade in hand, and leaps downward._
_The agents look up._
_They try to raise their weapons at it._
_It lands and slices through all six with one strike; their bodies all fall limp to the ground._
_Walking toward a nearby camera, SCP-3580 cackles to itself as it wipes its sword with two fingers. It sighs and grabs ahold of the camera, staring into it._
**SCP-3580:** You should be better than this. Send your best next time; I'll be waiting, _Venator_.
_The camera loses visuals as SCP-3580 flicks a splatter of blood on it._
* * *
SCP-3580 then proceeded through the facility. It made its way to several lockdown bunkers, breaking into them and searching for a researcher with level-4 clearance. It escorted Senior Researcher Julian Ross to a secure access terminal, demanding he input his credentials into the system and give it access to the database. He obliged.According to Ross, he had forgotten all emergency mock credentials that would immediately display a memetic kill agent, lock the terminal, or engage further site lockdown procedures at the time..
The terminal's history showed a single focus - discovering the location of Area-55. This attempt was successful. A notice to Area-55's Site Director has been sent, and emergency lockdown procedures have been issued.
The following is a Project Labyrinth briefing pertaining to topics of GOI-850.
### GOI-850 / Order of the Archine Eclipse
Presented by Senior Researcher Jackie Riley
* * *
GOI-850 is a highly secretive, loosely organized international religious group comprised of both standard and anomalous humanoids. Evidence of GOI-850's existence dates as far back as the 18th century, though it is believed that it has existed for far longer than that.
GOI-850 has been credited with the theft of multiple items of interest to anomalous history - an undefined amount of the past that has either been forgotten or hidden from the Foundation or the general public. Such items that have gone missing range widely in subjects, from enchanted weaponry of old to evidence of the Siege of the Hearth.
It is believed that GOI-850 operates outside of multiple unknown locations, having spread out across the Earth following a failed attempt at securing their original facility in the early 1800s. After this attempt, however, GOI-850 went into an elongated state of dormancy as the mission had, purportedly, heavily crippled their ranks.
GOI-850 is primarily maintained by an unknown number of enhanced humanoids - referred to as "Knights" - only one of which has been observed and contained by the Foundation, excluding SCP-3580 and SCP-3580-A. Analysis of this entity revealed a mixture of crude carnomantic.Thaumaturgic manipulation of flesh and living matter., technological, and thaumaturgical procedures had been performed on it, leading to its aforementioned augmentations.
The group is devoted to a figure known as "Archine", an ancient hero credited for having imprisoned multiple monsters, including a large bird-like beast that had been terrorizing a village.
Recently, however, with the identification of POI-9112, it has become known that GOI-850 engages in acts of slavery. Thus far, no person having gone missing as a victim of POI-9112 has resurfaced.
Further details on GOI-850 are scarce, unprovable, or unknown. Investigations are ongoing.

[![Morty](https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--resized-images/fragment:scp-3580-0/Morty/medium.jpg)](https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/fragment:scp-3580-0/Morty)
MTF Sigma-8 Captain Mortimer Woodlock.
In light of recent events, resources have been pooled into creating a temporary MTF unit solely for combatting and containing SCP-3580. This group, managed by Captain Mortimer Woodlock, utilizes several kinds of prototypical anomalous weaponry and armor selected to deal with the subject.
Currently, the team (Sigma-8 "Hellbound Cavalry") is composed of seven operatives picked from multiple high-ranking units, and chosen for having experience in close-quarters combat. Given the threat displayed during Incident-3580-1 and Incident-3580-2, proposals have been made for agents under Sigma-8 to undergo augmentation, pending approval.
**Internal log - Woodlock and Samuel dialogue**
_The two are talking as they walk through the upper facility of Area-55._
**Samuel:** This place might as well be a fortress, especially now on lockdown. Increased security, an MTF, yours excluded, on standby not far from here, several dozen levels full of architecture designed to handle rampaging anomalies, not to mention the big-bad re-containment specialist director themself.
_They step onto a hanging catwalk overlooking the containment chamber for a massive half-serpentine entity secured with chains and other restraints._
**Samuel:** We've collected every piece on GOI-850 the site has and placed it all into a secure area on the lower floors. Personnel with clearance 4 have temporarily had their levels demoted to their lowest necessary access. Lockdown's a pain, but the safety of the site comes first.
_Woodlock nods along._
**Samuel:** A team and I examined the recording of it fighting; while its technique is unorthodox, its most alarming facet, besides its swiftness, is its incredible strength. We'll have to better prepare your agents to counteract that attribute.
**Woodlock:** Twelve good men and women dead for its sadistic pleasure. Do whatever it takes. We won't be burying any more.
**Samuel:** Well, Captain, if you are approved for those augments, I'd imagine taking it on would be made much simpler. Tracking it has proved rather fruitless; the only lead we found was an attack on the GOC, which reported a description similar to SCP-3580 over a year ago. Killed the entire strike force of five mercenaries before kidnapping their target - some reality bender kid.
**Woodlock:** _Great_ , so bupkis on where it is now?
**Samuel:** Unfortunately so. We're working as quickly as possible to find anything on it, but between the roadblocks we're already facing and the fact that the woman may as well be a ghost, we'd be lucky to find a single somewhat worthwhile bead.
_Samuel stops and stares down into the containment chasm._
**Samuel:** How's the team going? The director expressed their disapproval of this task force's creation, and I'd like something to show to hold them over.
**Woodlock:** It's going about as well as it could be. Not many hiccups or problems. Hell, we even got a mage on the job.
**Samuel:** So you think they'll be ready to deploy and combat SCP-3580 should the need arise?
**Woodlock:** Maybe. I've been rushing them to get ready as quickly as they can manage since we only have one shot at this.
**Samuel:** Take your time, Morty. It disappeared for years after its first appearance.
**Woodlock:** Wouldn't be wise to depend on that. It disappeared because it screwed up. It couldn't get what it wanted so it hid from us, just like the first time we came knocking on their doorstep.
**Woodlock:** That wasn't the last period of Order activity either, it was just the last time we saw their ace in action. They probably spent all this time trying to find another site to attack and how to properly get in and out.
**Woodlock:** We're running out of time, Sam. And maybe, maybe they're running out of time as well.
* * *
Several requests have been filed by Junior Researcher Fallen to participate in Sigma-8's activities, all of which have been denied.
**Internal log - Woodlock and Fallen dialogue**
_Captain Woodlock is overwatching the operatives of Sigma-8 practice with their weaponry in an underground range at Area-55. Junior Researcher Fallen enters the chamber and walks up to Woodlock._
**Fallen:** Hey, Captain, sir.
**Woodlock:** I have a name, y'know. What do you need now?
**Fallen:** I'm here about that rejection.
_Woodlock huffs._
**Woodlock:** Look, take it up with the dictator. I'm not the one refusing your applications.
**Fallen:** Well, could you talk to "them" for me?
**Woodlock:** And say what? "Yeah, he's fresh out of preschool and ready to brawl with the ninja".
**Fallen:** Sir-
**Woodlock:** I kinda agree with 'em. Look, I know what you're playing here. You're angry, you're upset, but throwing yourself at a deranged lunatic ain't gonna bring your old man back.
**Fallen:** Well what else can I do to help?
**Woodlock:** You can stick around and help your mother get through this. I imagine she's going through the same shit as you. She needs you.
**Fallen:** She…
**Woodlock:** Yes?
_There is silence for a second._
**Fallen:** Please, this is all I have - this is all I can do.
**Woodlock:** You can work on your career. You can get a grip on your life.
**Fallen:** That's what I'm doing right now, sir. If you just gave me a chance.
**Woodlock:** I told you: talk to the director. There just isn't much I can do on this end without their say-so.
**Fallen:** Fine, but I'm not giving up on this.
**Woodlock:** You really should.
**Fallen:** I can't. I just - I can't walk away from this. I owe him that much, at least.
_He turns heads for the exit. Woodlock sighs._
_Before Fallen makes it to the door, Woodlock calls out to him._
**Woodlock:** Hey kid!
_Fallen turns back, his hand on the handle._
**Woodlock:** I'll try to put in the good word for you. Just don't make me regret it.
**Fallen:** Thank you. I won't let you down, sir.

## **Addenda: 3580.3:**
* * *
On 14/10/1978, [POI-1492](/scp-7276)."Jane Woodrow", an identified member of GOI-850. Wanted for eight cases of murder. was located and captured. Because of her potential information on GOI-850's affairs, an armored van transport carrying two agents of Sigma-8 was dispatched to secure and deliver her to Area-55 for questioning.
During POI-1492's transit, however, the van was intercepted by SCP-3580, who proceeded to kill all four Foundation personnel on board and capture POI-1492. Both targets managed to escape before additional forces could arrive.
Because of this, Sigma-8 has been cleared for the use of augmentations sourced from trusted anomalous vendors for combat. These augments will be voluntary to operatives and will be fully covered by the Foundation. These cybernetic additions will aim to enhance agents' abilities during engagements, stimulating increased muscle capacity and speed.
**To:** Assistant Director Samuel McManus  
**From:** Captain Mortimer Woodlock
* * *
Two of mine are dead, and two of yours are dead. Samuel, I told you that divvying the team up was the wrong move. Lockdown or not, this team was built on cooperation and combined strength, not taking on the black ninja one at a time.
Throwing more and more agents at this thing haphazardly isn't working. More people who are never going home won't solve anything. If you want 3580 in custody, then I need to be in control of this operation and how we go about bringing it down, not you. We can't afford another screw-up.
Don't interfere with my end of this again.
The following was recorded at the privately held memorial ceremony for Agents Donovan and Williams.
**Internal log - Woodlock and Fallen dialogue**
_Footage is taken from an outside off-site training ground near Area-55. The remaining operatives of Sigma-8 are gathered, each holding up an umbrella to protect their cybernetic augmentations._
_In front of them are two photographs nailed to a tree, one depicting Agent Donovan during a party, two bottles of liquor in hand as he extends both middle fingers to the camera. The other shows Agent Williams posing with a shot-out paper target with the caption: "Accepted!!"._
_Captain Woodlock is seated on a fold-up chair. Researcher Fallen is likewise present. After several speeches are said, he slowly makes his way over to Woodlock, standing beside him._
**Fallen:** Hey, Captain.
**Woodlock:** Don't do this.
**Fallen:** Sir, I-
_Woodlock briefly turns._
**Woodlock:** _Kid._
_Fallen pauses for a moment as he begins shaking. He walks around to stand in front of Woodlock Woodlock._
**Fallen:** Those fuckers need to pay!
_His shouting draws the attention of other participants._
**Fallen:** You all know it's true. They've been killing our people for years. Years! My father died eight years ago, and now you're burying your family too!
**Woodlock:** Stop.
**Fallen:** No! I'm not going to sit around and wait for someone else to deal with them. To take that bitch down! She's out there, right now, doing god knows what. Hurting god knows how many people?!
_He takes several deep breaths._
**Fallen:** What about your old team, Captain?
**Woodlock:** _**Sit down, Leon**_.
**Fallen:** What does this badge even stand for?
_He tugs on a Foundation emblem on his jacket._
**Fallen:** Contain… protect? Protecting who? Containing what? People are dead, and I, I …
_He pauses._
**Fallen:** Captain Mortimer, sir, I'm either going to join your team, or I'm leaving. I can't take sitting around doing nothing anymore, getting nothing done as that monster slaughters us like cattle. I just can't.
_He turns and quietly walks away. The others there all become silent._
* * *
Due to the ongoing threat presented by SCP-3580, additional agents for Sigma-8 have been considered to replace the newly opened positions. So far, four more candidates have been chosen, and are currently undergoing training.

**Name:** Fallen, Leonel Maelstrom
**Security Clearance:** 3
**Employed As:** Junior Researcher / Field Agent
**Current Assignment:** Area-55 Engineering / SCP-3580
**Personnel Report:** Following the loss of his father, Site Director Malkin Fallen, during a containment breach, Mr. Fallen was offered a position with the Foundation after assessing his ability to adapt to the workforce and his sufficient talents and intelligence.
At first, he showed a level of maturity regarding the unfortunate incident and acclimated fairly well into the Foundation. However, shortly after the death of his civilian mother, Josephine Fallen, his demeanor took a rapid decline, both in his work and his social skills, and he took up a great interest in SCP-3580's case.It is unknown how Fallen had managed to bypass the security level requirement, though it is suspected that the document was leaked by a superior member of faculty..
Presently, Mr. Fallen has submitted five separate requests to enlist in MTF Sigma-8's activities in the containment of SCP-3580. Upon the fifth attempt, the request was tentatively granted by Director Roufhous with a recommendation from Captain Mortimer Woodlock on the condition that Mr. Fallen would be closely monitored during training and engagements.

On 11/3/1979, SCP-3580 engaged in an assault on Area-55.
[[Open Security Log-3580/2/3]](javascript:;)
[[Close Security Log-3580/2/3]](javascript:;)
**Security log**
_After having breached through the entrance, SCP-3580 proceeded through several hallways and junctures, eventually making it to one of the central stairways. By this time, standard MTF units have moved in, occupying and guarding populated areas as personnel make their way to security shelters._
_MTF Sigma-8 has now finished preparations and is now heading to intercept SCP-3580. They proceed through the 4th and 3rd sublevels of the facility, with two teams making their way to the same position to reach SCP-3580 on its path to the next stairway._
_SCP-3580 stops in its tracks on the 1st subfloor and pauses._
_Sigma-8's Alfa team, comprised of four agents, emerges from the three directions of the X intersection of the hallway several meters behind SCP-3580. They take aim._
**Agt. Duke:** SCP-3580, surrender, and get on the ground now!
_It does not turn to face them._
**SCP-3580:** Funny little men. Funny little toys.
> `Security systems in another wing of the facility note the presence of an anomaly on the loose.`
_Still not facing Duke's team, SCP-3580 crouches down._
_It maintains a fixed grip on the sword._
**Agt. Duke:** Fire!
_It leaps upward, clinging to the roof for a moment before it bounds from wall to wall and floor to ceiling in the opposite direction. After four strides, its next foothold gets shot out mid-bound, and it falls to the ground, engaging a thaumic barrier as it lands which blocks most of the bullets from this side._
**SCP-3580:** Funny, funny-
_The Bravo team enters the scene directly in front of it, with Captain Woodlock leading the charge. They open fire immediately, repeatedly hitting SCP-3580._
_It struggles as it creates another thaumic barrier in front of it. Both teams push in from each side, quickly closing in._
_Despite having taken several sedative rounds, SCP-3580 still clings to its sword as it attempts to stand, visibly struggling to do so. Woodlock commands both units to hold as he approaches. Agent Fallen follows beside him._
> `Security detects that the entity is swiftly approaching this hallway.`
_SCP-3580 rises to its feet, and stands, shakily, with its sword in hand._
**Cpt. Woodlock:** We gotcha.
_He removes his sidearm and shoots at its knee. It crumples down, clinging to its sword to hold it upright. Agent Fallen walks over to the downed SCP-3580._
> `Security monitoring personnel alert Captain Woodlock of the approaching threat. He turns his head to look down every end of the hall.`
**Cpt. Woodlock:** Crap. Everyone, positions; bodey incoming. Leon-
_He turns around to see Fallen standing over SCP-3580, barrel pointed at it._
**Agt. Fallen:** This is for my father.
**SCP-3580:** Which one was he?
_It chuckles lightly with a slight rasp._
**SCP-3580:** I honestly can't remember.
_He strikes it over the head with the butt of his gun._
**Cpt. Woodlock:** Whoa, kid, stop. Stop!
_Several operatives break formation and try to get a hold of Agent Fallen._
_SCP-3580-A smashes through the wall, sending bricks flying and knocking over Woodlock and Fallen. It opens fire, sweeping the left to right sides of the hall. Only three other operatives, besides Fallen and Woodlock, manage to hide behind cover in time._
_The entity takes SCP-3580's hand and lifts it up._
**SCP-3580:** Took you long enough, _Grand Warden_.
**SCP-3580-A:** Proxima, please-
**SCP-3580:** Shut it. Where's the damn thing?
**SCP-3580-A:** It's down several floors.
**SCP-3580:** Fine, Warden. Stairs are that way, get moving.
**SCP-3580-A:** Proxima, you are hurt. Please, let me help.
**SCP-3580:** This doesn't concern you, Grand Warden.
**SCP-3580-A:** Proxima-
**SCP-3580:** I said piss off.
_SCP-3580-A sighs, entering through the hole in the wall while watching where it steps as it passes by the corpses of three agents._
_SCP-3580 raises itself to stand, despite its numerous injuries, causing it to grumble. It walks over to Fallen, who lays on the floor coughing. It picks him up by the hair and looks him in the eye._
**SCP-3580:** Now, who did you say your daddy was again?
**Agt. Fallen:** You fucking-motherfuckin-
_It slams him into a wall, holding him up by the neck off the ground._
**SCP-3580:** That wasn't the answer I was looking for, boy.
_He stifles a sob._
**Agt. Fallen:** Site Director Malkin Fallen!
_As he speaks, he clenches his teeth._
**Agt. Fallen:** His name was Malkin Fallen, you fucking evil-
_It draws its blade._
**SCP-3580:** -Doesn't ring a bell.
_It brings its blade to his stomach, leaving a gash along its surface. Fallen shouts._
**SCP-3580:** There's not a whole lot I care for the people I encounter on these missions. Names for targets, maybe. Faces less likely. But otherwise, anyone who'll stand in my way is gonna be a fun little etching on my handle. A little treat for my practice, like your dear old pa.
_It brings its blade to his neck, drawing blood. He cringes, wincing._
**SCP-3580:** But I'm surely not going to remember any of your little soldiers here today as anything other than an interesting situation, and a stain to clean off my sword.
_It drags him further up the wall._
_It looks him in the eye, grinning._
**SCP-3580:** Especially not some whiney, hellbent brat playing pretend!
_It slashes through his leg, slicing it clean off. Fallen screams._
**SCP-3580-A:** You are no soldier. You are nothing.
_SCP-3580 tosses him across the hall. He crashes into a pile of rebar and upturned concrete while SCP-3580 leans its shoulder on the wall and begins laughing._
_Captain Woodlock struggles to stand upright. He pulls out his sidearm as he advances on SCP-3580, taking several shots at it which are all blocked by miniature thaumic barriers. He quickly runs out of ammo and tries to crawl back._
_It turns and walks casually toward him. Its sword drags across the wall, leaving a thick cut on its surface, as it brings the weapon over its head._
**SCP-3580:** This is… _this is how it feels_!
_SCP-3580 is stopped as its arm takes a .357 round, flailing it._
_Across the hall, Site Director Roufhous is seen walking towards them._
_Captain Woodlock backs away and tosses the pistol at SCP-3580. It catches the gun and crushes it in its hand as it refocuses on the Director. It reaches down to a device on its wrist._
**SCP-3580:** Cascade, hurry up down there.
_Director Roufhous gets in front of Woodlock, pocketing the revolver as they lean on their cane._
**Dir. Roufhous:** Mortimer, take Leonel to the infirmary.
_Woodlock with the help of another operative, hoists the bleeding Agent Fallen up and escorts him away from the conflict._
_SCP-3580 keeps its eyes on Roufhous._
**SCP-3580:** _Venator_. You're still alive.
**Dir. Roufhous:** We earned whatever you came here to reclaim.
**SCP-3580:** Really? And what about _my arms_?
_A sound reverberates through their electronic mask._
**Dir. Roufhous:** _Good luck with that._
_SCP-3580 takes two steps and launches itself towards them with a slash. They parry the hit with their cane. The skirmish continues with Roufhous pressing forward._
**Dir. Roufhous:** Weak. Uncoordinated. Slow.
_It brings down the katana on their cane, keeping it locked there. Roufhous pulls on the handle, revealing a hidden blade inside which they attack with. They land a strike on SCP-3580's head with the bottom end of the cane. It takes the hit before reorienting to deflect the oncoming blade._
**Dir. Roufhous:** Hmm. You love to torment humans. Can't even keep up the offense?
_It jumps and skips, launching off the wall to come down on them with a wide strike. They push back and up against it, and it arcs over and lands behind them._
**SCP-3580:** You have no right to say that, you bastard!
_SCP-3580 leaps forward in an instant._
_Roufhous swings, striking SCP-3580 in the arm, knocking the prosthetic and its sword away._
_It lands on its feet, grunting agitatedly, and spins around only to be struck in the side of the head by the metal handle of the cane. It slumps to the floor._
_Around the two, the remaining agents of Sigma-8 reveal themselves as the fight concludes._
_SCP-3580 speaks with a mild groan._
**SCP-3580:** After everything you did.
**Dir. Roufhous:** _I have every right_ , _witch_.
_They turn to face the two remaining operatives._
**Dir. Roufhous:** You lads handle her. Do not let her out of your sight.
_They disappear and instantly reappear.This is attributable to Director Roufhous' illusory anomaly. at the end of the hallway, pursuing SCP-3580-A._
* * *
Subsequently, SCP-3580-A made its way through several sublevels of the facility, later reaching the floor where all materials on GOI-850 had been stockpiled. Security systems showed it passing by several items of interest, instead moving to the back of the containment area and solely claiming one document contained within a canister.
It then proceeded to make its way back through the facility, avoiding contact with all personnel along its way, and was eventually confronted by Captain Woodlock. Attached below is the recording of that incident.
**Security log**
_SCP-3580-A is charging down a hallway, continuously bursting through shutting doors and reinforced gates with some effort. It holds the artifact close to its chest as it runs._
_As it breaks through another barrier, it is met with Captain Woodlock pointing his rifle at it. It stops._
**SCP-3580-A:** You. I hope your recovery was swift.
**Cpt. Woodlock:** It wasn't. In fact, it was pretty slow and it was pretty painful.
**SCP-3580-A:** I see. My deepest apologies.
**Cpt. Woodlock:** I don't accept. Put it down.
**SCP-3580-A:** You're severely outgunned here, my friend.
_A shotgun is racked, and its barrel is tapped against the back of SCP-3580-A's head._
**Dir. Roufhous:** Likewise.
**SCP-3580-A:** Deeply unfortunate.
**Cpt. Woodlock:** Yeah, I'd say that's about right. Now-
_It brings its arm forward first and slams its elbow into Roufhous, sending them backward. Woodlock takes several shots at it, which do not appear to penetrate its armor._
_It repositions to target Woodlock but is stopped as Roufhous stabs into SCP-3580-A's gun with their blade. It tries repeatedly to swat them off with its free hand to no avail. They aim their shotgun at its chest and take several shots in quick succession, causing it to stagger._
_SCP-3580-A manages to unjam its gun and brings it around to Woodlock._
_Woodlock aims the rifle at its face and takes a shot._
_The bullet pierces its frontal plating. It roars as it stumbles back._
_Roufhous gets down behind it and fires at the back of its knees._
_It falls on its back, cracking the linoleum floor beneath it, still clinging to the canister._
_Woodlock runs over and places his full weight on SCP-3580-A's gun. Roufhous kneels down, placing the barrel of the shotgun directly atop its head. Woodlock reaches down, grasping his radio._
**Cpt. Woodlock:** Boys, get down here now, Sub-7, Hall-8! Hurry!
**SCP-3580-A:** Greatly… unfortunate.
_It takes multiple deep breaths; the duration of these surpassing human capabilities._
**SCP-3580-A:** However, there is, perhaps, one problem.
_Woodlock levels his rifle at its head._
**Cpt. Woodlock:** Fuck you mean?
_A beep sounds from its wrist._
_It chuckles._
**SCP-3580-A:** Did you forget? She has with her some rather magical hands.
_A rift opens on the ceiling, and a bloodstained SCP-3580 falls through. In its singular remaining prosthetic, it carries its sword._
_As it falls, it kicks Woodlock sending him flying back, and stabs Roufhous in the torso, sending them to the floor. SCP-3580 laughs wildly._
**SCP-3580:** Pitiful! Just as pitiful as the rest!
_SCP-3580-A gets to its feet, struggling with its wounds._
**SCP-3580-A:** Proxima, enough. It is finished.
**SCP-3580:** I don't answer to you, Grand Warden.
**SCP-3580-A:** More than enough blood has been shed. We can leave now. We must leave now before more arrive.
**SCP-3580:** We can kill them too. It's of little concern.
_SCP-3580-A stomps, cracking the floor beneath it with a loud crash._
**SCP-3580-A:** Proxima, **enough**!
**Dir. Roufhous:** Oh, sure, you can kill them all if you resort to the lowliest of maneuvers, much like a child too afraid of serious confrontation!
_A sound echoes through their mask before SCP-3580 pulls its sword out. It takes the blade and strikes their mask, causing it to shatter and spill blood._
**SCP-3580-A:** Inquisitor Ramexe, open the gateway so that we may leave this place.
**SCP-3580:** Fine!
_It stands and creates a thaumic symbol with two fingers in the air. It draws an incantation, creating an elaborate rune of golden sparkling light that expands to a diameter roughly two meters long, its interior depicting another location._
**SCP-3580:** Satisfied, Warden?
**SCP-3580-A:** We leave. Do not delay.
_It steps through the portal and stands on the other end, awaiting SCP-3580. SCP-3580 looks down at Roufhous._
**SCP-3580:** Burn in Hell, _Venator_.
_Woodlock finally gets to his feet and aims his rifle at SCP-3580._
**Cpt. Woodlock:** Hold it!
_It looks over at him and laughs._
**SCP-3580:** We've been through this many times already; bullets won't work, little soldier.
_Woodlock pulls back the charging handle of the rifle._
**Cpt. Woodlock:** Think you're good enough to keep up two spells at once? You wanna take that chance with just the one hand?
_SCP-3580 crouches down. It is silent for several seconds._
**SCP-3580:** That child back there was cross with me, wasn't he? His father - he said the man was a manager of one of these branches.
**Cpt. Woodlock:** Site Director Malkin Fallen.
**SCP-3580:** That's the one. _Director_ , funny. Funny what kinds of honors they bestow upon you honorless batches of men. Junior, senior, lead researcher. Operative, agent, commander, _captain_.
**Cpt. Woodlock:** Kill that portal-
_It grabs Roufhous and hurls their body towards Woodlock, who holds his fire as he is knocked down._
_It dashes after the portal. Woodlock takes several wild shots at it, all miss. It makes it through and the portal closes right after._
**Cpt. Woodlock:** Son of a bitch!
_He looks around. Director Roufhous has disappeared._
* * *
The document stolen during this incident has been identified as half of an incantation capable of instantly transporting undefined amounts of matter from one location to another, at great expense to the caster. The remainder of this document beforehand remained unaccounted for.
The whereabouts of Site Director Roufhous are currently unknown. Assistant Director Samuel has assumed some of their duties over Area-55 in their absence.
Finding and containing SCP-3580 has been declared Priority Level ALPHA. The classification of this situation as a crisis is pending.

## **Addenda: 3580.5:**
* * *
On 12/3/1979, a search effort across all known anomalous channels began, attempting to locate SCP-3580. Since this time, no new activity has been noted for either entity, and their current location remains unknown. Retroactive investigations revealed several reports for both entities among other paranormal agencies, with accounts usually including violent depictions but lacked applicable information.
No throughline has been established with sightings of either anomaly, and few identifying details could be found. This venture is ongoing, and increased funds and resources have been allocated to this project; worldwide locating is ongoing, and the O5 Council has been alerted to this issue.
After the events of 11/3/1979, Agent Leonel Fallen was brought into intensive care and remained unconscious for a period of four days. He later awoke on the 15th and stabilized on the 20th. The operatives who died during that incident have been awarded Foundation Stars of Bravery, and their families have been notified and compensated.
**Internal log - Woodlock, Samuel, and Fallen dialogue**
_Agent Fallen is lying in a medical bed, Captain Woodlock at his side. Woodlock is looking down, stroking a photograph with his thumb. The image depicts the fully assembled Sigma-8._
**Fallen:** Both of them. At once.
**Woodlock:** Right when we had her.
**Fallen:** Just when I was about to…
**Woodlock:** You were out of line.
**Fallen:** But if I did manage to do it?
**Woodlock:** Then you'd be demoted.
**Fallen:** And the fat bastard wouldn't have escaped. Neither would _she_.
_Woodlock sighs, staring ahead blankly._
**Woodlock:** We blew it.
**Fallen:** If I was quicker to the trigger.
**Woodlock:** I could have positioned the team better. Prepared you all better.
_He puts his elbow on the table at his side and leans on it._
**Fallen:** The turnout would have been the same. You did all you could, sir.
**Woodlock:** It sure doesn't feel like it.
_The two are silent; the only noise heard is the beeping of the nearby machinery._
_A knocking is heard on the door. Woodlock stands up and walks over to open it, and Interim Director Samuel steps inside._
**Samuel:** Mortimer. Leon.
**Woodlock:** What do you want now?
**Samuel:** Besides the obvious, I wanted to discuss the future of Sigma-8. Perhaps we should do this in private.
**Fallen:** What's the damage?
**Samuel:** Fine then. Your team has proven highly ineffective in this case, Mortimer. Each deployment has displayed high casualties but no results. Higher-up, more professional task forces are being discussed for your replacement.
**Woodlock:** What's to be done with us?
**Samuel:** You will receive no further funding for augmentations, training, equipment, or otherwise. The remaining operatives will be reassigned, and they will have to forfeit their augments to cover the cost created by this experiment.
**Woodlock:** And myself?
**Samuel:** The Foundation has noticed that you showed exemplary bravery during the latest incident; going in without your team and living to tell the tale and all. You showed satisfactory professionalism during it, and your judgment did not appear to be overly influenced by your past. You will be reassigned to whatever task force takes over for this project.
**Fallen:** What about me?
**Samuel:** You displayed the opposite and acted aggressively and irrationally. You will be returned to junior research activities, and your enhancements will be surgically removed.
**Fallen:** _That thing cut off my fucking leg_!
**Samuel:** After you directly disclosed your personal history with it and attempted to terminate it without proper authorization.
**Fallen:** Termina- We haven't even contained it yet!
**Samuel:** And now that affair will be handled by more capable hands. The Foundation thanks you for your service and wishes you a swift recovery.
**Fallen:** Get out.
**Samuel:** Watch your tone, researcher.
_He turns to Woodlock._
**Samuel:** Mortimer, these are for you.
_He hands Woodlock a file of papers. After doing so, he collects a report from Fallen's bedframe and heads to the door, exiting the room._
_Woodlock briefly looks over the papers before tossing them over onto a nearby table._
**Woodlock:** They got bupkis.
**Fallen:** We worked for months to capture those two-
**Woodlock:** And they reassigned us when we just weren't fit for the job. I'm sure they'll put some real good teams on it, kid.
**Fallen:** And I'll never know with a shitty junior researcher clearance level.
**Woodlock:** It's in good hands now.
**Fallen:** We thought we were good hands at first too.
**Woodlock:** We did. We were. Maybe if we still had our mage…
**Fallen:** You don't seem all that phased that the fucker-
**Woodlock:** Quit swearing.
_Fallen huffs._
**Fallen:** That the fuckers who killed your team are just walking away scot-free right now!
**Woodlock:** _Knock it off_.
**Fallen:** While we sit here on our asses being told off by some dickhead in a suit who didn't lose shit his entire life, that bitch is out there killing and butchering and making some more orphans!
**Woodlock:** Agent Leonel-
**Fallen:** _Ex-agent_ , Captain!
_The Captain stands._
**Woodlock:** _Agent_ Leonel Maelstrom Fallen, shut your goddamned trap _for once!_
_Fallen leans up in bed. Woodlock takes several deep breaths._
**Woodlock:** Look, we both have problems. People are dead. You don't need to keep reminding me every five minutes just to support whatever bullshit point you're trying to make. Either move on or fall behind, but don't make me have to carry your shitty little emotions on my back as well!
**Woodlock:** Man up!
_He picks up the documents, walks to the door, and heads out._
_Fallen watches him leave. He visibly strains himself for a moment, thrashing his fists to a limited extent, before trying his best to turn away. His hands move over his face._
* * *
On 13/3/1979, MTF Sigma-8 ("Hellbound Cavalry") was disbanded. The remaining agents of it, namely operatives Fallen and Woodlock, have been reassigned. Authorization for the deployment of Tau-5 ("Samsara") is pending. Authorization for the deployment of Alpha-1 ("Red Right Hand") is pending.
Nu-7 ("Hammer Down") has been called in for the time being.
