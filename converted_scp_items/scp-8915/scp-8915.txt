 SCP-8915

Object Class:

 Neutralized

Special Containment Procedures:

 SCP-8915 passed away on 03/02/2012 at the age of 40 during a containment breach in Site-17. Her remains have been interred within a graveyard of her family's choosing, the name and location of which aren't to be disclosed on this page due to privacy concerns.

Description:

 SCP-8915 is the late Ayla Lynn, a field agent recruited by the Foundation's MTF Lambda-5 (“White Rabbits”) in 2009. SCP-8915 was designated as an anomaly on 16/12/2011.

The fingers on SCP-8915's right hand would contract whenever it was viewed by another individual. This movement appeared to be involuntary and reflexive. When in this state, SCP-8915 would lose control over the muscles of her right hand's fingers. The cause of this has never been understood, SCP-8915 had no neurological impairments but still reported to be unable to move her fingers when in this state, as if they were completely paralyzed. Her fingers could still be physically forced to move but reverted to their original position once physical contact was terminated.

When in this state, SCP-8915's little finger and ring finger would involuntarily curve but her middle finger, index finger and thumb would become erect. SCP-8915 reported this experience to be uncomfortable but not painful. SCP-8915 reported still having sensation in her fingers when in this state and would report the muscles of her fingers becoming more tired the more they were forced to stay in this position.

Despite her designation as an anomaly, SCP-8915 was allowed to resume her duties as a field agent as long as she agreed to conceal her right hand when in the presence of others. SCP-8915 continued serving under MTF Lambda-5 until her untimely death on the aforementioned date. She has been posthumously commended for her bravery, competence and loyalty to the Foundation.

 SCP-8915

Object Class:

 Neutralized

Special Containment Procedures:

 SCP-8915 was neutralized on 03/06/2011. Her family has been led to believe her remains have been interred within a graveyard of her family's choosing, the name and location of which are to be disclosed only to SCP-8915's immediate family members and Foundation personnel with Level 5 or higher access.

SCP-8915's body is to be embalmed and remain under constant surveillance within a vault 150 km below the surface of LoI-8915, which is an otherwise unremarkable site 1700 km away from the closest Foundation facility (Site-17).

Description:

 SCP-8915 is the late Ayla Lynn, a field agent recruited by the Foundation's MTF Lambda-5 (“White Rabbits”) in 2009. SCP-8915 was designated as an anomaly on 16/12/2011.

The fingers on SCP-8915's right hand would contract whenever it was viewed by another individual. This movement appeared to be involuntary and reflexive. When in this state, SCP-8915 would lose control over the muscles of her right hand's fingers. The cause of this has never been understood, SCP-8915 had no neurological impairments but still reported to be unable to move her fingers when in this state, as if they were completely paralyzed. Her fingers could still be physically forced to move but reverted to their original position once physical contact was terminated.

When in this state, SCP-8915's little finger and ring finger would involuntarily curve but her middle finger, index finger and thumb would become erect. SCP-8915 reported this experience to be uncomfortable but not painful. SCP-8915 reported still having sensation in her fingers when in this state and would report the muscles of her fingers becoming more tired the more they were forced to stay in this position.

SCP-8915 was regarded as an asset with immense potential for the Foundation prior to her unplanned neutralization on the aforementioned date. This was because it was believed SCP-8915 had the ability to grant any request regardless of its implausibility. The extent of control possessed by SCP-8915 over this ability is unknown.

Log of Interview with SCP-8915, 17/12/2011

Interviewed:

 SCP-8915

Interviewing:

 Lieutenant Harley Hussain, MTF Lambda-5

[BEGIN LOG]

Hussain:

 So, any idea why this happened?

SCP-8915:

 Nope. I can't help it. It's kinda like that thing when a doctor hits your knee and it jerks. It just happens when somebody looks at it.

Hussain:

 Can't you at least try to resist the urge?

SCP-8915:

 It's not an urge. Like I said, it's more like a knee-jerk or a gag reflex. I don't want to do it but there is no way to not do it.

Hussain:

 Have you even tried to hold it back, you know, try to suppress it? Ever?

SCP-8915:

 I'm sorry, do you know what a reflex is? Of course I tried to hold it back, it's simply not possible. I suppose you have to have it yourself to understand what it's like.

Hussain:

 So, it's an anomalous reflex?

SCP-8915:

 Yes! Finally.

Hussain:

 That's interesting. How does this reflex get triggered?

SCP-8915:

 Whenever somebody else than me looks at my right hand. It doesn't happen when I look at it. See?

SCP-8915 removes her right hand from the underside of the table and shows it to Lieutenant Hussain. Two of her fingers curve instantly.

Hussain:

 Damn. That was fast.

SCP-8915:

 Told you.

Hussain:

 That definitely looks to be an anomaly. No one can move their fingers that fast.

2

SCP-8915:

 Yeah, it feels really weird. Unnatural. And it gets a bit uncomfortable if someone looks at it for too long.

SCP-8915 lowers her hand.

Hussain:

 Huh. So that's it?

SCP-8915:

 You tell me. Do you have any other questions?

Hussain:

 Wait, do you have nothing else to add? Is that it? Your special ability is raising your fingers ultra fast whenever someone looks at 'em?

SCP-8915:

 My special ability? What are you talking about?

Hussain:

 It's just that when they told me you developed anomalous abilities, I… came here expecting… more. I know it's unprofessional and… frankly, just plain immature but I can't believe the only reason you're an SCP now is because of… that.

SCP-8915 shrugs.

SCP-8915:

 I guess they decided I was barely anomalous enough to warrant an SCP designation. Barely.

Hussain:

 But this is… It's nothing! Do they classify people as 

anomalous items

 because-

SCP-8915:

 That's what I also thought! Why even bother classifying me as an SCP, am I right? What do they even think, that I can change reality or stop time or something?

Hussain:

 Can you?

SCP-8915 scoffs.

SCP-8915:

 What do you think?

Hussain:

 No?

SCP-8915:

 No.

Hussain:

 Well then, I think it's a funny coincidence only three of your fingers stay up.

SCP-8915:

 Huh?

Hussain:

 You know how the fairy tale goes.

SCP-8915's eyes widen in realization and she grins.

SCP-8915:

 You're right! That is funny!

SCP-8915 raises her right hand and her fingers curve involuntarily.

SCP-8915:

 Wanna make a wish? See what happens?

Hussain:

 I know you mean that as a joke but-

SCP-8915:

 I wish Kim Jong Il's head would explode! Right now!

SCP-8915's ring finger contracts and curves.

SCP-8915:

 Ah shit.

Hussain:

 What the hell is wrong with you?

SCP-8915:

 Did that do something?

Hussain:

 Did you do that on purpose?

SCP-8915:

 No. Absolutely not.

Hussain:

 God 

FUCKING

 damn it, Ayla!

SCP-8915:

 What? We don't know if that did something!

3

 Yet.

Hussain:

 You. Fucking. Amateur.

SCP-8915:

 I'm really sorry but with all due respect, I think you're overreacting right now.

Hussain:

 I need to report this. We need to report this!

Lieutenant Hussain gets up from his chair and runs to the door.

[END LOG]

Afterword:

 After being asked why she chose to make this wish, SCP-8915 stated she wasn't being genuine and the only reason she said Kim Jong Il's name was "[he] was the first evil douchebag who came to [her] mind".

 Lieutenant Harley Hussain, MTF Lambda-5

[BEGIN LOG]

SCP-8915 is restrained on a bed with leather straps. She is staring at the ceiling. A memetic construct that prevents the vibration of vocal cords except when it's done for breathing has been applied to her to prevent her from using her anomalous ability. Lieutenant Hussain enters. Only two of SCP-8915's right hand's fingers are curved this time.

Hussain:

 Oh no.

Hussain takes a seat next to SCP-8915. SCP-8915's expression changes upon seeing him and she begins to struggle against her restraints.

Hussain:

 Ayla, Ayla, please. This wasn't my suggestion. Yeah, taking away your voice was my idea but I don't understand why they went this far.

SCP-8915 stops struggling. A single tear drop streams down her right eye.

Hussain:

 Please, Ayla, don't cry. I've seen you on the field. I know you're stronger than that. I assure you, this is just a temporary measure.

Hussain looks at the door to the room and shouts.

Hussain:

 Bring him in.

D-7159 is escorted into the room by a security guard. Hussain draws his weapon.

Hussain:

 Do it now. If you deviate from protocol, you will be reprimanded severely.

D-7159 raises his left hand and pretends to be holding an object.

D-7159:

 I wish for a 20 cm tall, glass cup full of strawberry flavored milkshake to appear in my left hand.

Nobody in the room makes a sound for ten seconds.

Researcher Flynn | Intercom:

 This test has been deemed a failure. Cease testing. Escort D-7159 out of the room. Lieutenant Hussain is to stay in the room and execute secondary testing protocol as predetermined. Proceed now.

The security guard hands a paper and pencil she was holding to Lieutenant Hussain. The security guard and D-7159 exit. Lieutenant Hussain sighs and places the objects on SCP-8915's abdomen.

Hussain:

 Alright Ayla. I'm going to undo these straps on your arms now. Please, please, 

please

 don't do anything stupid.

SCP-8915 affirmatively shakes her head. Hussain begins undoing the straps on SCP-8915's right arm. Once free, SCP-8915's right arm starts to shake. Hussain proceeds to undo the straps on SCP-8915's left arm. As he does so, SCP-8915 balls her left hand into a fist. Once free, SCP-8915's left hand also starts shaking.

Hussain:

 Don't be scared. They had you do similar stuff before as well. You know how this goes. Rise up. Slowly.

SCP-8915 straightens her upper body, using her arms as support.

Hussain:

 Now grab that pencil with your left hand.

SCP-8915 complies.

Hussain:

 Very good, very good. Now, write the words I speak to you in English, verbatim. Verbatim, Ayla. Do you understand?

SCP-8915 affirmatively shakes her head.

Hussain:

 First letter capitalized. I wish-

SCP-8915 writes the words down.

Hussain:

 -for a 20 cm tall, comma, glass cup full of strawberry flavored milkshake-

SCP-8915 writes the words down.

Hussain:

 -to appear in my left hand.

SCP-8915 finishes writing, lets go of the pencil and raises her left arm similar to how D-7159 did. For five seconds, nobody in the room makes a sound.

An approximately 20 cm long glass cup filled with strawberry milkshake, with a diameter of around 5 cm, materializes inside SCP-8915's left hand. It instantly penetrates the back and palm of her hand simultaneously. SCP-8915's right hand's index finger curves involuntarily. She attempts to scream and starts thrashing violently.

Hussain:

 Motherfucker!

Researcher Flynn | Intercom:

 Testing aborted. Lieutenant Hussain, exit the room immediately.

Hussain:

 She needs medical attention!

Researcher Flynn | Intercom:

 The paramedics are already here. Exit the room immediately or you will be reprimanded.

Hussain locks eyes with SCP-8915 for a second, then runs out of the room as the paramedics enter to attend to SCP-8915's injuries.

O5-5

[BEGIN LOG]

SCP-8915 is sitting in a fetal position at the southeastern corner of the chamber. All of the other objects in the room have been removed to minimize the risk of SCP-8915 committing suicide. Two men enter, pushing a rolling desk with a computer monitor on it. SCP-8915 stares at them with teary eyes. The men push the rolling desk until it is centimeters away from SCP-8915. As they come closer, SCP-8915 recoils and shields her face with her hands. At this moment, it can be seen all but one of the fingers of her right hand are curved.

The men stop pushing the desk and exit together. Seconds later, O5-5 enters. They approach SCP-8915 and stop right next to the monitor. SCP-8915 stops shielding her face and stares at O5-5.

O5-5:

 Hello, Ayla. I am sincerely sorry about all of this. In our defense, everyone on both the Council and the Committee were fucking terrified when you obliterated the supreme leader of North Korea. Because of our constrained relations with the DPRK, that incident was… especially costly to cover up.

O5-5 crouches.

O5-5:

 But I believe you deserve better than this. You haven't been with us for too long but I have seen your dossier and I think you're an exceptional agent.

O5-5 extends an arm to wipe away SCP-8915's tears.

O5-5:

 It took months, it was an absolute living hell up there at Site-01, trust me. Endless meetings, debates, paperwork, arguments with Committee members. But we reached a verdict. Everything is going to be okay soon, Ayla. The nightmare's about to stop, I promise you.

O5-5 stands up.

O5-5:

 But first, you must look at the screen.

O5-5 boots up the monitor by pressing the start-up button at its bottom right corner. SCP-8915 averts her gaze from the screen and shields her face again.

O5-5:

 Ayla. Ayla, please. What do you want? Amnestics? We can do that. I promise you, you won't remember any of this once we're done and you can continue your life as normal. Ayla? Look at the screen, Ayla.

SCP-8915 doesn't comply with O5-5's order.

O5-5:

 Look at the screen, Ms. Lynn.

SCP-8915 refuses to comply with O5-5's order once again.

O5-5:

 SCP-8915. I won't ask again. Look. At. The screen.

SCP-8915 reluctantly lowers her arms. She opens her eyes and sees what's on the screen. It's a cognitohazardous image, which nullifies the effect of the memetic construct applied to her. SCP-8915 immediately realizes she can now produce sounds and attempts to speak. However, she is still incapable of forming coherent words.

SCP-8915:

 

(unintelligible)

O5-5:

 Don't bother. You can only say what I permit you to stay. I just need you to say a bunch of words I want you to say and then, I'll permit you to say anything you want. You'll be able to speak again and we can both just… take a fucking break from this shitshow. It's not as if I like doing this to you.

SCP-8915:

 (

unintelligible

)

O5-5:

 Now.

O5-5 reaches into their jacket and takes out a tablet. They start reading from it.

O5-5:

 I wish for all members of the iteration of the SCP Foundation's O5 Council who exist in the dimension I exist in to spontaneously gain knowledge of how they can make the SCP Foundation successful in its mission of ensuring no person living on the planet Earth who doesn't already know of the existence of supernatural phenomenons, entities and objects ever finds out about the existence of supernatural phenomenons, entities and objects, every anomalous phenomenon already contained by the Foundation to and yada, yada, yada.

O5-5 extends the tablet to SCP-8915.

O5-5:

 We wanted to make our wish as comprehensive as possible, to leave no stone unturned. We wouldn't want to cause another milkshake incident of an infinitely larger scale.

SCP-8915 takes the tablet from O5-5.

O5-5:

 I permit you to read everything written on this device out loud but only if you start reading out loud from the first word and do not stop reading out loud until you've read all of it. You can start now, but be warned. Now that I said that, you won't physically be able to stop reading once you start. The volume of your voice isn't important as long as I can hear you. Reading that in its entirety takes about one hour and forty three minutes, so good luck. You can have a glass of water once you're done. And, uh, also, once you're done reading that you will have my permission to say whatever you want, as much as you want to. Promise.

O5-5 sits down on the floor in front of SCP-8915.

O5-5:

 Go ahead.

[REDACTED FOR BREVITY]

SCP-8915 reads the last word of the text. She is visibly sweating and tired from constantly speaking for 1 hour and 43 minutes. She grabs her throat and falls over.

O5-5:

 You did it! And you didn't mess anything up! It worked! Did it work? I-

O5-5 suddenly grabs their head and groans in pain.

O5-5:

 

WHAT IS THIS?

O5-5 stands up and starts moving toward the room's door, limping.

O5-5:

 

GET ME OUT OF HERE! WHOSE VOICE IS THIS?

A man enters the room, visibly concerned.

The Man:

 Sir! Sir? Are you-

O5-5:

 

WHO THE FUCK IS THAT? WHO ARE YOU?

The Man:

 I'm your bodyguard, sir! Are you in need of any-

O5-5 suddenly ceases screaming and composes themselves. O5-5 adjusts their tie.

O5-5:

 Oh. Sorry, I didn't recognize you.

The Man:

 Sir?

O5-5 turns back to look at SCP-8915. SCP-8915 raises her right hand to show O5-5 her thumb has curved. She points at her mouth with her left hand.

O5-5:

 It really did work, after all.

O5-5 turns again to face the bodyguard.

O5-5:

 I'm okay now.

O5-5 draws their firearm and fires at the side of their head in an attempt to commit suicide. The attempt 

fails

 and O5-5 collapses on the floor, convulsing violently.

[END LOG]

Afterword:

 Following the conclusion of this interview, a mass attempted suicide incident occurred at Site-01. The only people involved were members of the O5 Council. The Ethics Committee organized an emergency meeting per the order of Chairman Odongo Tejani. MTF Omega-1 ("Law's Left Hand") was deployed to collect the bodies of the Overseers.

Two of O5-5's former personal bodyguards who were at the scene of O5-5's attempted suicide were sent orders from the Ethics Committee to oversee the transportation of SCP-8915 to the medical wing of Site-17.

Once the two agents entered the chamber where the incident had taken place, one of the agents (Reuben Jones)

4

 shot and killed the other (Alan Mooney). He then procured a Bowie knife from his possessions and assaulted SCP-8915. SCP-8915 showed no resistance as Jones attempted to sever her right hand using the knife and she even started smiling once she seemingly recognized the face of Lieutenant Hussain.

Jones was shot in the left leg by on-site security guard Agent Kayla Mills before he could sever SCP-8915's hand from the wrist. He immediately committed suicide via firearm upon being shot. On-site paramedics arrived soon after and attended to SCP-8915's injuries. SCP-8915 expired from massive physical trauma and blood loss before she could be taken to Site-17's medical wing.

SCP-8915's corpse does not possess anomalous properties. Thus, SCP-8915 has been reclassified to Neutralized. The Ethics Committee's investigation into the events of 03/02/2012 (colloquially known as "302") is ongoing.
