The remains of SCP-7585.
  
  
**Special Containment Procedures:** The urn containing SCP-7585's ashes is kept in a standard storage locker at Site-17. Cultures of anomalous bacterial and fungal matter previously generated by SCP-7585 are maintained in on-site biological labs and should be handled according to Class-3 Biohazard protocols.  
  
  
**Description:** SCP-7585 expired in September 1998 from toxic shock after becoming infected by an anomalously modified species of _Staphylococcus_. The body was cremated; the ashes show no anomalous properties. Several bacterial strains related to SCP-7585 are cultivated for their enzymes or byproducts. These strains have no anomalous properties aside from their origin.
