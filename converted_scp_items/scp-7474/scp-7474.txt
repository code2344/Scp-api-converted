Addendum 7474-2: Surveillance Report

Between 12/4/2023 and 31/7/2023 approximately 670 559 individuals between the ages of 3 and 7 have died due to rapid bodily deterioration. Observed symptoms include, but are not limited to:

Rapid decrease of muscle mass

Deterioration of bone structure

Weakened blood coagulation

Rapid shedding of skin tissue

Gastric ulcers and expulsion of gastric fluids.

Large majority of human population believes the symptoms are the cause of an unidentified disease, and the Foundation will strive to uphold that belief.

Most countries attempt to contain mass hysteria amongst their citizens to varying decrees of success, with some resorting in the declaration of martial law to contain the resulting damage to human lives and infrastructure. Means to combat psychological harm on a massive scale are currently underway.

Investigation taking place within the week following the initially reported cases resulted in the discovery of common factors between each individual. Autopsy confirmed the presence of a tag attached to the tailbone, with each one having the text "Humon

TM

" printed on them. Additionally the parents of each individual were confirmed to have struggled with infertility prior to the conception of the child. Further study is ongoing.
