"When she died, everyone was in tears. My sister, my father, my whole family. But I felt no sorrow, no anger. She was just another statistic, a face in a sea of dead bodies."
**Item #:** SCP-8151
**Object Class:** Thaumiel[1](javascript:;)
**Special Containment Procedures:** Any external manifestations of SCP-8151 are to be recorded and sent to the Temporal Anomalies wing at Site-34. Foundation personnel who witness manifestations of SCP-8151 may not, regardless of clearance level, receive amnestic treatment until after the events portrayed either come to pass or are circumvented. Failure to comply with these restrictions will result in mandatory amnestic treatment.
D-Class assigned to SCP-8151 locations are to be provided adequate provisions as per Document 422341-CA[2](javascript:;). Staff assigned to monitor SCP-8151 locations must be given bi-weekly psychiatric evaluations. Any staff obtaining lower than a 50 on the Düren-Henderssohn Psychological Stability Scale[3](javascript:;) must be reassigned.  
  
The previous procedure is under review by the Ethics Committee.
Personnel assigned to official SCP-8151 locations must comply with all Delphi event regulations, including cooperation with the GOC in disseminating only relevant and necessary information to participating world governments. Due to the often time-restrictive nature of SCP-8151, Foundation emergency response teams are to remain on standby 24 hours a day.
**Description:** SCP-8151 is a standard single-hung 24" x 36" domestic window. SCP-8151 can manifest in any enclosed, windowless room up to 15 sq meters in size. It will not manifest in rooms that are not of a standard (rectangular or circular) shape.
Manifestations of SCP-8151 are labeled as "Delphi" events. During Delphi events, SCP-8151 will materialize on a wall within the room, displaying vague, foggy patterns and shapes on the window for approximately five minutes. If a sentient being is not present within that time, the window will de-manifest and the Delphi event will cease. If a sentient being is present, the image outside the window will spontaneously shift to depict a current or near-future tragedy, typically of anomalous origin.[4](javascript:;) Depictions are highly detailed and graphic, often involving catastrophic loss of life and/or severe harm to human persons.
Prior to 2013, the disasters depicted during Delphi events were determined to be roughly 50% ongoing crises with no possibility for Foundation or GOC intervention that could mitigate damage. The implementation of thaumaturgic spatio-temporal focusing rituals, developed by Dr. Tilda Moose, allowed Foundation thaumaturgists to filter out ongoing disasters and only depict future ones. This also allowed for Foundation thaumaturges to specify certain locations where Delphi events were exponentially more likely to occur. There are currently 18 Sites, with Site-34’s Temporal Anomalies wing being the central location, designated for Delphi events under Foundation control.
**Addendum 1 - Preliminary Trial of SCP-8151:**
Before deployment as a full Thaumiel-Class anomaly, SCP-8151 was set to undergo a series of preliminary testing to determine its efficacy and ease of use. Researchers Meredith Polletta and David Cross were promoted to Senior Researchers and tasked with helping to oversee the trials. They were selected for their naturally very high psychological and cognitive resilience.
Parameters for testing were selected to show low potential for loss of life with moderate to severe structural and financial damages. Volunteer D-Class were used as subjects for viewing SCP-8151 during Delphi events.
**Test 1:**  
**Event:** Monsoon flooding on Tioman Island, Malaysia  
**Expected Losses:** 15 dead, 7 missing, $3,000,000 USD  
**Results:** Island and surrounding areas were evacuated fully, protective seawall and storm borders reinforced. Damages not expected to exceed $100,000 USD.  
**Comments:**  
_Polletta: Finally some recognition around here. About time we started doing something actually useful._  
_Cross: Just hope that this promotion doesn’t lead to all that extra paperwork._
**Test 2:**  
**Event:** Very late season tornado striking Columbia, Missouri, US  
**Expected Losses:** 3 dead, $500,000 USD, 1 Foundation Auxiliary Site  
**Results:** Foundation weather drones deployed. Unexpected cold front dispersed before severe weather could form.  
**Comments:**  
_Cross: Huh. Wonder why we don’t do that kind of thing more often. It could certainly help a lot of people._  
_Polletta: Ozzie says the devices are extremely expensive and work in an extremely short range over an extremely short period of time._  
_Cross: Well that sounds a bit-_  
_Polletta: I swear to God._  
_Cross: Can’t I have a little fun every now and then?_  
_Cross: Ok, fine. You know, if we keep doing this well, maybe the Foundation will start deploying more drones like these. We could really start saving lives._
**Test 10:**  
**Event:** Minor eruption of Mauna Kea, Hawaii  
**Expected Losses:** 9 dead, $10,000,000 USD, 2 Foundation research outposts, 1 GOC base  
**Results:** Preemptive negotiations with local thaumaturgic flora and fauna resulted in a redirection of lava flow away from settled areas.  
**Comments:**  
_Cross: I think we’re starting to get the hang of this._  
_Polletta: Even the D-Class are getting into it. I heard one of them talking about setting up a schedule so everyone gets a fair share._  
_Cross: Was it Attleburgh? D-438249?_  
_Polletta: …maybe. Hey, listen, just because he’s weird doesn’t make it invalid!_  
_Cross: Sure, sure._
Following a series of successful trials, SCP-8151 was approved for deployment as a Thaumiel-class anomaly.  
  
  
**Addendum 2- Record of Major Delphi Events:**
Following the ratification of the Treaty of Athens, a research hub was established at Site-34. Senior Researchers Meredith Polletta and David Cross were named as Project Co-leads. The following is a record of major disasters predicted by SCP-8151 at Site-34 up to December 31st, 2017. (Note: this list does not encompass every disaster predicted, only those with high potential for loss of life)
Date | Description of Event | Notes From Project Leads | Predicted Losses | Actual (Estimated) Losses  
---|---|---|---|---  
5-21-13; 2 hr prior to event | Several people are shown being swept away into floodwaters contaminated with heavy and dangerous debris. One person collides with a mass of trees and stone and is thrust under the water. | **Cross:** _The level of detail the window shows is astounding, but the sounds are a little…unnerving at times._  
**Polletta:** _Wish it would give us more lead time, but beggars can’t be choosers, I guess._ | 2,500 | 1,000  
7-04-13; 3.5 hr prior to event | Containment breach of SCP-████. A small town in Iowa, USA is shown being leveled. The window zooms in on the anomaly breaking into a local corner store and ripping apart the people within. | **Polletta:** _Thank god we got the alert when we did._  
**Cross:** _Jesus. Makes you feel like all this is worth it?_ | 3,000 | 700  
9-03-13; 1 hr prior to event | A building shakes during an earthquake. Multiple screams can be heard as the building collapses. D-14790 attempts to leave partially through the event, causing de-manifestation. | **Cross:** _I didn’t know his family was in that village…_ | 10,000 | 5,000  
10-12-13; 6 hr prior to event | An underground anomalous market is engulfed in a shimmering blue fire. Bodies are shown alive in various states of burning, most of which should be deceased, based on damage sustained. D-14790 stands up after 30 seconds, runs headfirst into the window and must be restrained by on-Site personnel | **Polletta:** _…shit_  
**Cross:** _These people aren’t dead yet, ok? We just gotta do our thing and we can save them. That’s our job._  
**Polletta:** _If you say so._ | 700 | `[REDACTED]`  
  
D-14790 received psychiatric treatment and was removed from the project. D-53458 was selected as a replacement. At least 4 research personnel are now required to be directly on-site as mediators and observers during a Delphi event. The Ethics Committee recommends the retirement of SCP-8151 sites.

Senior Researcher David Cross: 93  
Senior Researcher Meredith Polletta: 95  
  

1-02-14; 4 hr prior to event | [SCP-179](/scp-179) points towards the Sun. A massive solar flare races to Earth, lighting up the atmosphere with electromagnetic interference. The window zooms into a small town. The residents all point at the aurora in the sky, before a plane is seen colliding with the ground. | **Polletta:** _How the hell do we prepare for that?!_  
**Cross:** _Happy fuckin New Year._ | 136,000 | 78  
---|---|---|---|---  
3-15-14; 1 hr prior event | A large cruise ship is capsized somewhere in open waters while a storm rages around it. People are heard screaming and several are jumping from the ship as it tilts further. As the ship begins to sink, lightning strikes the water and the screams go silent. | **Polletta:** _Paul quit today._  
**Cross:** _I saw. Exit interview?_  
**Polletta:** _Probably gonna be on us. He's like the third guy this week_ | 2,500 | 1,000  
  
D-Class are no longer permitted to view Delphi events. Site staff will now rotate to maintain around-the-clock monitoring of SCP-8151 locations.

**Cross:** First off, thank you for agreeing to this. We, uh, read your resignation. I guess there's nothing we can offer you to change your mind.
**McNamera:** …no. Nothing.
**Polletta:** Before we start with our questions, do you have any questions for us?
_McNamera shakes his head._
**Polletta:** Alright then. We'll get the big one out of the way first. Was there any event or situation in particular that pushed you to resign?
_McNamera sits in silence for a few seconds._
**McNamera:** I dunno. It all kinda fused together eventually.
**Polletta:** Are there any external factors that contributed to your decision?
**McNamera:** I wasn't sleeping well. My girlfriend said I started randomly crying recently and it freaked her out. It didn't sound like crying, but it looked like it.
_Polletta nods._
**Cross:** What did you particularly like about this position? What would you say was the best part?
_McNamera looks up at him. McNamera's eyes have dark circles under them and he looks pale._
**McNamera:** You know, I really thought we were helping people.
_Cross and Polletta exchange glances._
**Cross:** We can take a break if you want-
**McNamera:** I think it was the motorcycler that got me. The sound of him hitting that truck as the bike went under. That's what keeps me up at night.
**Polletta:** Paul-
**McNamera:** And actually, I do have a question.
**Cross:** …go ahead.
**McNamera:** How the hell do you people keep at this?

_When he gets home, he dreads turning on the news. The crash is violent. Suspected drugs and alcohol. No survivors. He begins to sob._
_Despite everything, the project continues. Reassignment to Site-34's Temporal Anomalies wing soon becomes Foundation shorthand for severe disciplinary action. No one really ever dies there, it’s just an excuse for the Foundation to hole-punch the hell out of your brain and ship you off somewhere more useful.

_I showed up at her house late, not that it mattered. I knew pretty much exactly what I would find there. The front door was probably open, but I didn’t feel right just barging in. I had to knock on the side door three times. The first one she probably didn’t hear, the second she probably thought was a hallucination. I didn’t even finish the third before the door opened._
_"What?"_
_I couldn’t really see her well in the dark, but she sounded worse than the last time we’d spoke._
_"Can I come in?"_
_"What are you, a fuckin‘ vampire?" Her voice curdled in irritation. "Sorry, sorry. It’s been…"_
_"I know."_
_"Watch out for boxes n‘ shit."_
_Once my eyes adjusted, I got a better look at the inside of Meredith‘s house. It looked almost identical to mine. The windows had all been taped over, empty pill bottles on the floor. Neither of us left a lot of trash, since we hadn’t had much of an appetite lately, but she had more bottles lying around than I did. She lit another candle, and I wasn’t sure if it was the light or if her skin really had become that yellow._
_"Well? You’re here for a reason, right?"_
_I nodded and took a breath. The candles didn’t do much to mask the smell of someone rotting away._  
_"Council‘s voting again."_
_She stared at me with somehow less emotion than she had before._  
_"That might be the biggest waste of breath you’ve ever used."_
_"I just thought you deserved to know. They might shut it down this time."_
_A flicker of rage crossed her eyes._  
_"So?? What the fuck do I care? Is that gonna fix me? Fix you? Fuck the council." She stood up and walked to her kitchen, her back to me. "Why are you here, David?" The brief flash of emotion dissipated almost as quick as it had arisen._
_While her back was turned, I pulled a container from my bag and slapped it on the counter._
_"If I turn around that better be drugs or a gun." She turned. "Huh, what do you know. It is drugs."_
_"Amnestics."_
_She rolled her eyes. "You really are fuckin‘ stupid."_
_Her expression shifted from disdain, to confusion, to intrigue as I pulled out one container after another._
_"Where did you get all these?"_
_"Doesn’t matter, it’s enough to forget."_
_"Forget what?"_
_"Everything. Site-34, the Foundation, everything. We start over, completely. Or it kills us. Either way, we’ll be free."_
_I started to divide up the pills. Meredith looked like she was about to cry._
_"Really?" Her voice cracked._
_"Wanna find out? Together?"_
_We raised our cups to each other._
_"To the future?"_
