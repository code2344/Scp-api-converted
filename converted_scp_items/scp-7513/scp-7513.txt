Item #:

 SCP-7513

Object Class:

 Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:

 SCP-7513 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-13. Access to SCP-7513 is restricted to humans with Level 4 access or above.

Site-13 is not to be used for any mission involving extraterrestrials. Staff at Site-13 are to be vetted for any extraterrestrial DNA, while staff working with SCP-7513 are to be intensely monitored for any sign of extraterrestrial influence via monthly check-ins and daily self-testing.

Description:

 SCP-7513 is Forrest O‚ÄôSullivan, a 25-year-old male of Irish-American descent.

SCP-7513 has an anomalously high encounter rate with sapient extraterrestrial entities, with most reported encounters ending with zero casualties, and the species that said extraterrestrial entity originates from having an amicable relationship with humans from that point on.

Interactions between extraterrestrials and SCP-7513 are almost always sexual, with entities offering SCP-7513 to partake in customary courting rituals or to engage in casual sexual activity. When encountering species that are asexual, or have no intention of copulating with SCP-7513, the actions and words of said entities are usually interpreted as flirtatious by SCP-7513.

Before containment, SCP-7513 was involved in 13% of incidents regarding Foundation encounters with extraterrestrial species in the past 20 years, the earliest of which being in 2003. Of these incidents that SCP-7513 was involved in, 51% of them have ended with a diplomatic relationship being established between the Foundation and said extraterrestrial species. The other 49% resulted in no further activity being reported from these extraterrestrial species.

SCP-7513 was discovered on August 5th, 2021 during Incident 7513-1. SCP-7513 was one of the individuals interrogated for the incident, and upon the investigation of its Tinder account, it was discovered that 75% of all the accounts it had matched with were accounts flagged by Foundation webcrawlers as belonging to undercover extraterrestrials (henceforth referred to as UEs). An investigation into its other social media accounts revealed that:

59% of all of SCP-7513‚Äôs Twitter followers were accounts belonging to UEs.

77% of Facebook groups that SCP-7513 had joined were being run entirely by UEs, sometimes with SCP-7513 being the only human in said groups.

95% of SCP-7513‚Äôs Instagram followers were accounts belonging to UEs, with 100% of comments found under posts made by SCP-7513 belonging to said accounts.

Following this investigation, as well as the discovery of his involvement in prior Foundation incidents, SCP-7513 was informed of its anomalous properties and willingly entered containment.

alright then‚Ä¶

The Foundation was investigating an unrelated string of anomalous disappearances when hume levels dropped significantly around the area of the Holden Club, equivalent to hume levels in the presence of an extraterrestrial spacecraft.

Command approved for the operatives to set up around the Holden Club due to a rise in extraterrestrial deaths in Wisconsin, and three agents were stationed inside.

Due to the hastiness of this operation, the agents were not properly prepared, and didn‚Äôt have standard-issue lapel cameras on hand. Fortunately, SCP-7513 was recording the incident on its phone, the transcription can be read below.

[BEGIN LOG]

<Camera feed starts, it is a closeup of SCP-7513‚Äôs face>

SCP-7513:

 Okay, I‚Äôm recording. I‚Äôm making this for uhhh‚Ä¶ evidence? Might get murdered tonight and I‚Äôm kinda scared about that.

<It sighs>

SCP-7513:

 Listen, I like Georgie, but she seems, I don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶ too good to be true? I have a bad feeling about this.

<It pauses, wiping its forehead of sweat>

SCP-7513:

 Maybe it‚Äôs because she‚Äôs the only real person who contacted me after all of these ghostings and uh‚Ä¶ people pretending to be aliens, yannow?

<SCP-7513 takes multiple deep breaths in and out.>

SCP-7513:

 Alright‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm ready‚Ä¶

<SCP-7513 puts the camera in its pocket, covering the view partially>

SCP-7513:

 I‚Äôm just gonna be cheesy about it, yeah? This is a fake flower that sprays water‚Ä¶ yeah‚Ä¶ yeah‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm just a funny guy, playing a lil joke, haha.

<SCP-7513 exits its car and enters the Holden Club, immediately making its way over to the rear of the building>

<Camera shakes as SCP-7513 approaches the back wall and walks nearby it, scanning the crowd for POI-481>

SCP-7513:

 Georgie?

<Redacted for brevity. The following five minutes consist of SCP-7513 searching for POI-481, and asking other people about POI-481‚Äôs whereabouts.>

SCP-7513:

 God damn, where i-

???:

 I‚Äôve been waiting for ya, darlin~!

<Camera shakes, a brief shot of a gigantic hornet (POI-481) bursting through the walls of the Holden Club is shown.>

SCP-7513:

 HOLY SHIT!

<Chaos erupts within the building, as many of the attendees, SCP-7513 included, attempt to flee the scene.>

<SCP-7513 takes out its phone and holds it on POI-481 as it flies through the air. The embedded Foundation agents take out their firearms and fire at the entity. Several civilians take out weapons and attempt to take it down>

SCP-7513:

 JESUS FUCKING CHRIST!

<POI-481 flies at SCP-7513, picking it up and flying into the air. The footage is shaky footage of the club‚Äôs wall.>

POI-481:

 Heya, Forrest~. Glad you could make it~!

SCP-7513:

 GEORGIE!?

POI-481:

 Hiya, hun~!

<POI-481 giggles>

SCP-7513:

 Shit‚Ä¶ fuck‚Ä¶ fuck! FUCK!! PUT ME DOWN!!

POI-481:

 No can do, hun~. Got a queen that needs a king.

<Audio is drowned out by a loud droning noise. This coincides with the arrival of an extraterrestrial spacecraft appearing over the venue.>

SCP-7513:

 Fuck! FUCK!! HELP ME!!! SOMEONE HELP ME!!!

<Multiple gunshots are heard, one piercing SCP-7513‚Äôs skin on its leg.>

SCP-7513:

 FUCK!!! PLEASE!!! SOMEONE!!! HELP! FUCKING HELP ME!!! PLEASE!!!

POI-481:

 Oh, darlin‚Äô‚Ä¶ we ain‚Äôt gon‚Äô kill ya! You‚Äôll be lovin‚Äô yer new life as a King, I tell ya!

<SCP-7513‚Äôs pleas turn into ineligible screams. The footage turns upwards, revealing the spaceship. The portal inside opens, showing a massive interior similar to that of a beehive. Various massive hornets similar to POI-481 are seen faintly inside the ship.>

SCP-7513:

 NO!!! NO!!!! NONONONONONONONONONONONONONO!!!

<Footage blurs as SCP-7513 falls to the ground, letting go of its cell phone for a brief moment before grabbing it again. Field reports show that SCP-7513 utilized the fake flower on its shirt‚Äôs ability to spray water to blind POI-481, before using its sharp edge to pry itself free from POI-481.>

<SCP-7513 is caught by a civilian and quickly flees the scene. The footage ends abruptly>

[END LOG]

POI-481 entered the ship and disappeared with the rest of its species. Its whereabouts are currently unknown. No casualties were reported. Witnesses were amnesticized and the cover story of structural failure was given to the media.
