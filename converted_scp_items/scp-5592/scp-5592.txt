Special Containment Procedures:

 The residency that receives SCP-5592's transmissions has been purchased by a Foundation front company and Provisional Site-322 has been established within the home. Due to SCP-5592's size and distance from Earth, it poses no threat to human life and/or The Veil.

SCP-5592-1

Description:

 SCP-5592 is a seventy-millimeter film projector that is orbiting the dwarf planet Pluto; No alteration in the orbit has been noted. SCP-5592 will broadcast encrypted messages, videos, and images to a home in the residential neighborhood of Bella Vista, Philadelphia, PA on the following dates:

February 14th

April 29th

August 4th

SCP-5592-1 is a 1959 model 'Philco' Black and White television capable of decrypting and displaying the transmissions on its interface.

Items recovered within Provisional Site-322 include the following:

A single golden wedding band; a stamp reading 'G+M 1948' was found along the interior of the band.

An empty cigar box; a monogram reading GMJ is printed on the outer leather cover.

A framed photograph of a man at around 20 years of age in an American Air Force WWII uniform.

A search into the prior owners of the property has not uncovered anything conclusive.
