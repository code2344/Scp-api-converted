Yes. Director Cowell asked me to look at the conprocs for SCP-5386. There was nothing on the page but a strange image. I think it's a memetic agent but I can't be sure.

I can tell it functions as a joint memetic. It removes recent memories and puts the person looking at it to sleep for a wlile. Mostly harmless, but very invasive. Intrusiveness on par with some kill agents I’ve seen. What inoculations do you have?

The plot thickens. SCP-5386 can’t be accessed without a password from the Site Director. Isn’t that interesting

Halley, there have been complaints from staff as Site-22 concerning mistreatment of Humanoids and D-class. The Site Director has been told to expect you and the files are on your desk.

Use the normal plan of attack: stay low to the ground and be helpful. Site-22 has a no telecommunications policy so you can only contact me when you're at the hotel. I expect weekly reports, and keep an eye on the Senior Staff.

The plane's at 7 PM on the dot, Tuesday, usual airport.
