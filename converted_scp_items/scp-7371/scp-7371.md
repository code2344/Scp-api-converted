##### **Special Containment Procedures:**
_We should all bow._
SCP-7371 is to be kept in a large humanoid containment chamber. Every 20 days[1](javascript:;), prior to a Malob-event, the entity is to be provided with 5 kilograms of gold. At 11:25 AM on the first day of a uinal, all CCTV devices situated within the containment chamber of SCP-7371 are to be deactivated and remain so for a duration of 15 minutes. All existing footage of SCP-7371 engaging in a Malob-event is to be disposed of immediately without viewing of its contents. Personnel exhibiting any symptoms of illness or manifesting signs of religious fanaticism _pure love_ are to be removed from SCP-7371's area of influence and receive immediate medical attention.
Should a Taak-event take place, foundation personnel in a 500-meter radius are to be evacuated into the nearest shelter. Security operatives, equipped with level-A CROYANCE[2](javascript:;) suits, are to patrol the facility during the event and neutralize any SCP-7371-1 instance on sight.
##### **Description:**
SCP-7371 is a sapient humanoid entity measuring 2.7 meters and weighing 286 kilograms. _It's beautiful._ The entity has dark-grey skin, with white ornamental markings resembling flames, located on the cranial and abdominal regions. The origin of these paintings remain unidentified. SCP-7371 displays four bat-like wings and two sets of horns. With the exception of its eyes, SCP-7371 possesses no facial features, resulting in its inability to speak.
Within a precise time frame and upon receiving materials of a specific quantity, SCP-7371 executes an unknown activity, identified as a Malob-event. The condition of SCP-7371, along with its influence on its environment when a Malob-event is not conducted at the proper time, is identified as a Taak-event.
The designation SCP-7371-1 is assigned to multiple diminutive entities similar in appearance to Alouatta pigra[3](javascript:;). _They're family._ Their skin is composed of alabaster[4](javascript:;), however, this characteristic does not impede their movements. These entities display two enlarged, lizard-like eyes and share the same lack of facial features as observed in SCP-7371. Instances of SCP-7371-1 possess a level of intelligence on par with regular howler monkeys.
SCP-7371-1 instances possess a viable and functional body, however, they exhibit indifference toward their own physical well-being. Notably, most of the SCP-7371-1 instances display no initiative to sustain themselves, and consequently succumb to starvation, a process that may extend up to three days following their manifestation. _His most faithful ascetics._
##### **Malob-Event:**
After certain materials have been provided to SCP-7371 during the first day of a uinal, a Malob-event happens.
The entire event releases a potent flow of Akiva radiations[5](javascript:;) with a peak situated mid-Malob-event.
Any living entity witnessing the event, either directly or remotely via CCTV footage, will experience internal combustion of the skull, with temperatures recorded at approximately 3.67*104 Kelvin. In some of these occurrences, afflicted individuals have exhibited lava emanation from their cranial region. _It makes for a beautiful firework._ It remains unclear whether this phenomenon is an intended consequence of SCP-7371 or the result of elevated levels of anomalous radiation. This phenomenon is voluntarily induced by SCP-7371.
Should the Malob-event conclude without any disturbances, all living and sentient beings within a 500-meter radius will be subject to the ensuing effects:
  * significant release of endorphins within the brain
  * devout reverence towards SCP-7371
  * _He is the air I breathe He is the light I see._
  * a slight euphoria

The psychological impacts of a Malob-event will diminish over a period ranging from one to three month, contingent upon the prior beliefs of the affected subject.
Following a Malob-event, the containment chamber of SCP-7371 is devoid of any trace of the materials involved, with the rare exception of small accumulations of volcanic ash.
##### **Taak-Event:**
When the time for a Malob-event has come and no materials have been provided to SCP-7371, a Taak-event happens.
During this event, individuals within a 500-meter radius are prone to contract an infectious disease in a severe form and SCP-7371-1 instances manifest seemingly at random inside the area of influence, regardless of the state of consciousness of SCP-7371.
Throughout numerous of these events, SCP-7371 has been observed engaging in various activities within its containment chamber. These actions include pacing back and forth, clawing at the walls, placing an SCP-7371-1 instance on its lap and stroking it, or angrily glaring at the surveillance cameras. _He waved at me once._
The SCP-7371-1 instances will forage the location of their appearance, subsequently delivering their collected items to SCP-7371 in what seems to be an attempt to initiate a new Malob-event. _A holy work._ The materials can include :
  * Personal items such as rings, pendants, bracelets, earrings, watches
  * Electrical components such as circuit boards, wires, batteries
  * Small animals such as rats, insects, cats
  * Any kind of food
  * Human body parts such as fingers, eyes, tongues, noses, teeth or ears
  * Other SCP-7371-1 instances when there is nothing else to give

Upon presentation of an offering by an SCP-7371-1 instance within the containment chamber, SCP-7371 inflicts a wound on its arm using its claws and then applies a drop of its blood onto the forehead of said instance. The wound heals immediately after that.
Once a substantial quantity of materials has been accumulated, the SCP-7371-1 instances depart from the vicinity of SCP-7371 and proceed to wander the area without discernible purpose.
  

[Addendum 7371.A](javascript:;)
[Close Addendum 7371.A](javascript:;)
**Dr. Rend** was tasked with identifying a dependable alternative to the gold utilized during Malob-events, due to its current exceedingly high cost and the risk of impact on the judgment of all personnel within the facility.
Experiments were conducted at Remote Testing Ground-17-B situated 5 kilometers away from the main Site, throughout 3 different Malob-events.
A D-class, different for every iteration of the experiment, was placed in a room neighboring the test chamber of SCP-7371 so they could not witness the Malob-events. They were given the task to describe how they were feeling at the end of each test and were then surgically and mentally examined.
The materials used in the course of the different experiments were selected after observation of the items gathered by SCP-7371-1 instances during Taak-events.
  * [_Experiment #1_](javascript:;)
  * [_Experiment #2_](javascript:;)
  * [_Experiment #3_](javascript:;)

An assortment of beef meat is provided to SCP-7371. The entity displays evident discontent, yet continues with the Malob-event.
_The Malob-event is completed in 11.4 minutes._
In the other room, D-4539 collapses on the ground. Surgical examination revealed that D-4539 had developed a functional third arm and heterochromia. No additional information was obtained from D-4539.
5 kilograms of silver are offered to SCP-7371. The entity stares at the camera with visible anger before proceeding with the Malob-event.
_The Malob-event is completed in 16.4 minutes._
D-8524 instantly falls to the ground, visibly unconscious. Surgical examination revealed that most of the organs of the subject were turned to marble. D-8524 did not survive.
SCP-7371 is given a live goat. The entity appears disgusted at the animal but still carries on the Malob-event.
_The Malob-event is completed in 8.42 minutes._
SCP-7371 seems irritated and carves ██████ ███████ on the walls using its claws. _Duty calls._  
Subject D-3952 seemingly enters a state of euphoria. Psychological examination revealed symptoms similar to the usage of gold in Malob-event, but notably stronger. D-3952 was terminated after attempting to free SCP-7371 from containment. See Incident Report 7371.01 for further documentation.
  

[Incident Report 7371.01](javascript:;)
[Close Incident Report 7371.01](javascript:;)
_I can't let them see this._
The Foundation became aware of this transcript only after Incident 7371.02, during an investigation of Dr. Rend's computer and belongings.
**BEGIN AUDIO TRANSCRIPT**
-**Dr. Königswald** : This is Dr. Jeffrey Königswald, reporting pathologist for Site-17's coroner department, recording my preliminary remarks on D-3952, terminated after Mara's little tests on SCP-7371. I pray to God one day this lass learns empathy.
_A clicking sound, quickly followed by the song "Y'a d'la joie", by Charles Trenet. The pathologist is humming the lyrics as he is carrying on the procedure. Dr. Königswald seems to be cutting the clothes of the deceased man using a pair of scissors._
-**Dr. Königswald** : I apologize for the indignity, my friend.
_Grating sounds of a metal recipient being placed by Dr. Königswald under the operation table, presumably the bucket used for containing excised organs of the cadaver. Incision and sawing sounds followed by movement._
-**Dr. Königswald** : Mmh?
_Another clicking sound, the music stops. Coughing and groaning sounds._
-**Dr. Königswald** : WHAT TH-
_A loud sound of metal hitting something, followed by someone falling to the ground. The voice of a woman matching Dr. Rend's._
-**Dr. Rend** : Sorry Jeff.
_More coughing sounds. A low, gravely voice speaks, matching D-3952's._
-**D-3952** : So you have seen my invitation, (_difficult breaths_) come, we have matters to discuss.
-**Dr. Rend** : Yes Lord, but are you certain this is safe?
-**D-3952** : Your safety is not my concern.
-**Dr. Rend** : Of course, I apologize.
-**D-3952** : Let us get straight to the point, I will not stand being within this lowly envelope any longer than need be. (_grunts, coughs_) You will find me a worthy offering, specifically one of your own kind. Do it without attracting attention.
-**Dr. Rend** : Anything my Lord wishes, but can I ask why?
-**D-3952** : No, you may not. (_groans_)
-**Dr. Rend** : I understand. The Committee won't approve the use of D-class personnel just like that though. I'll need to-
-**D-3952** : (_interrupting her_) Do what you must. But should you fail, your brain matter will decorate the walls of your office.
-**Dr. Rend** : I live to serve, I won't fail you.
-**D-3952** : It better be the case. Now leave, the corpse-handler will soon return to his senses.
_The sound of heeled shoes gradually diminishes as the source distances itself, followed by low coughs and then complete silence._
  

##### **Discovery:**
SCP-7371 was identified following a daily report by undercover Foundation Agent ██████, stationed in Cancún, Mexico, wherein he professed his love and veneration for "The Fallen Lord". All communication with Agent ██████ has been severed, and he is presumed to have been killed in action. _He was too weak to serve._
Within the same week, the area witnessed a succession of robberies, violent homicides, extensive infrastructure damage, widespread riots, public executions, instances of arson as well as outbreaks of infectious diseases, including bubonic plague and leprosy, in addition to an isolated case of SCP-████.
MTF Beta-7 (“Maz Hatters”) was deployed to secure SCP-7371 within the tumultuous city. The anomaly had amassed a significant contingent of devotees, along with numerous hundreds of SCP-7371-1 instances. The mission concluded with great difficulty, MTF Beta-7 suffering major casualties and one instance of betrayal from within. _A new member in our family?_
A misinformation campaign of unprecedented scale is still to this day being conducted to cover up the events.
  

[Addendum 7371.B](javascript:;)
[Close Addendum 7371.B](javascript:;)
The subsequent transcript originates from a notebook originally belonging to Level 2 researcher R.████, and was discovered beneath a dislodged tile within the containment chamber of SCP-7371. CCTV footage revealed the entity concealing it. It appears that the entity took advantage of the 15-minute window during which CCTV surveillance is deactivated to engage in writing activities, when it had spare time following a Malob-event.  
SCP-7371 exhibited aggression towards the Class D personnel sent to recover the item, but was swiftly sedated by the accompanying security operatives.
The texts were inscribed using a notably antiquated variant of Popti'[6](javascript:;), intertwined with an unidentified language. The following translation was accomplished over the course of several months, utilizing both pattern recognition AI technologies and the expertise of paralinguistic specialists from Site-12. The resultant prose exhibited an unexpectedly high level of sophistication despite being a roughly translated text. Research on the potential anomalous properties of the inscriptions is ongoing. Certain words remain untranslatable.
  

_My thrall[7](javascript:;) has pilfered this curious parchment, upon which I inscribe my reflections._
_It shall serve me well._
* * *
_A span of 148 Obloths[8](javascript:;) has elapsed since my arrival to this continent. It appears my estimation of mankind was unduly modest, as they have succeeded in capturing me._
_Such humiliation shall not be permitted to persist, soon this masquerade will reach its conclusion, since for one of my Order, the absence of stratagems is but a transient phenomenon._
* * *
_The passage of time since last I was in the company of my kindred weighs heavily upon me._
_From the moment I acknowledged my confinement within this land until now, I have not encountered such a profound sense of despondency. The experience of such emotions is deeply distasteful to me._
_My thoughts drift to the other clans, what fate has befallen them? For the second instance in my vast lifespan, apprehension takes hold._
_The horror of the Siege pales in significance to the dread of wandering on this Duraat[9](javascript:;)-smelling soil._
_I find myself unable to recall my Lady's visage._
_What is this searing pain that grips me?_
* * *
_It has come to my attention that these detestable men engage in the study of my person, but how could they possibly fathom the depths of my being?_
_Their pursuits are not rooted in a quest for enlightenment, rather, they are driven by a profound fright. Their primary objective is to obstruct my progress, I am sure of it. This, I cannot sanction._
_I shall call upon Uzuraël. She possesses the wisdom for our path forward, as she invariably has proven so. Undoubtedly, she will effortlessly breach the defenses of this perplexing concrete temple._
_Will she recognize me? Will she_
_forgive?_
* * *
_With the passing of countless moments in sheer disarray, my memory has dimmed, yet it is imperative that I recollect the reviving ritual._
_If my mind serves me accurately, the priests clad in loincloths, chanted in an alien tongue and sacrificed their own to return their lost King._
_The magnitude of extravagance necessary to orchestrate such a ritual undoubtedly necessitates a mind of considerable intricacy. Yet, it ought not to astonish me, for among humanity's ranks are a not insignificant number of individuals whose sanity is debatable. In this particular aspect, they share a commonality with my kind._
_My kind. The carnage._
_The exile._
_What have I done?_
* * *
_In the absence of the crystal-crowned scholars from my private chambers, I yet perceive the unsettling scrutiny of their diminished vision, channeled through the curious devices affixed to the ceiling._
_Let it be known, I shall not be fooled by their duplicity, my intentions shall remain enshrouded from their gaze until such time as I have successfully secured man flesh. To accomplish this venture, it may become necessary to momentarily divert their attention, albeit such maneuvers are beneath the stature of my title and cowardly concealment grates against the very founding of my illukthe[10](javascript:;). However, the critical nature of my operation necessitates discretion._
* * *
_I have successfully recalled a clever trick frequently employed by my offsprings, which I shall now utilize._
_Should the gaze of my jailers fall upon me whilst engaged in the sacred rites, their minds shall encounter an eruption of such magnitude, it would render the formidable Spider-Legged Witch herself submissive in her blazing fury._
_My offsprings. Blood on my hands. It hurts._
* * *
_I have been approached by one of the white-coated practitioners who so keenly observe my endeavors. There exists within her a thirst for blood and a devotion surpassing mere superficial observation. An undreamt ally, perhaps a covert antagonist, or merely a zealot. She bears a striking resemblance to the Manic Nahilban, in her unchecked taste for viscera._
_My disdain for adherents of such sanguinary and vicious circles is profound, yet there lies a potential utility in this encounter. Might I orchestrate a transformation wherein, instead of proffering their lackluster materials, they extend the essence of their own ilk? Given her mangled morales, there exists a possibility to sway her towards such a proposition, despite the distaste it invokes._
* * *
_I have always firmly believed that the essence of humanity was encapsulated within their inexplicable penchant for perpetuating their own demise, however, I should rejoice, for I am to become an integral component of this very process._
_Indeed, the fear-driven simpletons will soon offer their own flesh and blood as a substitute for their tarnished matters. I find myself almost sympathizing with these unfortunate souls. Yet, they should find solace, as their sacrifice shall contribute to a Nobler cause, my return to the**island**[11](javascript:;)._
_The nightmare is over, at last._
_I'm done for._

# **Incident Report 7371.02**
**CCTV Footage Transcript**
**Summary:** Dr. Rend has entered the containment chamber of SCP-7371.
* * *
_Static view of SCP-7371 in its containment chamber_
**11:11:05** | The entity slices the tendons of Dr. Rend and assumes a cross-legged position. SCP-7371 appears to be praying. Dr. Rend is immobilized on the ground and regardless of the evident crippling pain, she is praying as well.
_Akiva radiation are emitted at an exponentially increasing rate._
**11:11:12** | An SCP-7371-1 instance emerges from the ventilation system and joins SCP-7371 in its act of prayer.
_As the intensity of the radiation escalates, a faint voice speaking an unidentified language becomes audible._
**11:11:47** | Several SCP-7371-1 instances continuously manifest around SCP-7371, they all assume a deeply bowed position.
_The amount of Akiva radiation reaches a concentration fatal to humans. Personnel present on-site are thus instructed to evacuate. MTF Eta-77 (“Spheres Within Spheres”) assisted by MTF Epsilon-11 (“Nine-Tailed Fox”) are dispatched in the event that a dangerous pistiphage[12](javascript:;) entity is released by SCP-7371._
**11:15:03** | The room darkens significantly and the air boils as a result of the anomalous radiation.
_The MTF units are unable to approach the containment chamber of SCP-7371 due to the extreme amount of radiations._
**11:20:12** | The population of SCP-7371-1 instances in the containment chamber reaches 30 individuals and static electricity in the room is building-up massively, to a point where it is visible.
_The concentration of Akiva radiation reaches an amount sufficient to alter nearby reality and a hurricane forms above Site-17._
**11:23:00** | A tear opens in the abdomen of Dr. Rend entirely flaying her. A blurry humanoid figure can be seen through.
_A remotely controlled combat drone is sent to disrupt the ritual. The Apparition is evaluated to be a type 6 Behemoth on the Redwick-Nacht scale, with the potential to cause an HK-Class 'Deific Subjugation' scenario. The Alpha Nuclear Warheads are left on standby, to be activated should the ritual continue without interruption._
**11:24:36** | The drone reaches the cell while the tear expands, traversing the confines of the chamber by eating through the walls and ceiling.
**11:24:39** | The doors to the cell are opened remotely. At the same time, the Apparition attempts to navigate through the tear, causing a 4.6 earthquake in the area.
**11:25:41** | The drone enters the chamber while the Apparition, with one arm already manifested in this reality, is in the process of transitioning its remaining three arms. Six SCP-7371-1 instances rush towards the drone.
**11:25:57** | The drone is slowly disassembled by the SCP-7371-1 instances.
_Before being dismantled in its entirety, self-destruction protocol is triggered remotely. A countdown starts._
**11:26:07** | The Apparition has its abdomen in this reality, leaking an impossible amount of Akiva radiation and making the ground melt. SCP-7371 and the SCP-7371-1 instances all pray before the Apparition.
_The countdown reaches an end, making the drone explode._
**11:26:13** | The manifestation of the Apparition is halted by the detonation, resulting in parts of its materialized form being severed as the tear closes. The Apparition seems to be deceased. SCP-7371, seemingly overwhelmed by anger, proceeds to exterminate every instance of SCP-7371-1.
**11:26:58** | SCP-7371 breaches containment by forcefully rupturing the compromised doors.
_SCP-7371 is intercepted and sedated by MTF Epsilon-11 54 minutes succeeding the end of the ritual, having caused major damage to the site and killed or injured several MTF units. The entity is sedated and placed in temporary heavy containment._
* * *
**Aftermath:** SCP-7371 currently abstains from any form of interaction and has ceased all initiation of Malob-events. The entity now exhibits a persistent state of apathy and remains motionless since the incident.
