**V:** _Chi è?_  
  
**G:** It's Giordani.  
  
**V:** Ah, Carlo. Habit of calling me during work hours, eh?  
  
**G:** (_laughter_) Promise it's important.  
  
**V:** _Sure_. By the way, I saw your handiwork this morning; it's nothing less than frontpage.  
  
**G:** Of course. It's what he deserved.  
  
**V:** Hm?  
  
**G:** I had to petition Dario to let me on it… he was going to give it to that bastard Secuzzo.  
  
**V:** You never liked him.  
  
**G:** Of course! He writes like a pig and his article—how do I put it? His article would be making sweet, sweet love to the last page of the Corriere! How disgraceful.  
  
**V:** Okay, okay, I understand. But why bother _me_ with this?  
  
**G:** Ah… you see…  
  
**V:** Carlo. What is it.  
  
**G:** Can you fax me the files for the last several murders?  
  
**V:** The cat out of the bag. You know I cannot.  
  
**G:** Enzo, how long have you known me? or Ruggero?  
  
**V:** It is not about you. I cannot just fax files to every journalist that asks for it.  
  
**G:** Enzo…  
  
**V:** No. The captain will have my badge. Not to mention these government officials that have been about—the ones doing the investigation.  
  
**G:** They carabinieri?  
  
**V:** Not the carabinieri type, they are dressed different.  
  
**G:** Then to hell with them! I came to you because I think I have a lead.  
  
**V:** What have you got that the investigators do not?  
  
**G:** I've been working on it in my spare time but anything from me is conjecture. You know, I managed to talk to Nastasha—  
  
**V:** You did? She did not speak a word to us…  
  
**G:** Because you don't know her as well. Plus you're a cop.  
  
**V:** You are not much better.  
  
**G:** Just give me a shot Enzo. If it pans, it pans; if not I'll be the first to let you know—before anything happens.  
  
**V:** Not one word of this?  
  
**G:** As always.  
  
**V:** Send it over in English. Good luck.

Carlo here. Recording so that boss of mine doesn't think I'm taking a useless tour around town. Talked to Nastasha—gave her Enzo's number in case—and confirmed what the rest have been doing. So far all of them have seen that movie, that recent horror one, then get immediately caught up on some wild goose chase… which they never return from. The police have this information. Enzo's fax said as much. Even if they couldn't confirm it with the most recent victim, why haven't they investigated? Two is a coincidence—three is a pattern. I could be onto something big.

**INT. - DI SANZA'S HOUSE - NIGHT**
The living room is devoid of life. A sickly yellow permeates the room from the chandelier, which we pan to: Di Sanza is hung up on it, bloodied, dead. ████████ drags Mrs. Crenshaw in from the foyer area, an ice pick in IT's other hand.
She struggles to hit ████████, but she receives a stab to the stomach for her troubles. ᵢₜ strings her up on the chandelier, adjacent to Di Sanza.
Crenshaw is crying. ᵢₜ laughs.

Carlo here. I attended the film, same day and time as the others… it wasn't that bad of a film. Mostly unfortunate targets plucked out from the crowds to get killed. The names in the movie seemed familiar, but I—er—couldn't place them exactly. It's not like I've ever heard of its director, Aldila, but I haven't been in Italy for too long after all. More importantly; there was a photograph taped under the seat. I don't know what made me check that or how ᴵᵀ could've gotten there—one of the most popular movies of 1984 and always in theaters? The theater's cleaned every showing.
It's not practical or smart of me to trace random photos but it's a start. Nastasha mentioned something about photographs as well.
Is this what Ruggero did? How did he end up so… _twisted_? Mangled?
The next stop to the answer is Castle Sforzesco, then.

I _forbid_ it. Absolutely not.  
  
Enzo, please, I ca—  
  
You very much can! In fact I am _ordering_ you to, Carlo. You are in over your head.  
  
I told you I would let you know when things happened.  
  
So a man being gutted open like a fish next to your social call is a "thing"?  
  
I called the police as soon as I could… what more could I have done for him? Stitch him up right there?  
  
Drop the story.  
  
You know I can't.  
  
What is stopping you? Your life is at stake, you could have been killed no less than five times in the last seven hours, and yet you still persevere with this? It's been a week!  
  
I've started, Enzo, you've seen my work. Once I'm on something I see ᵢₜ to the end. I can't let some murderer roam the streets, not when I have a lead.  
  
Leave the new polaroid alone. Your "lead" is only there because he is _letting_ you follow him! You are his next victim. He has called every single number available to you. Over. Let the police handle it. Go home and get some rest.  
  
Look. I'll write up what I have so far and I'll see what I can put on it. I'll send it your way once I'm done, then we can talk about it, okay?  
  
  
Your obsession with documenting the ᵗʳᵘᵗʰ will end you sooner than you think.

SCP-6279-1 is an entity appearing in both 6279 and as a construct in physical reality.

**INT. - GIORDANI'S FLAT - NIGHT**
The kitchen is eclipsed in blues and blacks. A beam of light streaks across the eyes of the journalist, who is looking for a crumpled newspaper. He finds it on the wood table.
Shaking, he brings it up to the light in an attempt to read the headline, not noticing ████████ approaching behind him with an electric drill. We see the headline:
'SERIAL KILLER TERRORIZZA MILANO!'
The journalist frantically scans the bottom left of the newspaper. There is no name.
████████ turns on the drill.

**Special Containment Procedures:** All non-curated copies of 6279 are to be destroyed. Cover Story Y71 ("Lost Media") is to be disseminated to prevent any investigation by the general public. SCP-6279 is not to be fully viewed under any circumstance.
**Description:** SCP-6279 is the Italian film _Una morte per lo sciacallo_ (A Death for the Jackal). Its anomalous properties occur when a subject views 6279 in full. The subject — designated 6279-A — will then be targeted by 6279-1. ᴵᵀ will lure -A using either relations to previous victims or the compulsion to understand the actions or identity of 6279-1 before terminating the -A instance.
SCP-6279-1 is an entity appearing in both 6279 and as a construct in physical reality. It is unconfirmed whether this was due to anomalous psychosomatic behavior affected by the public's viewing of 6279, or if 6279 was a rudimentary attempt by 'Ramiro Aldila' (pending PoI status) to contain SCP-6279-1.
6279-1 is also referred to as both "████████" and "ᵢₜ" by 'HARBINGER' in 6279.
It is unknown what "ᵢₜ" is referring to, but ᵢₜ is theorized to be the cause of 6279-1's actions as well as a possible 'hive-mind' of collected consciousnesses of -A victims.
