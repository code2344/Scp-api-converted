SCP-6171 in containment.
**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-6171 is to be stored in a 2m x 2m x 1m terrarium constructed from lead glass. The terrarium is to be secured in a standard small-object multipurpose room. Any personnel entering the containment chamber of SCP-6171 is to be fitted with a Class-B biological and environmental protection suit. The containment chamber of SCP-6171 is to be fitted with a high-sensitivity Geiger counter in case of a communication attempt from SCP-6171.
**Description:** SCP-6171 is a male cockroach of the Gromphadorhina portentosa (Madagascar hissing cockroach) species. SCP-6171's size is consistent with other regular members of the species. SCP-6171 does not have any significant physical characteristics that may differentiate it from other members of the species. SCP-6171 has a baseline output of 1 Gray of radiation, which it constantly outputs regardless of any external environmental factors. SCP-6171's other anomalous ability manifests when it communicates. SCP-6171 communicates through morse code in bursts of gamma radiation, which to date, has not exceeded 3 Gy. In addition to this ability, SCP-6171 shows a significantly higher level of intelligence than that which might be expected from a member of the species. SCP-6171 has been observed on several occasions, performing highly complex cognitive and motor actions, including the use of their front legs to manipulate objects and observing patterns in the routine of personnel[1](javascript:;). Due to the details that SCP-6171 has provided, it is assumed that SCP-6171 previously was a non-anomalous human.

> **Name:** Margaret Copperfinch.
> **Affiliated SCP/GOI:** SCP-6171.
> **Status:** Alive.
> **Details:** Margaret Copperfinch currently resides at 17 Blatta Cresent, Rosewood, Australia. Margaret is believed to be the spouse of SCP-6171, prior to his transformation. Margaret is the mother of three children. The disappearance of SCP-6171 has caused significant emotional and financial hardship for Margaret and her children. Local agents embedded in local law enforcement have given the cover story that Gregory Copperfinch died as a result of a car accident.

Communication attempt #01 |   
---|---  
Aim: | To establish communication with SCP-6171.  
Method: | A speaker was placed into the containment chamber of SCP-6171. Several words were transmitted through the sound system. Test words included: "Hello", "friend", "family", "hope", "life", "Greg", "Gregory", and "struggle".  
Results: | All transmitted words were unsuccessful in establishing communication with SCP-6171.

Communication attempt #02 |   
---|---  
Aim: | To establish communication with SCP-6171.  
Method: | Three variants of vibration motors, attached to control software, were placed into the containment chamber of SCP-6171. Each of the three motors were tested with a control morse code message of "Hello".  
Results: | Motor one (20MhZ) had no effect on SCP-6171. Motor two (35MhZ) also failed to produce a reaction from SCP-6171. Motor three (40MhZ) failed to produce any results. It is theorized that SCP-6171's baseline radioactivity interferes with the vibrations caused by the motors, registering any further communications pointless.
