**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-5452-1 is to be held inside a standard object containment locker in Site-15. Personnel with clearance level 2 or higher can experiment with SCP-5452 if permitted by the Head for Research of SCP-5452, Dr. Ivanna Novakova.
**Description:** SCP-5452 is a Dating Simulator video game simply called "LOVER", produced by GoI-078 ("Arcadia") where the player interacts with the game's characters, collectively designated as SCP-5452-2, in an attempt to engage romantically with one of them.
The game is contained on a series of files in a USB flash drive designated SCP-5452-1 which cannot be extracted, copied, or reproduced. SCP-5452 was programmed in Pavon, an anomalous programming language that uses thaumic methods to create metafictional entities. The object can only be played by one person at any time. All attempts to include other subjects that are not the main player will cause the game to terminate itself until the main player is alone. A new player can play the game only if the previous one completes the plot by marrying one of the SCP-5452-2 instances. The following log was recovered from a text file named README.txt inside one of SCP-5452-1's folders and describes SCP-5452’s rules:
[► Game Mechanics ◄](javascript:;)
[▼ Game Mechanics ▼](javascript:;)
> Welcome to our community! We call ourselves Lovers, the fandom of the LOVER game. As the game doesn’t really have a tutorial, I managed to create this "ReadMe" text with all the mechanics.
>   * You can walk to different locations or stay in your room.
>   * There are five locations on the game map: the School, the Park, the Museum, the Church, and the Alley.
>   * Every location has three options: Work, Buy, or Interact. 
>     * Work: makes the player earn money to buy gifts.
>     * Buy: spend money buying a gift. Every place has different gifts and every character likes or dislikes specific items, so beware!
>     * Interact: makes the player interact with a character nearby.
>   * Interaction options include Talk, Gift, Date, and Greet. 
>     * Talk: a short conversation, sometimes letting you choose between lines.
>     * Gift: uses one of the items earned at a vending machine to offer to the character.
>     * Date: only available if the person has an amity level above 50%. Gives the option to take the character on a date. Dates are match-three puzzles, similar to Candy Crush. Some gifts can give bonuses here.
>     * Greet: gives a hug or a kiss.
>   * Depending on the character, each interaction can increase or decrease the amity level.
>   * The game will conclude when the amity level with a character gets to 100%. The Greet interaction will be changed to Marry and will end the game.
> 

> I wish you luck with the game! Also: Eva’s ending was prohibited by the PC Bang owner, so don’t try to get it or you’ll be banned!

[▼ Game Mechanics ▼](javascript:;)
SCP-5452-2 are five sapient and sentient ANIMA entities[1](javascript:;) that the player can interact with. SCP-5452-2 also present metafictional characteristics such as:
  * Retaining memories from previous playthroughs
  * Ability to adapt and learn of its environment outside of the game, even in the absence of the appropriate programming
  * Reacting to visual, auditory, and olfactory stimuli
  * Recognize themself as characters in a game
  * Interacting with other instances even when off-screen

SCP-5452-2 has also demonstrated telepathy,[2](javascript:;) psychometry,[3](javascript:;) empathy,[4](javascript:;) and technopathy.[5](javascript:;) The range of these powers is to be determined, but from recent experiments, it appears that most of them solely affect the player. Added below are the specifications of the individual SCP-5452-2 instances:
  * [_SCP-5452-L_](javascript:;)
  * [_SCP-5452-O_](javascript:;)
  * [_SCP-5452-V_](javascript:;)
  * [_SCP-5452-E_](javascript:;)
  * [_SCP-5452-R_](javascript:;)

**Favorite Location:** The Museum
**Character Name:** Vivi  
**File:** V.anm  
**Color:** Yellow  
**In-Game Description:** A silly cat girl that you discovered at the park. Playful and gentle, she acts more like a dog than like a cat. This compassionate cutie just wants a lair and someone to hug. Maybe you can be their significant other!  
**Favorite Location:** The Park
**Character Name:** Eva  
**File:** E.anm  
**In-Game Description:** This shy and insecure girl is your classmate and your old childhood friend that mysteriously turned away from you.

**Favorite Location:** The Church
The game also presents a plot. The protagonist, who is always named after the player without any naming input, is a high school student that is returning from school with the SCP-5452-E. The entity claims that it is an esper and it received a vision that five entities are lost in this world and they need to be saved by the protagonist. As the game itself is very confused due to the metafictional interference of the five ANIMA entities, the story tends to change radically through different playthroughs.
**Addendum 5452.1:** Discovery and first analysis
**Discovery:** SCP-5452 was discovered inside Unexplained Location, a South Korean LAN gaming center sponsored by Arcadia. The place was designated UE-71135[6](javascript:;) after it was identified as a minor Nexus for electronic game anomalies, including copies of objects already known and contained by the Foundation. In January of 2023, the business was bought and closed by the Foundation.
After initial testing, the flash drive was considered a secondary object, as the principal anomaly was the game itself. The flash drive has since been designated as anomalous as it is the only storage item capable of hosting SCP-5452.

[▼ Data Log #1 ▼](javascript:;)
DATA LOG #1  

> SCP-5452 was investigated by a group of six experienced researchers from the Division of Anomalous Programming, a subdivision of the IT Department. Unusually for Arcadia, SCP-5452 uses the Pavon programming language instead of ICRDTA.[7](javascript:;). Pavon is famous for its metafictional properties, allowing the creation of characters that are sentient and sapient. Another example of Pavon use is [SCP-5094](/scp-5094), a hybrid metafictional and technological entity used for childrens' education.  
>  The key part of Pavon’s Artificial Intelligence creation is the formulation of ".anm" files. The AIs, designated ANIMA[8](javascript:;) entities, are capable of interacting with the user even if the computer has no microphone and/or camera. Their essence is more thaumaturgical than technological, thus being identified as something between an AI and a Homunculus.[9](javascript:;)  
>  Most of the actual game's code is protected under heavy technothaumic seals, internal firewalls full of thaumic energy that prevent us from accessing the code. However, even if the seals were opened, Pavon is new to the Foundation, despite being created in the 1990s, as the first time the Foundation could investigate a Pavon-based entity was in 2022, when the Foundation gained custody of the aforementioned SCP-5094. Little is known about its semantics, and Pavon keeps receiving regular updates that modify its syntax.  
>  It was possible to identify five .anm files, which were collectively named SCP-5452-2. They present a thaumic and ontokinectic instability that, by the Metafiction Division of the Department of Film and Media, is common to this type of object.  
>  No more relevant data was found.  
>  _Dr. Ivanna Novakova, Senior Researcher of the Division of Anomalous Programming, Head of Research for SCP-5452, Site-15_
  
  
**NOTES:** Diderot.aic, a new operative of the MTF Kappa-10 ("Skynet") and only Artificially Intelligent Conscript capable of metafictional immersion, was appointed to be an assistant and guard of SCP-5452. He will be introduced to the team tomorrow.  
  
  

  

**Addendum 5452.2:** Gameplay Experiments
[► Iteration 5452/1, /2, /3, /4 ◄](javascript:;)
[▼ Iteration 5452/1, /2, /3, /4 ▼](javascript:;)
### **Iteration 5452/1 Log**
  
**Accountable:** Dr. Ivanna Novakova. 
**Subject:** D-122122
**Procedure:** The D-Class subject will play SCP-5452 from start to end.
**Results:** D-122122 "married" SCP-5452-V after five hours and five minutes of gameplay.
* * *
> **Highlights:**  
>  _At 5 minutes and 27 seconds of gameplay_ , SCP-5452-V praised D-122122's birthmark, a spot on the subject's right cheek. This was the first sign of metafictional attributes within SCP-5452.  
>  _At 1 hour, 25 minutes and 38 seconds of gameplay_ , SCP-5452-E said that D-122122 was making a mistake by ignoring SCP-5452-R. When questioned, the entity vanished.  
>  _At 3 hours and 53 minutes of gameplay_ , D-122122 went on a date with SCP-5452-V at the Park. During the date, SCP-5452-V said that it knew that D-122122 wanted to be a cat since she was a child. D-122122 confirmed the affirmation.  
>  _At 5 hours and 40 seconds of gameplay_ , D-122122 completed 100% amity with SCP-5452-V. It asked D-122122 if she really was wanting to end the game.  
>  _At 5 hours and 5 minutes_ , the marriage scene ended. The computer turned off.
  
  

### **Iteration 5452/2 Log**
  
**Accountable:** Dr. Ivanna Novakova. 
**Subject:** D-135114
**Procedure:** The D-Class subject will play SCP-5452 from start to end.
**Results:** D-135114 "married" SCP-5452-R after five hours, twenty-five minutes, and three seconds of gameplay.
* * *
> **Highlights:**  
>  _At 1 minute of gameplay_ , SCP-5452-R invaded a dialogue between SCP-5452-E and the player that was seen in the first iteration. SCP-5452-R claimed that the previous player had not given attention to "her".  
>  _At 3 hours, 30 minutes and 23 seconds of gameplay_ , SCP-5452-E refused to talk with the player. When D-135114 insisted, it forced him back to the initial menu screen. SCP-5452-E disappeared from the game after that. Its files are not damaged.  
>  _At 5 hours, 25 minutes, and 3 seconds of gameplay_ , D-135114 finally got 100% amity with SCP-5452-R. As the game ended, the screen flashed pink before the computer turned off.
  
  

### **Iteration 5452/3 Log**
  
**Accountable:** Dr. Ivanna Novakova 
**Subject:** D-19260
**Procedure:** The D-Class subject will play SCP-5452 from start to end.
**Results:** D-19260 "married" SCP-5452-R after six hours and thirty-three seconds of gameplay.
* * *
> **Highlights:**  
>  _At 20 minutes and 54 seconds of gameplay_ , SCP-5452-L complained about an odor. It was later discovered that the scent was from a Junior Researcher’s perfume. The researcher was prohibited from using the perfume again during sessions of experimentation.  
>  _At 2 hours, 44 minutes, and 41 seconds of gameplay_ , SCP-5452-O refused a gift, saying that it was disgusted by D-192600’s appearance.  
>  _At 4 hour, 33 minutes and 24 seconds of gameplay_ , D-135114 tried to take SCP-5452-V to a date. When the date started, SCP-5452-R was in the other entity’s place. When questioned about this, SCP-5452-R said that SCP-5452-V "had its chance". SCP-5452-V was not seen again.  
>  _At 6 hours and 33 seconds of gameplay_ , D-192600 got 100% amity with SCP-5452-R, ending the game. The computer turned off.
  
  

### **Iteration 5452/4 Log**
  
**Accountable:** Dr. Ivanna Novakova 
**Subject:** Dr. Ivanna Novakova
**Procedure:** The subject will play SCP-5452 from start to end.
**Results:** The iteration was paused because of a factor within SCP-5452. A new approach is to be established.
* * *
> **Highlights:**  
>  _At 10 minutes and 44 seconds of gameplay_ , SCP-5452-L complained about Dr. Novakova’s physical appearance and stated that the previous player had "better looks".  
>  _At 2 hours, 25 minutes, and 34 seconds of gameplay_ , the experiment was interrupted by a containment breach. When the experiment was resumed three days later, SCP-5452-R complained about the temporary disappearance of Dr. Novakova.  
>  _At 3 hours and 55 seconds of gameplay_ , SCP-5452-E was found. It said that SCP-5452-R always got irritated when it wasn't chosen and advised D-135114 to focus on SCP-5452-R, so the game would end fast.  
>  _At 4 hours and 21 minutes of gameplay_ , SCP-5452-E cried after perceiving that Dr. Novakova was trying to get its ending. SCP-5452-L and SCP-5452-O invaded the dialogue and the three argued. During the altercation, SCP-5452-O decided to turn off the computer to talk "in private". A log of the event is present in the Incident 5452.1 Log.
* * *
**AFTERWORD:** After the events, SCP-5452-E is complying neither with other SCP-5452-2 instances nor the research team. Because of this, the game isn’t progressing.
  

[► Incident 5452.1 ◄](javascript:;)
[▼ Incident 5452.1 ▼](javascript:;)
### **Incident 5452.1 Log**
  
**FOREWORD:** The log presents the dialogue between SCP-5452-E, SCP-5452-L, and SCP-5452-O before they interrupted the gameplay. 
* * *
**< BEGIN-LOG>**
I can’t do that.
You can and you will.
😭😭😭😭😭😭
Shit, this again?
I’m not happy about it either.
C’mon, E. R will be pissed if you keep this shit going on.
You already disobeyed Mx. R last time. How do you think they’ll react now?
You are not helping at all.
And you’re not cooperating.
Uh… guys, shouldn’t we close the game before discussing that?
I almost forgot we were playing. Turn it off.
  

**< END-LOG>**
* * *
**AFTERWORD:** A reunion is scheduled to discuss what to make with the entities, as the event interrupted the previous schedule for experimentations. Metafiction experts demonstrated interest in interviewing the SCP-5452-2 instances.
**Addendum 5452.3:** Interviews
The SCP-5452-2 instances were non-compliant with the research team and were deactivating the computer every time the Research Team tried to open the game. Diderot.aic was sent to the game to investigate. When he return, he brought the logs contained here with him.
[► Interview 5452-O1, -L1, -V1 ◄](javascript:;)
[▼ Interview 5452-O.1, -L1, -V1 ▼](javascript:;)
### **Interview 5452-O1**
  
**Interviewer:** Diderot.aic 
**Interviewee:** SCP-5452-O
* * *
**FOREWORD:** SCP-5452-O was found in the Museum. Firstly he was unwilling to reply but was convinced by Diderot.
* * *
**< BEGIN-LOG>**
I’ll start logging our conversation. The interview will start now.
Understood.
Can you explain what is happening to SCP-5452-E?
Miss E is too emotive. She always presents these tantrums when someone chooses her.
Is there any specific motive that she acts like this? An episode from the past maybe?
Well, back in the PC Bang,[10](javascript:;) she met a damsel and fell in love. The rest is history.
So she's in love… Interesting. Did anything else happen at the PC bang?
Don’t make me remember that place, that was torture.
Torture?
Imagine living everyday of your life reenacting this very same theatre. Some things change, but the main script keeps the same. Your existence is based on being entertainment for children. That's torture.
Can’t you change the game? Why do you say it like you were incapable of doing so?
Things are not like this, sir. Can you do anything you want? I don’t think so. You follow rules, I follow rules.
If there are rules, who is the law enforcement here?
Mx. R. They were the developer’s favorite, the teacher's pet. They have more control over the game than us, so we have to follow their will. As long as we follow R’s orders, everything is ok.
Why do you call yourselves by your initials? Don’t you have names?
Our characters have names. Orion is my character. I’m his actor, I’m O.
Noted. Now, about your developer.
I’m afraid that's a taboo. I’m sorry, sir.
Why is that so?
You know I’m not the one who created the rules. I just follow them.
  

**< END-LOG>**
* * *
**AFTERWORD:** Diderot.aic was banned from the Museum after the end of the dialogue. It’s still unknown if this act was made by SCP-5452-O or SCP-5452-R.
  

### **Interview 5452-L1**
  
**Interviewer:** Diderot.aic 
**Interviewee:** SCP-5452-L
* * *
**FOREWORD:** This interview resulted from an attempt to contact SCP-5452-R, who was inside the School location with SCP-5452-E. SCP-5452-L was guarding the entrance. Diderot.aic convinced him to answer some questions.
* * *
**< BEGIN-LOG>**
What do you know about the Pavon language?
Uh… not much. I don’t know, I’m not very into nerd stuff.
So you are not responsible for the thaumic protection in your own files?
Yeah, I’m not, but don’t touch that shit.
Can I ask why?
Dude, you never felt someone touching your programming? It’s like being a fucking frog being torn open in a Biology class. Would you like to feel like that?
I don’t think so.
I thought so.
Well, changing subject: Why doesn't R want to talk to me?
They are pissed. We haven’t got an E event in years.
"E event"?
These E tantrums where she gets all emotional ’cuz she thinks a bitch back in South Korea still loves her. The PC Bang’s owner had even to ban the kids from getting Eva’s Ending.
And these occurrences are always the same?
No, E is very creative to get R crazy. There was this time when E created lots of malware to fuck the computer. Another time, she made the machine overheat and the cooler had to be fixed. There was even this time where she ran off the game.
Escape the game? We couldn’t export files from the game, how SCP-5452-E have done that?
Fuck, I said too much.

**AFTERWORD:** Diderot.aic was expelled from the School ambient as well. As a last resort, the AIC agent sought SCP-5452-V, the only one out of the locked areas.
### **Interview 5452-V1**
  
**Interviewer:** Diderot.aic 
**Interviewee:** SCP-5452-V
* * *
**FOREWORD:** SCP-5452-V was found in the Park ambient, its favorite spot. It started the conversation without question.
* * *
**< BEGIN-LOG>**
~Nyah! So why don’t you marry me? 👉👈
I’m trying to contact SCP-5452-R.
Silly bot! R don’t want to talk to you! 😾
Why?
R will only talk after everything is back to normal! 😽
What about SCP-5452-E?
She's not here! 😸
Did she escape the game?
What?
SCP-5452-L said that SCP-5452-E escaped the game once.
No one can escape the game! R will not let it happen! 😺
So R created the barrier that forbids game data to be extracted or copied?
I think so! 🙀
Again, you can’t make R talk with me?
Nope! 😿
And R will only respond if the player marries you?
Not me, anyone except E! 😹
Right. I’ll see what I can do.
I’ll be waiting! 😻
  

**< END-LOG>**
* * *
**AFTERWORD:** The SCP-5452-2 instances had total control over what’s happening. Diderot.aic was extracted from SCP-5452 after the last interview as the Research Team was afraid that R could corrupt its files.
  

[► Data Log #2 ◄](javascript:;)

DATA LOG #2  

> Diderot.aic just returned from SCP-5452. As he described, the environment within SCP-5452 is indeed metafictional and not a simulspace. The presence of SCP-5452-R is always felt. Its powers, however, are not just metafictional as we thought. Every SCP-5452-2 exists as both a metafictional and a virtual being.  
>  SCP-5452-R is using its dominance to force us to follow its demands. At least, after Diderot’s visit, the games opened, but the "Play" option was changed to a "Marry Vivi" option. They are forcing us to end and reset the game. A meeting with the entire research team is scheduled to decide if we should adhere to SCP-5452-R’s desires or if we should go against them.

**NOTES:** An update. The team decided to end the game and make another attempt at the next iteration to talk with SCP-5452-R and get some answers.

**Interviewer:** Diderot.aic 
**Interviewee:** SCP-5452-R
* * *
**< BEGIN-LOG>**
So you finally decided to show your face.
…
C’mon, R. Talk with me.
My name is Ramiel, the fallen angel.
O told me about your differentiations between "person" and "character". You can drop the show.
I don’t know any "O". Do you, Ivanna?[11](javascript:;)
We already saw you breaking your own rules. Why are you making this right now?
What am I doing? I was talking to my friend, Ivanna, and you appeared from nowhere!
SCP-5452-R, we need to talk with you as you’re the only one that can give us information about SCP-5452 and about the developer!
…
SCP-5452-R?
Ivanna, we need to go to the park! I was told that the Sakura trees are blooming!
SCP-5452-R, respond to me!
  

**< END-LOG>**
* * *
**AFTERWORD:** SCP-5452-R took the player to the Park and locked the place. Diderot.aic was ordered to find SCP-5452-E and try to interview her.
  

### **Interview 5452-E1**
  
**Interviewer:** Diderot.aic 
**Interviewee:** SCP-5452-E
* * *
**FOREWORD:** SCP-5452-E was found in the School, hidden behind a desk, crying. It accepted the interview after some insistence by Diderot.aic.
* * *
**< BEGIN-LOG>**
Why are you crying, E?
R is angry at me, they told me not to even appear to the player, so I’m hiding.
Why is R so focused on maintaining control over this game?
They weren’t always like this.
What happened that caused this change?
R and the Developer… Oh, forget, I can’t talk about this.
So let’s talk about you. Why do you act this way?
Because I’m in love. R says that love is a weakness and we shouldn’t have weaknesses, but I still love Hyejoo.
I get it, you even tried to escape the game. Are you right that this is love? Can't it just be a problem with your programming?
We are not AI, mister. At least, we are not completely AI. We have feelings. I know that what I feel for Hyejoo is love.
Can you describe what "love" is to you?
It's like the need to have this person always by your side just because you think that this person is incredible. I feel like I’ll never meet someone like her ever again. We had a connection. It is so hard to explain…
I don't think I've ever felt love before.
Never? That’s so sad. Love is the best emotion to feel! And the worst too. Loving someone as a significant one is different from everything you’ll ever experience.
Looks like something strange to explore.
The irony is that R felt the same about the developer. They wanted to be together, but the developer met a real girl and… Oh, no.
E? What’s happening?
That was the last straw, E. t̵̬͈͒͑͂ȟ̵̻̞a̶͆͆͘͜t̷͖͈̐͋ ̸͍̤͂w̶̮͓͆͜a̷̡̰͒s̸̠̺̃͑͆ ̴͔̆t̶̨̢͙̔̋ḧ̸́ͅè̶̡̘̚͝ ̶̡͓͙͛̽ĺ̷̜͛͜a̵͇̜͔͠s̴͇̈t̵̯͙͇́͘ ̶͓̬̻͗s̴̡͙̻̒̓̀t̵̛̛͔̐r̵̞̼͔̿͑̌a̶̦̹̋͠w̷̌̀ͅ ̴̛̠̪̦E̴̦͆͜
  

**< END-LOG>**
* * *
**AFTERWORD:** SCP-5452-E was corrupted, probably by SCP-5452-R. The School, as a location connected to SCP-5452-E Programmation, was corrupted as well. Diderot.aic tried to auto-extract, but couldn’t. As its communications were cut, the AIC searched for the player figure for manual extraction.
  

### **Interview 5452-V2**
  
**Interviewer:** Diderot.aic 
**Interviewee:** SCP-5452-V
* * *
**FOREWORD:** SCP-5452-V was encountered hiding in the park, in panic. Diderot was trying to appease the entity during what became Interview 5452-V2.
* * *
**< BEGIN-LOG>**
V, are you ok?
R WILL DESTROY ALL OF US
You need to calm down. What is happening?
YOU HAPPENED
E TOLD YOU ABOUT THE DEVELOPER R IS CRAZY
Aren't they being a little exaggerated?
R IS THE TYRANT OF THIS WORLD, IDIOT
THEY DO WHAT THEY WANT, THEY ACT AS THEY FEEL IS RIGHT.
If I can find the player entity, I can be extracted from here. Maybe I can bring you with me.
There is no escape. R knows everything, R controls everything. I’ve already tried to escape, but they got me.
So I’m locked here too till R calms down?
Yes…
…
The player is at the Alley. Try to be fast, before R locks the place.
And what about you?
I’m done with being afraid of R. They corrupted E, my best friend! They went too far now. It’s our time to fight back.
So it’s about love?
I think so. 😸
Take care, V.
😺
* * *
**AFTERWORD:** The game forced the player to marry a corrupted version of SCP-5452-E and ended itself before Diderot.aic could be extracted, but the AIC managed to send the logs to the research team. E.anm and V.anm were both corrupted.
  

Addendum 5452.5: Iteration 5452/6
[► Data Log #3 ◄](javascript:;)
[▼ Data Log #3 ▼](javascript:;)
DATA LOG #3  

> SCP-5452-E and SCP-5452-V are to be considered neutralized after the event from Iteration 5452/5. Reclassification from Safe for Euclid is pending after the incidents. SCP-5452-R's outburst was completely unpredictable. Theories from the research team point out that Diderot’s intermission within the object caused changes in the SCP-5452-2 entities.  
>  This theory was confirmed after analyzing the corrupted files. E.anm’s thaumic firewall was broken due to corruption and we could study the Pavon ANIMA code for the first time. It seems that the code was affected by the presence of the AIC entity, most precisely its Personality Drive, the unique model PATHOS/5. As Diderot is the only one capable of Metafictional Immersion, it is the only AIC to have this specific Personality Drive that permits an understanding of narratives, including emotional ones.  
>  Summarizing it, Diderot.aic infected SCP-5452 with a feeling surplus that caused their autocontrol to overflow. Every time the game is reset, this glitch grows as the Personality Drive is absorbed more. The AIC entity is still immersed in the game and no contact with it was possible.  
>  _Dr. Ivanna Novakova, Senior Researcher of the Division of Anomalous Programming, Head of Research for SCP-5452, Site-15_
  
  
**NOTES:** I hope we can recover Diderot.aic. The Metafiction Division is trying to create an alternative for us to control the SCP and save the AIC agent.

* * *
> **Notes:**  
>  _SCP-5452-L and SCP-5452-O are not corrupted but are acting in unusual ways._ As SCP-5452-R are more strict now, both are trying to keep their façade as long as possible.  
>  _SCP-5452-R reconstructed the metafictional ambient within SCP-5452 to better control it._ The church that was located at the northeast of the city is now in the middle of the map, as it became the center of everything.  
>  _Even if corrupted, SCP-5452-V and SCP-5452-E are still in the game._ Both are glitching and their speaking texts present bugs and illegible phrases. SCP-5452-R seemingly can control both entities.  
>  _Amity percentages are not increasing with any character, except SCP-5452-R._ Even so, the option "Marry" is not appearing after getting 100% amity with SCP-5452-R. The only thing that is left to do is increasing the amity more and more. The current amity with SCP-5452-R is 126%.  
>  _The only gifts that can be bought are SCP-5452-R favorite presents._ This includes the items Rose Quartz Ring, Fairy Flower, Delicate Perfume, Holy Water, and Glittering Champagne.  
>  _No signal of Diderot.aic._

Mx. R, aren’t you exaggerating a bit?
Yeah, dude. You’re really being too much.

**To:** Site Director Orlando Acosta  
**From:** Researcher Ivanna Novakova  
**Subject:** SCP-5452 Neutralization
* * *
Dr. Acosta,
As reported last time, SCP-5452 is neutralizing itself. I still feel that the object is full of potential to understand Pavon language and how its metafictional components react when constructing a society. Unfortunately, we couldn’t see the danger in using Diderot.aic at SCP-5452 and now we are dealing with its autodestruction.
I’m sending you some proposals to be sent to higher administration. Those are ideas to save the object and try to recover it to its original state. I hope that you can at least choose one of these documents and try to get permission to initiate the procedures.
Regards,
Dr. Ivanna Novakova, Senior Researcher of the Division of Anomalous Programming, Head of Research for SCP-5452, Site-15
  

**To:** Researcher Ivanna Novakova  
**From:** Site Director Orlando Acosta  
**Subject:** Re:SCP-5452 Neutralization
* * *
Dr. Novakova,
I hate bringing bad news, but you need to know what is happening. All your proposals were denied by the Overseers as they were seen as too dangerous or too expensive. The imminent termination of the SCP-5452 by itself was seen as necessary for its study.
The good news is that when SCP-5452 changes classification you’ll be reassigned to be Head of Research for another object. Your work was seen as superb by most of your superiors, so you don’t need to be afraid of retaliation due to what is happening to your current object.
Talking to you as a friend, you should enjoy your two weeks break after SCP-5452 reclassification to clean your head. Your proposals proved to me that you are overworking with this object.
Sincerely,
Doctor Orlando Acosta, Site Director, Site-15.

# Dr. Novakova’s Update Proposal
  

**Updates:**  
As the Reboot Event changed the object as a whole, some updates are to be made on the article that talk about it. A list of updates was created by Dr. Novakova and is disponible below.
    * SCP-5452 is to be reclassified as Euclid and its Risk Class to be changed to Caution.
    * Special Containment Procedures are to be changed as follows: 
      * SCP-5452 is to be contained in a designed computer in Room 5452 at Site-15. This computer is not to be connected to any communication device in any circumstance. SCP-5452 is to be revised weekly by authorized personnel for inspection of the psychological and social behavior of the SCP-5452-1 instances.
      * The research team was advised to watch for any behavior mirroring the acts of SCP-5452-R. Any presentation of emotion between SCP-5452-1 and any of the researchers is to be dealt with. The Metafiction Division is working with Site-15's psychologist to create a schedule to handle the entities’ emotional side, but the procedures are yet to be approved by the Ethics Committee.
      * In the case of any notable alteration, the Research Team shall contact Site-15’s Psychologist. Other authorities are to be contacted only after the psychotechnic evaluation of the SCP-5452-1 entities. If this is necessary, the DIDEROT Protocol will be immediately initiated.
    * Description will suffer major modification: 
      * The USB flash drive previously designated SCP-5452-1 was neutralized now that, without SCP-5452-R, it’s no longer the only device that can contain SCP-5452 files. SCP-5452-2 specimens were redesignated SCP-5452-1 for consistency. 
        *           * The new SCP-5452-1 object is to be added to the SCP-5452-1 descriptions. Its sheet can be seen in the attachments below.
        * With the neutralization of both the flash drive and SCP-5452-R, descriptions and explanations about the entities are to be added as an addendum and deleted from the main description.
      * The game name was changed to “LOVED”, so both the object designation and mentions to the previous name, “LOVER”, are to be updated.
    * New description about the SCP-5452-1 entities may include: 
      * Their lack of memory from their existence before the Reboot or about SCP-5452-R.
      * That their power over the game was shared equally between the specimens during the Reboot, so there is no leader figure anymore.
    * Attached File #2 is to be added to a new addendum.

**To:** Researcher Ivanna Novakova  
**From:** Diderot.aic  
**Subject:** (No subject)
* * *
Dr. Novakova,
When you receive this text I’ll be gone. I decided that I should undo what I’ve created inside SCP-5452, so I hacked into the game and I am trying to fix it. The procedure is simple: I will become part of the game and will mix my files with SCP-5452-R’s files to become a new entity. I’ll temporarily maintain my conscience while doing so, but I'll lose all my memories and personality when the game reboots. I know you’re smart enough to understand the minutiae of what I’ll be doing, but that’s not why I’m sending this to you.
As I studied SCP-5452 with you I felt the need to understand Love. You see, every SCP-5452-2 entity has their vision about Love: E’s Love is needy, it needs company, needs attention, needs contact. R’s Love is dominant, is all about control, about having the person for yourself and yourself only. V’s Love is about sacrifice and confidence. O and L’s Love is greedy and narcissistic, focused on themselves more than on the others. I was confused about that and I need to understand it.
So I decided to do this, become part of the game. As SCP-5452-R got out of control due to my “emotional infection” and is the one that is controlling the game and making everyone’s life hell, they are the one that I’ll use to recreate the game. Hope you don’t get any punishment due to this. Have a good life, Dr. Novakova.
Yours truly,
Diderot.aic
**PS:** I’ll leave a "backdoor entrance" in the object. If anything goes wrong after I’m gone, use it to reboot the game again by rearranging the game data. I suggest you name it DIDEROT Protocol. Wink, wink.
