You shuffle down a hallway that you didn’t know existed, looking for a department you’ve never heard of before. That’s not an unusual occurrence for auditors at the biggest site in the SCP Foundation; you’ve run all over the place tracking down the various expenses of this or that department, all in the name of keeping spending down and productivity up. Today was unusual, though, because you’re the third auditor to try and find this particular department. Your two predecessors are convinced that the department doesn’t exist, but the boss made it clear that failure wouldn’t be tolerated a third time. So here you are, clipboard in hand, running around like a chicken with no head, making wrong turn after wrong turn, hitting deadend after deadend…

And then you find it.

Two inconspicuous wooden doors at the very end of the most out-of-the-way hallway in the entire Foundation, one of which bears a small nameplate reading:

The Department of Everyday Anomalies and Disinformation

of Explained, Neutralized, and Decommissioned SCPs

… which tells you absolutely nothing about what this department actually does. You’re pretty sure the Foundation doesn’t even decommission SCPs anymore. Below the nameplate is a sticky note with 

“Welcome to the Deadend!”

 scribbled on it. You take a deep breath, hoping that this is not, in fact, a deadend, and…

You knock on the door.

You don’t knock on the door.
