###### **Special Containment Procedures**
  
SCP-5181-1, -2, & -3 are contained in individual Class A humanoid containment chambers in the Secure Containment Block at Site-12. Each chamber has been modified to allow for a continuous audio-visual feed of the other two chambers. At no point should this feed be interrupted, nor should the 5181-entities be prevented from viewing it at any time. 
The 5181-entities are restricted to a vegetarian diet. At no point are they to be supplied with any dietary supplements that are not included on Meal Plan V-102.
As per ECOM.ord.00187, testing on SCP-5181 has been permanently suspended. Inquiries and proposed testing procedures are to be submitted in writing to the Site-12 Ethics Committee representative.
Due to the complexity of operations during recovery of SCP-5181, attempts to completely remove references to the 5181-entities had mixed results. While the propaganda and disinformation campaigns in Europe were largely successful, references to SCP-5181 in the US media and common knowledge were already so wide-spread that complete removal of such were deemed detrimental to overall Foundation operations and were ultimately discarded.
In lieu of complete erasure, the attempts to spread the "Teufelshunde" or "Devil Dogs" moniker across the entirety of the US Marine Corps has seen significant success, while references to the 1st Battalion, 5th Marines Cheyenne Company have largely been eradicated.

###### **Description**
  
SCP-5181 refers collectively to a group of biologically and thaumaturgically enhanced humanoids recovered from the Belleau Wood area north and west of Château-Thierry, France. Originally contained by Foundation assets embedded within the United States 2nd Infantry Division in July, 1918. 
Despite the length of their containment, the three surviving members of the SCP-5181 group have shown no signs of advanced age. While testing on the matter has proven inconclusive, it is believed that the 5181-entities are all biologically immortal, and have shown no degeneration in their physical and cognitive capabilities.
5181-entities all display significantly enhanced physical characteristics, each showcasing dexterity, endurance, and physical strength far superior to that of a baseline human. Additionally, each subject presents with advanced cases of terminal hypertrichosis[1](javascript:;) as well as multiple musculoskeletal abnormalities. While a majority of these abnormalities are subcutaneous and not readily apparent, all of the 5181-entities exhibit extensive reformations of the skull and facial structures.

###### **Discovery**

SCP-5181 Discovery Location, C. 1918
In March, 1918, the German Army pushed an offensive west into Allied territories in an attempt to win the war on the Western Front before the United States armed forces had an opportunity to fully deploy. By May of that year, the German offensive had reached the north bank of the Marne River at the small village of Château-Thierry where they encountered the US 3rd Army Division. This forced the German advance to turn west towards the commune of Vaux.
That evening the Germans defeated elements of the French armed forces, which allowed them to move into position to flank the US military. In response, the 1st Battalion, 5th Marines, including the highly decorated Cheyenne Company, moved to intercept along the Paris-Metz highway. After having conducted an all-night forced march to achieve their position, the 1st Batt. Marines were exhausted and ill-prepared to fend off an all-out assault by the German offensive.
Despite this, the Marines were able to hold the position and eventually launch sufficient counter attacks that drove the Germans into entrenched defenses in the Belleau Woods. After several days of intense fighting, the Germans were pushed out of the Belleau Woods with both sides suffering heavy casualties.
In the aftermath of these engagements, the Foundation received a request from US High Command requesting assistance in retrieving elements of the 1st Battalion that had "gone rogue" and were continuing to engage any forces that entered Belleau Woods, regardless of allegiance. Lt. Major Jeremy Stevens, a Foundation field operative embedded with the 1st Battalion took command of a retrieval operation, which resulted in the deaths of 15 Foundation agents and the acquisition of SCP-5181.
###### **Additional Research**
Cheyenne Company, 1st Battalion, 5th Marines, USMC  
---  
Cheyenne Company is a disavowed company that was originally part of the 1st Battalion, 5th Marines in the United States Marine Corps based out of Camp Pendleton, California. Originally designated as a special field operations company, it was made up of special forces marines, occult sciences division operatives, and various paramilitary units.
#### Relevant History
As the United States watched World War 1, US High Command recognized both that the US would ultimately be drawn into the conflict as well as the need for highly specialized elements to counter occult and fringe science units within the Imperial German Army. Reports of highly capable paranormal units operating on the Western Front was concerning to US High Command, and which began to covertly prepare paranormal elements of their own. Initially sanctioned by elements within the Foundation's administration, Cheyenne Company was formed in July, 1914 as a test vehicle for the Special Sciences Division, a product of the SCPF/USAF joint sciences agreement. The US military's insistence on weaponizing certain components of the Foundation's growing inventory of anomalous artifacts drew it into direct conflict with the Foundation's Charter. In December of 1914, the Foundation withdrew from the joint sciences agreement with the United States, and the US officially disbanded the Special Sciences Division in February of 1915. In May, 1917, Cheyenne Company was reactivated and deployed to France as part of the US deployment strategy to halt the German advance along the Western Front.

**Engagements:**  
World War 1 -  
Battle of Belleau Wood  
---|---  
While ostensibly under the Command of Captain John Fitzgerald, Cheyenne Company was the pet project of Dr. Fyoder Kovalenko, a parasciences specialist and Ukrainian immigrant. Little is known about Dr. Kovalenko, though what intelligence that does exists suggests that he was involved in a variety of para-occult and fringe science experiments, and may have had ties with the nascent Neo-Sarkic cult known as The Hunter's Black Lodge.
The stated purpose of Cheyenne Company was to combat their counterparts within the German Imperial Army, though this was quickly subverted by Dr. Kovalenko's personal projects into achieving personal apotheosis by utilizing a fusion of parascientific experimentation with "traditional" Neo-Sarkic ritual.
While instrumental in the battle of Belleau Wood, US High Command was forced to disavow Cheyenne Company in the aftermath of that engagement, and the USMC purged all records of Cheyenne Company from their archives. This, and the Foundation's own efforts to discredit and erase all knowledge of their existence resulted in the near-total loss of all records relating to Dr. Kovalenko and his research.

**SCPF Internal Memorandum**
  
**FROM:** Dr. Marie Gilburn, Ethics Committee  
**TO:** Dr. Guillome Ribière, Site-12 Director  
**DATE:** 18 May 1940  
**RE:** SCP-5181 
* * *
I want to make myself very clear. You had no right, morally or legally, to activate SCP-5181. Doing so not only cost the lives of four of the SCP-5181 entities, but those of your containment staff, 14 of Site-12 Security personnel, and an unknown amount of civilians.
This is precisely why we don't get involved with the political affairs of mundane governments. I realize that you were acting out of an interest to preserve lives, but these men are no longer soldiers and you have no business putting them into the field. Your rash and inexcusable actions caused infinitely more harm than good, and your beloved France will ultimately have to pay for your actions.
SCP-5181 cannot be controlled, and your attempts to do so has cost the lives of men under your command. This is exactly what Order 187 was meant to prevent.
I expect your resignation within the hour.
Dr. Marie Gilburn  
Director, Ethics Committee

June 2, 1918
  
  
We marched through the night, but managed to get here just in time. The French ran away, but the Doc says that we're right where we should be. The Captain asked him if we were going to finish taking the injections, but Doc said to wait. Once we do, there wont be any turning back. So, we wait. Along with the rest of the 1/5.  

June 4, 1918
  
  
We kicked the shit out of them Kraut bastards. We had just enough time to dig little half-graves in the dirt before they started pouring over the hill and into our enfilade. We waited, then we killed. The sound of all those guns going off still rings in my ears. Almost enough to drown out the screaming. It's quiet now, but that isn't gonna last. The Captain says  

June 6, 1918
  
  
This morning we assaulted 142 and finally took it, but a lot of good men wont be going home. The Captain and Doc got into it and the Doc agreed to let us finish. We're being shifted to help 3/6 take Belleau, and the Captain says now is the time. Doc gave us all syringes filled with blood and told us to inject ourselves after we move in with 3/6. The others don't quite know what to make of it, but we're goddamn War Dogs. Whatever comes, we got this.  

June 7, 1918
  
  
My whole body feels like its on fire. The pain is spiking through everything, but I ain't ever felt so alive. I can hear everything. I can taste the sweat and rust from the Krauts on the breeze blowing through Bellau. I can feel the beating hearts of my brothers in the hair on my arms. I feel **strong** , stronger than ever I've been. The weariness of sleep is gone, but the hunger remains. I can taste it in my mouth, and I can see it running in their veins. I must.  

June 10, 1918
  
  
We've killed and killed and killed, and the hunger still drives me. War dogs? We're not war dogs anymore. The Krauts are calling us Teufelshunde now. Devil dogs. The pride in that is almost enough for me to forget the hunger. Almost enough for me to forget the fear in the eyes of the other Marines. Almost.  

June 11, 1918
  
  
They're not afraid. They're jealous. Jealous of what we've become. Jealous of what we can do. We've taken the woods. They belong to us now, and no one's gonna take them from us. No one is gonna take anything from us ever again.
