Special Containment Procedures:

 Not enough is currently known about SCP-5855 manifestations to effectively contain SCP-5855 upon manifestation. For this reason, short-term containment efforts should focus on administering Class G amnestics to individuals who have seen SCP-5855 but were unaffected by SCP-5855's non-anomalous antimemetic property.

Permanent containment efforts have been directed towards the finalization of Operation: TV DINNER. Upon completion of Operation: TV DINNER and observation of its effectiveness, special containment procedures are to be revised.

Description:

 SCP-5855 is the collective designation for a variety of anomalous fruit bearing one or more human organs/appendages. SCP-5855 instances are sentient and ambulatory, re-positioning themselves by rolling, hopping, or using their human limbs. SCP-5855 instances manifest in close proximity to individuals (hereafter referred to as SCP-5855-A) who have artistic or creative backgrounds

 and are affected by one or more of the following:

Severe sleep deprivation.

High fever.

Hallucinogenic drugs.

Psychosis.

SCP-5855-A instances often deny that their perceptions of SCP-5855 are accurate, instead believing that they had misidentified non-anomalous fruit or were dreaming. This effect has been deemed non-anomalous.

SCP-5855-A instances frequently create art depicting SCP-5855, which de-manifest soon after SCP-5855-A's "spark of inspiration".

Addendum 02 - Proposition by Head Researcher Turner:

Head Researcher Turner's analysis of SCP-5855 manifestations discovered the following patterns:

There is a minimum of 6 months between every SCP-5855 manifestation.

The length of time between manifestations (not including the initial 6 months) appears related to the style in which SCP-5855 was depicted.

The length of the demanifestation period is positively correlated with how realistic the depiction of SCP-5855 is and how central said depiction is to the piece's overall composition.

Considering this information, along with SCP-5855's previously-documented sentience and tendency to manifest in the presence of artistic/creative individuals, the following explanation for SCP-5855's behavior have been hypothesized:

SCP-5855 instances manifest with the intent of being artistically depicted.

SCP-5855 has a preference for realistic artstyles and depictions that focus on SCP-5855.

The length of SCP-5855 demanifestations correlate with how "satisfied" SCP-5855 is with its depiction.

By depicting SCP-5855 during a demanifestation period, one could extend the length of time that SCP-5855 is "satisfied", delaying future manifestations.

To test this hypothesis and more effectively contain SCP-5855, Operation: TV DINNER was proposed.

OPERATION: TV DINNER

Primary Objective:

 Prevent SCP-5855 manifestations.

Secondary Objectives:

 Create an additional source of Foundation funding. If Operation: TV DINNER fails to prevent all SCP-5855 manifestations, inoculate the public to images of fruit with human organs. This will reduce the likelihood of the veil being broken by SCP-5855 manifestations.

Course of Action:

 A Foundation shell company is to produce and frequently publish new depictions of SCP-5855 to the public. These are to take the form of an episodic television show, allowing new content (and subsequently new depictions of SCP-5855) to be created indefinitely. The main characters of this series (who are to be on-screen as often as possible) will be fruit bearing multiple external human organs. These organs are to be digitally transposed onto their surfaces (skin, peel, rind, etc.) by a team of editors. If necessary for plot coherence, Head Researcher Turner may appear as an in-universe character.

A prototype image demonstrating the realistic artstyle of the finished product has been attached at the end of this document.
