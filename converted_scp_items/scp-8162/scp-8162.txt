Description:

 SCP-8162 is a thaumatological phenomena that developed in the 17th Century until the year 1910. The anomaly affects the House of Braganza,

1

 rulers of both the Portuguese Empire (1640 — 1910), United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and Algarves (1815 — 1822) and Brazilian Empire (1822 — 1889). The item affected every branch of the royal family during their ruling, with the anomaly ceasing in the decade of 1910, after the last remaining Braganza monarch was deposed and the Kingdom of Portugal ended in favor of a republic.

SCP-8162 caused the premature death of House of Braganza heirs by means of illness, with the effect beginning at a random moment. All victims died before they had a chance to ascend to the throne. Although the affliction went unidentified, its symptoms consisted of fever and delirious episodes. All subjects perished within a month of symptoms manifesting.

Once the subject is ill, SCP-8162 will start its manifestation, leading to a series of anomalous events.

The following is a list of general events associated with the manifestation of SCP-8162 and its consequences. The different occurrences have been registered by Academy researchers and by the Braganza family for the two centuries of SCP-8162 activity.

First Week.

 Portugal’s sea level rises to a maximum of 2 meters. The remains of various fish belonging to non-native species begin to manifest on the coastline; these do not de-manifest and need to be manually removed. Precipitation levels go up all over the country up to 50% above the expected level.

Second Week.

 Storms become more frequent in the general area of all Portuguese territories, independent of previous atmospheric conditions. Frequently, the Braganzas claim seeing various visions after looking at the sky or the sea during the second week. Any Braganza on a body of water during this time will become comatose during the rest of the event, being unaffected by other anomalous phenomena related to SCP-8162.

Third Week.

 The Braganza family becomes unable to digest food and suffer a complete appetite loss. Disembodied voices can be heard on properties belonging to the Braganzas, reportedly coming from the walls, ground and water sources. All members of the family currently in a ruling position will vomit sea water in regular intervals, stopping after expelling about 2 liters. Remains of native sea fauna are found in various places in the Braganza’s chambers.

Fourth Week.

 One city on the coastline of a Portuguese territory will vanish. No traces of its population or buildings can be found afterwards.

Shortly after the death of the heir, SCP-8162 will stop its activity until its activation requirements are fulfilled again. No vestigial traces of the thaumaturgic nature of the event can be traced or identified after SCP-8162 kills its target. The Braganzas had employed the now defunct Group of Interest know as the Scientific Academy of the Anomalous

2

 to research and terminate the thaumic effect. The team was initially headed by Luís 

Cipíro

 II, professor in the Academy and patriarch of the Cipíro family.

 Recovered Document

EXCERPT — LUÍS CIPÍRO’S LETTER ON SCP-8162

I write for whomever is in my position after my passing. His Majesty suffers from a great and ominous debilitating condition. Evil forces have interposed themselves on the natural order and now we must deal with this evil and ward it away from the royal family. My writing is only to the eyes of my successor, neither lesser thaumatuges nor His Majesty himself is to be made wise to the content. Before any judgement, I must make clear that some information has to be kept away from royal blood for reasons the next in line is sure to understand.

[…]

The Braganzas have been cursed, that much is clear, however the origin of said evil has been concealed. Not that the truth is concealed somehow. On the contrary, we have no shortage of those skilled in Divination, but we are forbidden from seeking this information. In a discussion with His Majesty, he insisted that no one must know the source of this malicious spell. Persuasion was of little use.

We would be, of course, capable of discovering every detail that is written on the Mana coursing through the curse's development, but I will not allow it. Keeping this information a secret, once found, could indeed be accomplished. But all my colleagues, myself included, wish to follow what was previously discussed.

It's foolish to argue, however, that examining the source would not be fruitful in aiding attempts to combat the ill effects of the spell and maybe end its hold on the Braganza family. I state here that whoever takes my position after my passing has my blessing to pursue such matters if you so desire.

If this route is pursued, may you have good fortune.

[…]

Document Analysis

Compiled by Ernesto Cipíro and Natalício de Borges Wilson of PT:2387

— From 1640 to 1910 —

Professor Marcondes Cipíro II, head of the organization during 1910.

A group of specialized thaumaturges from multiple origins (mainly the Academy) was organized with the objective of fulfilling specific needs of the ruling monarchs. This group was focused on developing countermeasures for SCP-8162 and its activity.

During the group's centuries long existence, it was unable to contain or neutralize SCP-8162, leaving extensive documentation and thaumaturgic treaties about curses. Although the thaumaturges did not fully understand the anomaly, the materials they produced were highly relevant to the unification of the

Document #1

 Diary of Professor Bernardo Caminha, 1736.

[…] Today was my last attempt to break the curse afflicting His Majesty.

The affliction comes from a very powerful source, not like that of mortal hands. Classic abjuration magic has been exhausted. Protection seals, talismans, and more. As a sorcerer with pride in this specific field, I have found difficulty in finding solutions not yet proven to be futile against the powerful evil.

After experimentation, three attempts of exorcism have taken place. Mine was the fourth. The first one by Professor and Duke Abrantes Homem, followed by Professor Abraão Cipíro, and the third by Father Percival Amado and Professor Neuza Cipíro III. Some of the reasons for failure are yet elusive, but my beloved apprentices have compiled various sources through divination magic.

Duke Homem was selected from a decaying line of both nobility and sorcery. His most notable achievement, the position of Head Thaumaturge in charge of His Majesty’s curse was, as it turns out, attained through connections and favors collected by him under various academic, financial and military circumstances. I hear the Duke was also in his way to engage a Braganza In marriage.

In the Duke's time as head, information was limited, and later we found that the noble was worried about investigating the origins of His Majesty's vile curse in all ways. A nobleman with a fragile status as himself could not, he thought, damage his relations with the Braganza House in any way. In his unbearable fear, Abrantes attempted an exorcism of the curse. This, for his dread, resulted in not only the demise of his house, but the end of his academic prestige.

Few testimonies give substantial descriptions of the event, but as far as it is known Homem used various Roman traditions, calling upon old gods. Abrantes attempted to call upon the aid of Vênus [Venus], the goddess that loves the Portuguese. The Duke also attempted to summon the powers of Júpiter [Jupiter] and Marte [Mars]. However, this did not succeed.

Júpiter sent a powerful lightning strike, Marte strong winds and Vênus only her silence. Not only did the curse remain, but somehow this angered the gods that are so useful in rituals in other moments. Abrantes found himself incapable of having not only a healthy male heir, but all kinds of children, and all the noblemen present suffered the same. Abrantes Homem did not leave records of the reasoning behind all the exorcism details. Necromancers have used sorcery to question, but the Duke's spirit found itself indisposed. Independent of anything, the noble’s exorcism plans have also not been preserved.

Abraão Cipíro, who attempted the second exorcism, was an abjuration professor in the Academy. He is the main reason almost all the abjuration techniques have been exhausted at this point in time. Like all members of the Cipíro family, Abraão was subject to an unknown death curse that would lead him to die at the peak of his thaumaturgic ability. Almost all Cipíros that studied at the Academy were selected to work for His Majesty due to the alchemical, mystical, and demonological proficiency found in their blood.

Abraão had wonderful record keeping. His work included an extensive and meticulous study in curse countermeasures. His knowledge, however, failed to save His Majesty's offspring. The abjuracionist's attempt at exorcism was a complex concealment of a curse's target though forceful means. This machination, however, could not be finished before the Cipíro death curse took its toll on Abraão. The mage went mad and progress was lost. His writing was full of fear of storms, the sea, and a horrendous giant god that ate a whole continent. His research became deeper as his madness grew.

The Professor indeed found various pertinent details, but his madness can't be easily separated from his more coherent work. After his attempts, the following two exorcisms are more uneventful.

[…]

With all this I can't be sure in my attempts. The Roman gods and known abjuration are of no aid. Intervention of religious miracles was unable to be used when Father Percival used the power of holy reliques. Attempting to appease the source of this vile power is unlikely, even if this possibility offered by Professor Neuza is a likely outcome. In all honesty, my attempt is a desperate cluster of these past methods.

 

Document #2

 Testimony of an unknown Portuguese thaumaturge, 1800.

I have never felt such strange and otherworldly feelings in my heart as of the last few days.

This writing is not only to organize my thoughts into coherent lines, but to make absolutely sure I do not forget a single detail of the past Divination sessions.

On orders of the Head Mage, readings on all incidents and developments resulting from the Braganza curse have been ordered. With permission of my superiors I engaged in an emotional reading, attempting to reconstitute whatever intentions lay behind the spell, as in accordance with the latest developments. As it is understood, a magical creature is the source of this predicament, and an extraordinarily powerful one.

Attempting to understand the emotional context I found myself in fear. Behind the layers of magic there was a sincere hatred, the most sincere rage and angst I have ever felt. Man is a creature of much hate, but in a smaller way than this magical being. Its feelings are not only the most honest truth, but it has no other qualities. It is a pure emotion. Absolute. I see a vortex with no end, a raging storm that expands beyond all worlds, its water forcing its way across every construction, flooding not only cities, but overpowering the whole ground, destroying all the continent, eating all the world.

The conquest of this storm has no end, it takes the whole globe, leaving not a single island, continent or structure. It all is swallowed into the ocean. Once in the ocean all dies. Every mortal and immortal, god and man, noble and peasant are bent and destroyed in all ways possible. No fish, sea monster or sea god can escape this hate too, this rage swallows all that lives, unlives and will live. This giant has no size, in the sense that his rage has grown so large it can crush and corrupt all that lives. This magical creature is immeasurable.

And all this weight that has grown too large to have a limit falls not all over the world, not over all Europe, not over all Portugal, but only on the Braganzas. It's so large yet its target is so small.

This weight is all there is, ever.

Interviewer:

 Dr. Natalicio de Borges Wilson

Interviewed:

 [REDACTED]

5

Dr. Wilson:

 Has it been difficult?

[REDACTED]:

 Almost gone. I guess soon there will be no sign of the Curse left. Not that our lives are easy.

Dr. Wilson:

 Lots of people would argue you are lucky.

[REDACTED]:

 Maybe.

Dr. Wilson:

 You know, Prince, I am not a thaumaturge. There are a few working here, and they say SCP-8162 is still active through some residual force.

[REDACTED]:

 The curse has no reason to be here anymore.

Dr. Wilson:

 Continue.

[REDACTED]:

 I believe it was a will of some sort.

Dr. Wilson:

 Come again?

[REDACTED]:

 I'm not saying anything wrong.

Dr. Wilson:

 And the Foundation is all-ears. But as of yet, we cannot account for something we have not confirmed.

[REDACTED]:

 Good to know you all are at least looking into it. You have no wizards, no power, less money then the glory days.

Dr. Wilson:

 Let’s focus on the relevant matter. Did you hear voices again?

[REDACTED]:

 No.

Dr. Wilson:

 What about appetite loss?

[REDACTED]:

 No.

Dr. Wilson:

 Your daughter?

[REDACTED]:

 Stop, Natalício. Can we drop the formalities for a moment?

Dr. Wilson:

 For?

[REDACTED]:

 It's over.

Dr. Wilson:

 What makes you say that?

[REDACTED]:

 Just figured I should admit our situation. The curse is gone. It’ll never come back. There was always something… A “pressure” over all of us. There was this heavy sensation that always existed. Then, three days ago, the feeling just… went away.

Silence.

Dr. Wilson:

 The Foundation will take your claims… feelings, into consideration. If the anomaly has been neutralized you will be the first civilian to know.

[REDACTED]:

 See you next month?

Dr. Wilson:

 Just one more thing. This question was not planned before the interview, but… I believe this time it will not be a problem.

[REDACTED]:

 Sure.

Dr. Wilson:

 Where does this pressure, this weight, come from?

[REDACTED]:

 I… I have no idea.

Dr. Wilson:

 Okay. This concludes our interview–

[REDACTED]:

 It's everything my family ever did.

Dr. Wilson:

 Hm.

[REDACTED]:

 We never told anyone.

Dr. Wilson:

 That is okay.

[REDACTED]:

 As monarchs we did many things. We ordered many things. Good, bad or horrible, it was all up to the king. This curse is so heavy… the weight of the whole sea over my head.

Dr. Wilson:

 A lot of mages talked about the curse coming from the sea. Some monster of pure evil.

[REDACTED]:

 He is a giant. Immense. Intense. Cold. An old existence. The sea is indifferent to everything except us. All but us. Our damn crown. Like an oil slick of pure… pure hate. Something ancient. Something that does not have the name of god or demon. Just anger.

Silence.

[REDACTED]:

 He could take cities as he pleased, swallow a whole population. If the giant desired He would eat the whole world. The weight was His anger. His contained rage. Always there, just below the surface, following our ships. And every time one of ours… an heir prepared to take the crown, that rage would rise. Pour out. And take a piece of our empire, 

a city

.

Dr. Wilson:

 And now, you don't feel it anymore?

[REDACTED]:

 No. When the Republic came… when there was no king anymore… no crown to covet… the weight disappeared. He withdrew. Like a wave going back out to sea. No more target. No more reason.

Dr. Wilson:

 And how does that make you feel? The absence of that… pressure?

[REDACTED]:

 (Long silence) Empty. So empty. The weight was terrible, but it was… real. It was the price for everything. Now that there's no price… I wonder if what we were… what we did… really mattered to anything but Him. And now that He's gone… I'm just a man. Without weight. Without a kingdom. Just… small.

Dr. Wilson:

 We will continue to monitor your family. This concludes our interview.
