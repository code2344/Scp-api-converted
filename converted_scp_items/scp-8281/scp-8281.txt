SCP-8281

Containment Procedures:

 SCP-8281 is to be kept in a standard storage locker at Site 24. Outside of testing, the item is only to be handled with gloves.

Description:

 SCP-8281 is a ceramic egg, presumably constructed as a table lantern. When a subject touches SCP-8281, they are transformed into a new physical form over the course of five seconds. The nature of individualized transformations appear arbitrary, but are hypothesized to relate to the subject in some way. Once transformed, SCP-8281 no longer affects the subject.

The transformation process is reported to be both painless and pleasant by any subjects who retain the ability to communicate following exposure to the object.

Test Log

Site Director Maine has approved human experiments with D-class personnel. Agents Thomson and Bashar are tasked with clearing the testing chamber between experiments. The primary purpose of the following 25 tests is to:

Gain a detailed understanding of the psychological impact of transformations triggered by SCP‑8281,

Confirm whether SCP-8281 can convert humans into anomalies, and

Investigate patterns to determine the nature of SCP-8281's transformations.

The following logs are automatically generated by the AI construct Bardeen.aic. Subjects were separately interviewed (where possible) by Researcher Xi Ping.
