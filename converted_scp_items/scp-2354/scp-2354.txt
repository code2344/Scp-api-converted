Foundation personnel retrieving the corpse of 63 year old Orin Petersen, 10/12/1988. Believed to have been the site of one of SCP-2354’s first manifestations.

Item #:

 SCP-2354

Object Class:

 Keter

Special Containment Procedures:

 Lack of knowledge regarding SCP-2354 has made direct containment infeasible. Containment efforts should instead focus on monitoring likely targets of SCP-2354 and attempting to preempt the entity. This policy is to continue until more effective containment procedures can be developed.

Description:

 SCP-2354 is an anomalous ambush predator targeting individuals who have recently experienced the death or disappearance of a loved one.

SCP-2354 is believed to stalk a given subject for an extended period of time, variably ranging from three weeks to six months, before luring its target to an isolated location and bludgeoning them to death. SCP-2354 will then lacerate the subject post-mortem, typically by removing a single body part

. The significance of this process is unknown.

Beyond these factors, little is known about SCP-2354’s appearance, movements, or current whereabouts. Although initially attributed to a series of non-anomalous serial killings, the inexplicably broad range of SCP-2354 manifestations has made the likelihood of anomalous influence a near certainty.

Incident Log:

 The following is an abridged record of deaths connected to SCP-2354 and descriptions of their circumstances.
