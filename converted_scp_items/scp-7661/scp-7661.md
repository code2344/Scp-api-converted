SCP-7661 in containment.
**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7661 is to be contained in Site-56's Vehicle Containment Garage. Instances of SCP-7661-A are to be apprehended and contained in standard humanoid chambers at Site-56.
Foundation assets are to monitor road traffic collision data to predict the creation of new SCP-7661-A instances. Newly created instances are to be retrieved from SCP-7661, interviewed, then transported to containment.
**Description:** SCP-7661 is a 2002 Nissan X-terra sports utility vehicle consistent with those produced at the Nissan Smyrna Assembly Plant in Tennessee, USA. No records exist of its manufacture; a plaque reading "Courtesy Vehicle" is located where the windshield VIN plate would be. SCP-7661 otherwise operates similarly to a non-anomalous automobile.
SCP-7661 will undergo an anomalous event when any 2002 Nissan X-terra is involved in a road traffic collision in which the driver is terminated as a direct result. An exact duplicate of the driver, designated SCP-7661-A, will manifest within SCP-7661 between 21 and 37 hours following the driver’s death. All instances of SCP-7661-A are physically and genetically identical to their terminated counterpart and possess memories that the latter would have.

_It is 13:29 EST. Engstrom Street is devoid of activity._
_SCP-7661 turns onto the street and stops in front of a gray one-story house. A figure, later identified as SCP-7661-A-1, steps out of the SUV and closes the door behind it._

**Transcript 7661-4**
**Date:** July 25, 2003
**Location:** Kyuzhevitz, North Carolina, USA

**< Begin Log>**
_Epsilon-33 agents Timothy Polot, Stacy Stafford, and Clezheimer Nelson approach the house. They are dressed in Kyuzhevitz Police uniforms. Two more agents are preparing to load SCP-7661 onto a Foundation flatbed tow truck._
**Polot:** Alright team, one last reminder. Repeat after me: "Mackenzie Macrada".
**Stafford and Nelson:** Mackenzie Macrada.
**Polot:** "Accident investigation."
**Stafford and Nelson:** Accident investigation.
_The three agents take deep breaths as Agent Polot knocks on the front door._
**Polot:** Kyuzhevitz Police Department! We have some questions for a "Mrs. Macrada".
_The door opens to reveal an elderly woman._
**Woman:** Hello?
**Polot:** Hello, ma'am. We need to talk to Mackenzie about the accident she was in about a week ago.
**Woman:** What do you mean? She's completely fine. I… I thought I lost her, but…
**Nelson:** Right, but there's been… a discrepancy over who's at fault, so we're here to ask her more about it.
**Woman:** Um… alright then.
_The woman turns around. Behind her, a young boy and girl are visible._
**Woman:** Mackenzie! The police are here to ask you about that accident!
_SCP-7661-A-1 peers from around a corner._
**SCP-7661-A-1:** That's odd… cops?
_SCP-7661-A-1 walks towards the front door as the elderly woman and children watch._
**Polot:** Hello, Mrs. Macrada. We need you to come down to the station to discuss that accident you were involved in. Don't worry, you're not under arrest or anything.
**SCP-7661-A-1:** Oh… the accident.
**Nelson:** It's just gonna take a couple hours. It's for… insurance purposes?
**SCP-7661-A-1:** Um… okay, officers.
_The two children begin to approach SCP-7661-A-1._
**Boy:** Mom, mom, why are the police taking you?
_SCP-7661-A-1 kneels down to eye level with the children as the agents watch silently._
**SCP-7661-A-1:** They just need to talk to me about the accident last week, Dustin.
**Girl:** But Mommy, you're okay!
**SCP-7661-A-1:** Oh Rachel, it's just… adult stuff. I'll explain when you're older.
**Stafford:** Um… Miss, we're on a bit of a tight schedule…
**SCP-7661-A-1:** Oh, I see. _< to the children>_ I'll be back soon, stay put with Grandma.
_The children attempt to hug SCP-7661-A-1, but are blocked by Agent Polot._
**Polot:** Don't worry kids, your mother will be back soon.
**Boy:** Oh… okay, officer.
**Girl:** _< waving to SCP-7661-A-1>_ Bye, mommy!
_SCP-7661-A-1 waves back as it exits the house and is escorted by Agent Nelson to the Foundation-borrowed police cruiser._
_Agent Polot exchanges glances with Agent Stafford._
_Stafford nods, and the two face the elderly woman as the children watch._
**Polot:** While my partner takes Mackenzie in, we need to ask you some more questions. Mind if we come in?
**Woman:** What kind of questions?
_As Agent Polot recites his answers, Agent Stafford approaches the children._
**Boy:** Officer, when's our mom gonna be done with the questions?
**Girl:** When will Mommy come back?
_Agent Stafford does not respond._
**Boy:** Officer?
_The elderly woman becomes agitated with Agent Polot._
**Woman:** Sir, I _do not_ understand why you need to enter my home.
_Agent Polot remains silent as he takes out his can of Class-B aerosol amnestics from his pocket. The woman notices._
**Woman:** What… what is that?
_Agent Polot administers the amnestics in the elderly woman's face._
_The woman's mouth opens agape as she breathes in the amnestics. Stafford and the children gasp as they watch._
**Boy:** G- Grandma? What are you doing to my grandma?
**Girl:** _Grandma!_
_Agent Polot turns around towards Agent Stafford and the children, who appear distressed. Polot runs towards them, amnestics can in hand._
**Boy:** What did you do to-
_Agent Polot sprays the amnestic aerosol can in the boy's face. The girl begins to cry._
_Agent Stafford steps back as Polot administers the amnestics in the girl's face._
_The two children cease commotion and stand in a slight daze._
_The agents look back at the elderly woman, who has slumped to the floor. Polot runs to her and checks her pulse._
**Polot:** _Shit,_ I thought she was dead for a second…
_Agent Polot looks back at Agent Stafford._
**Polot:** Why didn't you- why didn't you use your amnestics? You were just standing there!
**Stafford:** I just- I didn't really… um…
**Polot:** You _need_ to get used to spraying that stuff, no way around it.
**Stafford:** It's just that… we just-
**Polot:** Every second counts.
_Agent Polot picks up the elderly woman and carries her to a sofa as Agent Stafford watches._
_Polot sets the woman down on the sofa, then grabs the two children to sit them down next to the Woman._
**Stafford:** I'm sorry.
_Agent Polot looks at Agent Stafford and sighs._
**Polot:** Remember your training next time, Stafford.
_The two agents walk towards the front door. Agent Stafford glances behind her at the children and elderly woman sitting docile on the sofa._
_The agents exit the house, closing the door behind them._
