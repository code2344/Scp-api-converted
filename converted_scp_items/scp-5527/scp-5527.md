SCP-5527 in storage at Site-02
**Special Containment Procedures:** The remaining mass of SCP-5527 is to be kept in a refrigerated container at Site-02's morgue.
Further consumption of SCP-5527 is prohibited.
**Description:** SCP-5527 is a whale carcass, the innards of which resemble human physiology that has been augmented in a way to complement SCP-5527's shape and size. Various musculature and tissue inside SCP-5527, when applied to a living creature, would be rendered nonfunctional or otherwise superfluous in an aquatic environment.
Aside from a thick layer of fat surrounding its innards and the size of such, SCP-5527's anatomy— including skeletal structure, musculature, and the locations of internal organs— is identical to that of a human. Carbon dating techniques have revealed that SCP-5527 is approximately 30,000 years old. Despite this, SCP-5527 has not been observed to deteriorate beyond its present state. Traces of decayed ink have been observed on SCP-5527's left iliac artery.
Material derived from SCP-5527 will, upon consumption, allow for the ability to breathe in aquatic environments. This effect has been observed to last for up to 12 hours, and is otherwise poorly understood.
All DNA strands taken from SCP-5527 have been degraded beyond the point of analysis.
**Addendum.5527.1:** Discovery
SCP-5527 was found on 2021/01/01 when it washed ashore on Bintan Island, Indonesia, in front of a private estate belonging to Overseer Council member O5-12, who had been residing there at the time.
Upon request, SCP-5527 was transferred to Site-02[1](javascript:;) for research purposes.
**Addendum.5527.2:** Testing Log

* * *
**Test #:** 01
**Subject:** One _Peromyscus leucopus_ (white mouse)
**Notes:** Subject was prompted to consume a piece of SCP-5527's brain matter. Following consumption, it was placed in a small cage before being lowered into a tank of water.
* * *
**Results:** Subject remained underwater for 4 hours before expiring. Signs of distress were observed throughout the process.
  

* * *
**Test #:** 07
**Subject:** Researcher Avalon
**Notes:** Subject was instructed to consume a piece of SCP-5527's pectoral tissue. Following consumption, subject was placed in a cage fitted with a safety system, and submerged in a body of water.
* * *
**Results:** Subject remained underwater for one hour before signalling for the cage to be raised. Aside from initial difficulties adjusting to breathing in both environments, no signs of distress or discomfort were observed.
Researcher Avalon was promptly interviewed and asked to describe her experience. An excerpt of her writing can be found below.
> _You lose all sense of who you are and where you are. When I was told I only lasted an hour, I didn't know how to respond. It felt like weeks. Like I fell asleep and dreamed for a month straight. At the same time, it wasn't dreaming. I was cognizant of what was happening, and I could reflect on things as clearly as I could see them in front of me. I relived my life a hundred times. Every regret, moment of bliss, and even the perspectives of those around me. I fixated on the parts of myself I don't like to think about. The whole time, there was a stinging feeling in the back of my neck that told me I was doing something wrong, or that I'm still doing something wrong._
Following the interview, Researcher Avalon requested amnesticization, which was denied in order to further observe the effects of consuming SCP-5527.

**Test #:** 010
**Subject:** One copy of children's book _The Cat in the Hat_ , written by Dr. Seuss
**Notes:** Subject was chosen due to a lack of water present in the narrative. Subject was forced to consume a piece of SCP-5527's tailbone through an anomalous process involving SCP-████ and was then submerged for a half hour.
* * *
**Results:** Upon review, the central narrative of this copy of _The Cat in the Hat_ had changed entirely. A summary can be found below.
> _The story begins in a house of 12 unnamed, nondescript children, who express boredom with their current situation. A loud noise is heard from the basement, and the character of the Cat in the Hat emerges from the cellar door. He promises to show the children ways to occupy themselves, but the children's pet fish objects. The Cat laughs, and removes the fish from its bowl. He replaces the bowl's water with a liquid he pours from underneath his hat. Upon reintroducing the fish to the bowl, it drowns. The children, now ecstatic without the presence of the sole supervising force in their lives, begin to vandalize the house, breaking objects and drawing on walls, among other destructive activities. The Cat offers to retrieve two beings, referred to as the "Things", from the basement to assist with the destruction. The children become immediately frightened— some to the point of tears— and beg the Cat to "leave [the Things] where they belong"._
> _As the Cat continues to threaten the children with going into the basement, an obscured figure is seen approaching the house from outside the window. The children realize the mess they've made, and panic. The Cat takes pleasure in their distress, and retreats into the basement. The obscured figure opens the front door, and the children begin to run. The book ends with a question posed to the reader; "What would you do if you could know the truth?"_
Further testing regarding SCP-5527 has been prohibited at the request of the O5 Council.

Incident Log
* * *
**Date:** 2021/01/12
* * *
At 00:25, Overseer Council member O5-12 accessed SCP-5527's containment locker and proceeded to consume a large amount of its innards, including the entirety of its brain, heart, eyes, and skeleton.
Following this, O5-12 proceeded to her residence on Bintar Island, where SCP-5527 had been discovered. Surveillance cameras reveal that O5-12 entered the nearby body of water and swam out to an indeterminate length, where it is assumed she submerged herself to the point of drowning.
After a search effort, O5-12's corpse was recovered on 2021/01/24. It was found embedded in the seabed, partially buried under sand. Various lacerations and markings were observed on the cadaver, as well as its clothing.
A search of O5-12's residence recovered the following document, hastily composed on a napkin following her consumption of SCP-5527.
> **Wow!** _We should be ashamed of ourselves. This is what we deserve._
> After popular demand, we've brought back a brand new set of Little Misters, a limited edition collection from Dr. Wondertainment! Isn't that fun?
> Find them all and become the Brand New Mr. Collector!
