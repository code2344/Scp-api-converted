**SCP-5562:** Shrewsbury Key
**Item No:** SCP-5562
**Containment Class:** Radix[1](javascript:;)
**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-5562 is to be stored in Containment Chamber 12 at Site-26. Foundation knowledge of the existence of SCP-5562 is not to be disclosed to the British Occult Service.
Use of SCP-5562 requires the approval of the Site-26 Director or Overseer Command. The input of the Ethics Committee is to be disregarded.
**Description:** SCP-5562 is a large metal cube, measuring 3 metres tall, discovered beneath the town hall of Shrewsbury, Shropshire, England. SCP-5562 has 1 entrance, which can only be opened by an adult British citizen. How SCP-5562 verifies this is unknown.
A brass plaque is located to the right of the entrance, which reads "PROPERTY OF THE DIRECTORATE OF MILITARY INTELLIGENCE, SECTIONS 13[2](javascript:;) AND 19[3](javascript:;)". A slot is located beneath this plaque.
Opening the entrance will result in the entrance automatically closing after a period of 20 seconds. Following this, the entrance will be unable to be opened for 50 seconds. Should an object have been present within SCP-5562, an envelope will be deposited from the slot. This envelope will contain all secret information contained within the inputted object.
No inputted objects have been present upon reopening SCP-5562.
