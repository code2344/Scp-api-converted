Item #:

 SCP-3059

Object Class:

 Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:

 SCP-3059 is to be held onsite at least 20 meters away from any and all physical texts, fiction and nonfiction. Foundation documentation is not allowed within 50 meters of SCP-3059.

Should any breach in containment occur, the incident must be logged immediately and reported to the current project overseer.

Description:

 SCP-3059 is an 18-year-old Hispanic male named Sam Micheals. SCP-3059 passively affects all fictional and nonfictional literature, written and digital, within 20 meters of it. Affected text is altered to include "Sam Micheals" in some form or the other, with texts closer to SCP-3059 being affected at a faster rate.

The speed at which the text is altered is tied directly to how close the text is to SCP-3059. Once the text has been in the presence of SCP-3059 for a sufficient amount of time, a character named Sam Micheals will appear within the text. All descriptions of the character have remained identical to the features of SCP-3059. While some texts do not progress further than "Sam Micheals" being mentioned, other texts may change to feature it as a much more major point within it. The importance of SCP-3059 within the text varies significantly, ranging from simply being named to replacing a major character within the story. Despite these changes, the plot rarely diverges from the original in any major fashion.

Any changes made to a text are reflected on every single copy of the text produced after the alteration has occurred. In certain texts, mainly nonfictional and historical texts, changes to it may also affect other documentation, creating fictitious persons in related media. These fictional people do not actually exist, with details about them often being obscure and vague, featuring only a single distinguishing feature or feat. Some examples can be seen below. For a current list of all affected texts, please see the current SCP-3059 project overseer.

 The Elements

Author:

Excerpt:

 And I have to thank my good friend, Sam Micheals. It was only with his help and love of the elements that I was able to foster my own. Sadly, he is currently going through great sickness, one that you don't recover from. I wish him luck in dealing with it and in what comes after.

Notes:

 Theodore Gray's body was found in his home. Although the outward appearance of the body possessed no abnormalities, the entire interior of the thoracic cavity had been reduced into a single mass of semi-gelatinous material made from the internal organs. Investigations in the circumstances of his death are currently underway.

My name is Sam. I feel you should know the name of the person who must do this to you.

 I know you do not want to be here and neither do I," the Talib said, "but this is my duty, 

hamishira

, so please kneel." Her bible verse was interupted. "What do you mean," Mariam said. The talib looked around in confusion, the gun in his hand replaced with a long knife. "

My name is Sam Micheals. Who are you?

" And in confusion, Mariam 

tore through them all.

Interviewer:

 Dr. Dartshire

Date:

<Begin Log>

Dr. Dartshire:

 Good morning SCP-3059. How are we doing today?

SCP-3059:

 Better, I guess.

Dr. Dartshire:

 Well that's good to hear. I'm going to ask you some questions now, so we can better understand your affliction, and hopefully stop it. Are you OK with that?

SCP-3059:

 Sure I guess.

Dr. Dartshire:

 Then let's begin. When did you discover this thing affecting you?

SCP-3059:

 I was born on August 15th, 1987. I had a family. A mom, a dad, a brother. I remember growing up with them, loving them. I don't know their names or their faces.

Dr. Dartshire:

 And how does this relate to your condition?

SCP-3059:

 I was there for 19 years of my life. I know this, I remember this. But everything is always…off, I guess.

Dr. Dartshire:

 What do you mean by 'off?'

SCP-3059:

 I don't belong here.

Dr. Dartshire:

 Really? Was there any particular area it hurt?

SCP-3059:

 What are you talking about?

Dr. Dartshire:

 And what about the bleeding?

SCP-3059:

 I never mentioned any bleeding.

Dr. Micheals:

 We're all bleeding.

Incident Report:

 3059-1

Date :

 13/10/2015

Location:

 "Valley of the Kings," Luxor, Egypt

Summary of Events:

8:32 AM:

 Several news outlets in Egypt report the discovery of a new tomb in the Valley of Kings, a location near Luxor, Egypt. The news outlets report that not only is it one of the largest discovered, it is mostly untouched. Foundation database intercept key word "Sam Micheals" and take over operations.

9:47 AM:

 Foundation operations take over unearthing the tomb. A small exploration team is sent in to determine any possible hazards. Once the team returns and gives the go ahead, a full exploration group, manned by MTF-Zeta-9 "Mole Rats," is formed and sent in.

10:11 AM:

 Reports from the exploration team begin. The tomb seems unfinished, with many dead ends and empty rooms. All glyphs found leading up to the main tomb are nonsensical.

11:58 AM:

 The main tomb is identified. Immediately in front of the entrance, a corpse is crouched at the doorway. Cause of death is attributed to the spear through the figure's chest. Despite the apparent age of the tomb, the corpse appears to have just been killed. Agent Sam Micheals shows distress over the body. The team continues attempting to open the door.

12:17 PM:

 The team enters the main tomb. A sarcophagus is found, completely featureless, roughly human shaped, and made out of iron. The team goes radio silent.

12:34 PM:

 Secondary team (MTF-Alpha-6 "Sam Micheals") reaches the position of the first team. 

My

 body is hanging from the ceiling, the dismembered bodies of the remaining MTF members scattered through the room. The limbs of each body, 

apart from my own

, are missing. The head of each body has been decapitated along the eyes. 

And I felt every cut.

??:1888 PM:

 

A growing figure is seen in the distance. A sky of scarlet and an expanse filled only with gray stone and bodies. I do not know what they are. I killed them all, yet still they refused to die. A cold, dreaded feeling through my chest. I look down, and poking through, the head of an ornate spear. I know the owner.

I look back up, and in front of me, the faces of 6 owls, each staring me down.

I feel tears running down my neck. They are not my own.

And then I am falling through my kingdom.

And then I am falling below what I called my home.

And then I am breaking into pieces.

But I am still whole.

And I am falling.

faster.

until it all shatters.

and then i am everywhere

Additional Notes:

 Test Results determined that there was a 98.6% match with SCP-3059.

All I see before me are the endless ashes of the fallen. I was once so much. Ash to ash. Dust to dust. I am all that is left. 

And all I can do is scream.
