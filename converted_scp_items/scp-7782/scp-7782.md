SCP-7782
**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7782 is kept in a specialized anomalous storage locker that prevents rotting.
**Description:** SCP-7782 is a sapient _gala_ apple capable of speech. The method by which it speaks is unknown.
**Discovery:** On February 14th 2023, SCP-7782 spontaneously manifested on Doctor Yellowstone's desk alongside a valentines day card with the text "You are the apple of my eye!" The following interaction was recorded by security cameras in Doctor Yellowstone's office.
> **< Begin Log>**
> **SCP-7782:** Hey there, doc. Some might bake you into an apple pie, but I'd bake you into a cutie pie.
> **Doctor Yellowstone:** Oh, hello. Thank you, I guess. How did you get in here?
> **SCP-7782:** I fell from the tree right into your basket[1](javascript:;). Speaking of which, if I saw you on a tree, I'd climb to the top just to pick you.
> **Doctor Yellowstone:** I'm flattered, but no thank you. Have you heard of the Smith-Malus anomalous scientific law? It states that "an apple a day keeps the doctor away."
> **SCP-7782:** Dang. Well, it was nice to meet you anyways!
> **< End Log>**
**Addendum 1:** As of July 17th 2023, SCP-7782 has made romantic advances towards fifty-three Foundation Personnel, twenty-two sapient SCP objects, and one picture of a potted plant. None of these individuals have reciprocated SCP-7782's advances, and it has not made advances towards individuals who have declined previously. Researcher Wadsworth offered to introduce it to one of the Foundation's artificial intelligences. However, SCP-7782 declined, as the artificial intelligences do not run on Apple-branded computers.
**Addendum 2:** To test how SCP-7782 interacts with mundane objects, a non-anomalous _red delicious_ apple was placed in its containment locker. The following was recorded after.
**< Begin Log>**
**SCP-7782:** Hey, Wadsworth. Who's that?
**Researcher Wadsworth:** That's an apple[2](javascript:;).
**SCP-7782:** She's the most beautiful girl I've ever seen. I'm gonna go talk to her.
_SCP-7782 rolls closer to the apple._
**SCP-7782:** Uh, hi. I'm Johnny.
_The apple is silent._
**SCP-7782:** I, um, just wanted to say I think you're beautiful.
_The apple remains silent._
**SCP-7782:** Do you want to get to know each other?
_The apple continues being silent._
**< End Log>**
  
The mundane apple remained in SCP-7782's containment locker at its request, and it continued to talk to the mundane apple despite the fact that the mundane apple has yet to verbally respond. 
**Addendum 3:** Two engagement rings were found embedded in SCP-7782 and the mundane apple a year following Addendum 2. Nine months after the previous event, an apple seed with a tiny pacifier was found in SCP-7782's containment locker.
