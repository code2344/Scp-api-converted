SCP-6226 posing for a picture.
**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-6226 is allowed to freely float around Aquatic Enclosure 6.
**Description:** SCP-6226 is a sentient rowboat behaving similarly to a non-anomalous _Balaeniceps rex_ (Shoebill). It uses its attached oars to ambulate through the water. It is very friendly with personnel and will float along the edge of its enclosure following anyone passing by its fence.
**Addendum-6226.1 Anomaly Transferral:**  
Due to the Boring Agreement, since SCP-6226 was discovered in Crater Lake, it is planned to be transferred to GoI-466 (Wilson's Wildlife Solutions) for documenting and care. A full document from WWS is expected upon its arrival.

We have come into the possession of a new anomaly. It was found swimming near the bank of Crater Lake so we are planning on sending it over to you.

Sounds like a plan! What sort of creature should we be expecting? What kind of enclosure does the little buddy need?

Most researchers here have described him as a shoebill. Quite docile. He even likes to follow around our staff when they come to greet him! I will attach a photo of the enclosure he is currently being kept in. I'm not really sure why we've put the fence around there, it's not like he's planning on going anywhere!

Great news. We haven't had many birds some in our doors for a while. Everyone's very excited to meet him! I'm especially intrigued as I've been wanting to care for a Shoebill for quite a while. I've also come up with a name, Eddie!
That enclosure seems a little small. We've picked out a nice roomy habitat for him. We suspect he'll love it! The enclosure is nice, but I do wish we could see his smiling face! Speaking of Eddie, what anomalous properties should we be expecting?

There isn't much you'll need to worry about vis-Ã -vis anomalous traits. My only gripe about him is he doesn't need to eat or sleep (His squawking could get a little loud during the night!). But for the most part, he's just like a baseline shoebill. I've packed a copy of the full documentation we have on him (including some wonderful photos from our on-site amateur photographer that are just so lovely) along with him in the truck we're sending him to you in. Should be arriving any time now!

I think I just heard your trucks pull up! I'll send over his new documents soon!
