### Special Containment Procedures
  
Due to its distance from the Solar System, SCP-7310's discovery by the non-anomalous community is highly improbable. Any discoveries suggesting the existence of SCP-7310 in non-anomalous communities are to be discredited using Cover Story 158 (Cosmic Background Radiation). 
**Update:**  
Through currently unknown methods, SCP-7310 began to penetrate the signal blocker array established on February 1st, 2035.

SCP-7310 as observed from Relay Station Tau
SCP-7310 is a mechanical construct four kilometers in height with a mass of approximately 3.67 x 1016 kilograms that broadcasts radio signals across the Plastic and Milky Way Galaxies. Although SCP-7310 does not resemble any distinctive architectural style found in the Foundation's expanded compendium of interstellar species, SCP-7310 possesses several technomantic sigils typically associated with Fifthism.
SCP-7310 emanates a constant, anomalous auditory pulse that drastically increases dopamine production in carbon-based organisms[1](javascript:;). This effect, while not compulsive, is akin to addiction. Listeners will do everything within their power to "maintain their connection" to SCP-7310, and grow discontented when SCP-7310 cannot be heard.
Subjects report auditory hallucinations, typically assuming the form of a soft-spoken voice with an English accent whispering information not privy to uninvolved parties in close proximity to their ear. These auditory hallucinations can also be heard by recording and adjusting specific audio frequencies typically inaudible to humans. The anomaly currently affects approximately one-in-ten thousand people on Earth. This auditory hallucination is hypothesized to be caused by SCP-7310, although confirmation is pending.
The circumstances that cause SCP-7310 to cease being heard are unknown.
