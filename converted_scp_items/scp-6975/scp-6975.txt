SCP-6975:

 Universal Reset Button

Item No:

 SCP-6975

Containment Class:

 Thaumiel

Special Containment Procedures:

 SCP-6975 is contained in Containment Chamber 08 at Iranian Site-14 and may only be damaged in compliance with the orders of Project Hakam.

SCP-6975-1 instances have been placed throughout all Foundation Sites. Should additional SCP-6975-1 instances be required, 

SCP-1106

 may be used to obtain the base materials.

Description:

 SCP-6975 is the heart of Iranian citizen Ruqayyah Abbas. Should SCP-6975 be damaged to the point of being unable to function, the temporal state of the surrounding area

1

 will be reverted to its state 8 hours prior to the incident. However, only people within 10 metres of SCP-6975 or an SCP-6975-1 instance at the time of the incident will retain memories of the original 8 hours.

SCP-6975-1 instances are excised portions of the flesh of Ruqayyah Abbas, each being 1Â cm

3

 in size and contained in a suitably-sized container of embalming fluid.

Discovery:

 On 1953-08-12, a truck crashed in Kermanshahan Province, Iran, instantly killing several members of the Abbas family and causing Ruqayyah Abbas to succumb to exsanguination over the subsequent 10 minutes.

On 1953-08-12, Site-14 recorded an abnormal temporal anomaly. Staff found SCP-6975 to be the source of the anomaly and Ruqayyah Abbas was subsequently transported to Site-14. The Abbas family were administered Class-C amnestics and were provided a cover story of Ruqayyah having died of a congenital heart condition. A substitute 6-year-old female corpse was provided for burial.

On 1953-09-27, Overseer Command approved the submission of proposals to adapt SCP-6975 for internal Foundation use.

Rejected Proposals:

Proposed By:

 Edgar Santiago, Junior Researcher in Site-14 Temporal Analysis Division

Method:

 To execute Ruqayyah Abbas several times in quick succession to see if there is a limit to the number of times SCP-6975 can reverse time.

Overseer Command:

 

DENIED

 as proposal is unlikely to provide information about temporal anomalies that cannot be more easily obtained from other sources.

Proposed By:

 Charlotte Pennycock, Senior Researcher in Site-14 Memetics and Cognitohazards Division

Method:

 To have Ruqayyah Abbas present when exposing test subjects to suspected cognitohazardous anomalies. Should a cognitohazard be discovered, Ruqayyah Abbas would be executed. This would cause the reversal of time to before initial exposure, allowing confirmation of cognitohazard existence without the loss of test subjects.

Overseer Command:

 

DENIED

 due to the potential exposure of Ruqayyah Abbas to cognitohazards and the unknown relationships between temporal anomalies and cognitohazards.

Proposed By:

 Hugh Kirkwell, Head of Site-14 Advanced Interrogation Division

Method:

 To have Ruqayyah Abbas present during the interrogation of captured enemy agents. After 7 hours, Ruqayyah Abbas would be executed. Interrogations could then be repeated indefinitely, utilising previously-gained information to perfect our methods, allowing the process to be concluded with a greater degree of success and in a shorter timeframe than previously possible.

Overseer Command:

 

DENIED

 due to the high potential for hazardous information to be released during interrogation, causing damage to Ruqayyah Abbas and SCP-6975.

On 1953-10-12, Charles Martin

 submitted Project Hakam to Overseer Command, detailing his proposal to integrate SCP-6975 into the Foundation's defence system. Following preliminary approval, the proposal was transferred to the Ethics Committee for overview. All subsequent moral objections were overruled by Overseer Command.

Project Hakam:

From 1953-10-29 to 1955-08-07, over 100,000 SCP-6975-1 instances were produced from extracted portions of Ruqayyah Abbas' body. These instances were placed throughout all Foundation Sites, ensuring they were fully covered by the memory-preservation effects of the SCP-6975-1 instances.

On 1955-08-30, SCP-6975 was surgically removed from Ruqayyah Abbas and attached to a suitable machine to simulate the human heartbeat. Ruqayyah Abbas' corpse was then incinerated per Foundation biological waste disposal requirements.

As of 1975-07-12, Project Hakam has allowed the Foundation to prevent 19 enemy attacks, 26 containment breaches and the deaths of over 3.9 billion humans.
