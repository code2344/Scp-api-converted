Item #:

 SCP-8485

Object Class:

 Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:

 SCP-8485 is housed in a standard small creature containment chamber at Site-22.

Personnel stationed within 500 meters of SCP-8485's containment chamber are granted headphones, developed to counteract the frequency emitted from SCP-8485. Construction efforts should coincide with periods of increased vocal activity by SCP-8485 whenever possible.

Should SCP-8485's noise levels surpass the pre-recorded standard, personnel are to be temporarily evacuated as to not disrupt active workflow. Medical leave is to be granted if personnel report lasting bouts of tinnitus as to avoid permanent damage to hearing.

Description:

 SCP-8485 is a collective of 293 small globular organisms, comprised entirely of fatty flesh. At the time of discovery, 23% of the SCP-8485 population exhibited some form of injury, ranging from minor scratches to its skin to partial disfigurement.

SCP-8485 is hyperaware at all times, remaining vigilant during movement and observing its immediate surroundings without interruption. SCP-8485 shows aversion to all physical contact. Throughout its containment, SCP-8485 has not yet gone dormant. SCP-8485 continuously vocalizes upwards of 125 decibels to garner human attention.

Addendum SCP-8485-B:

 Physical Check-Up

Following unusual activity and a complete malfunction of the automatic feeder system, a physical check-up was conducted. Remnants of SCP-8485 were spread throughout the chamber, with the containment chamber's walls having been stained a rich purple color. Scratch marks identical to prior observed damage to the feeding system were discovered on the inside of the chamber. A rotten smell perforated throughout the containment unit. Neutralization was presumed; however faint whimpering continued to originate from leftover offal congruent with SCP-8485's anatomy.

Footnotes

1

. Sounds have ranged from baby crying, cooing and in one recorded instance belligerent screaming.

2

. Employee health concerns would be addressed.

3

. Construction crew would suffer permanent hearing loss.

4

. Ethics Committee Intervention.

5

. Background is a recorded temporary blockage of the duct. Minor damage to the metal has been observed.

6

. The issue was able to be fixed remotely through an installed piston to clear anything trapped in the duct. Heavy thump confirmed clearance.

7

. SCP-8485's vocalizations have started to consistently decrease in volume. The spike in volume is attributed to SCP-8485 attempting screaming to garner attention. Behavior is not to be encouraged.
