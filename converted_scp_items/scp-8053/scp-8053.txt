SCP-8053 prior to obtaining anomalous properties.

Item #:

 SCP-8053

Object Class:

 Safe

Special Containment Procedures:

 SCP-8053 is contained in a humanoid containment cell at Site-17. The cell is to be modified to be sound-proof and installed with a digital display timer that synchronizes with the anomaly's activation. The cell is also to be supplied with a collection of literary material, a television set accompanied with a selection of pre-approved films, and several automatic air fresheners. Physical interactions with SCP-8053-A are to be avoided if possible. Personnel are to wear ARC flash suits and insulated gloves prior to physical interaction, should physical interaction be deemed necessary.

As SCP-8053-A possesses a deep-seated dislike of authority figures, SCP-8053-A is to be accompanied by a member of Site-17's D-Class personnel for enrichment purposes. The selected D-Class personnel is encouraged to engage in frequent conversation with SCP-8053-A and follow the requests the entity gives if they are deemed reasonable. Euthanization and/or sedation of SCP-8053-A is to be discontinued due to consistent ineffectiveness.

Description:

 SCP-8053 is an electric chair constructed from wooden material. The object is not only able to operate without being connected to a power source, but is able to withstand all forms of physical damage. SCP-8053's anomalous properties appear to be interconnected with SCP-8053-A.

SCP-8053-A refers to Horrace Fish, a man who was charged with five counts of murder before incarceration and being sentenced to death in 1985.

SCP-8053-A is currently restrained in SCP-8053. Between intervals of five minutes, SCP-8053 will activate, electrocuting SCP-8053-A before briefly turning off. During this process, SCP-8053-A will suffer injuries expected for exposure to high voltages of electricity. Despite this, SCP-8053-A will not expire and all injuries inflicted unto SCP-8053-A will regenerate over the period of a few minutes. SCP-8053's behaviour is constant and autonomous. All attempts to forcibly deactivating SCP-8053 and/or removing SCP-8053-A from the anomaly conducted by the Foundation have failed.

Acquistion:

 On the date of SCP-8053-A's scheduled execution, the prison had run out of supplies to carry out a successful lethal injection. Deciding to still carry out said execution, the prison opted to carry it out via electric chair. However, during the moment of activation, SCP-8053 spontaneously gained its anomalous properties, an event that both the prison staff and attending civilians witnessed.

Upon receiving notification that SCP-8053-A had failed to perish and SCP-8053 continued to activate autonomously, the Foundation intervened. All witnesses were administered Class-B amnestics. SCP-8053 was replaced with an identical model and SCP-8053-A was acquired by the Foundation via standard D-Class Acquisition protocol.

Decline:

 Over multiple years in containment, it has been noted that SCP-8053-A's regenerative properties have declined. Though it is still able to recover from death inflicted by SCP-8053's electrocution, the period of time in which it remains deceased has increased from the original 10 seconds it took in 1985, to 3 minutes as of July 26th, 2015.

The SCP-8053 research team have opted to not inform SCP-8053-A of this information. However, SCP-8053-A appeared to possess knowledge of the fact its deaths were lasting longer during an enrichment interaction with D-Class personnel. See the attached log for further details.

<BEGIN LOG>

[D-1221 enters the containment chamber and waves at SCP-8053-A as he approaches.]

D-1221:

 Hello, Horrace. How are you doing today?

SCP-8053-A:

 How do you think I'm doing?

D-1221:

 Sorry. 

[D-1221 moves to grab a book from the bookshelf on the wall.]

 Did you want to pick up from where we left off last time?

SCP-8053-A:

 No.

D-1221:

 Well, uh. What do you want to do today then? Watch a movie?

SCP-8053-A:

 No. I'm feeling a little sentimental today. Let me tell you a story, son.

D-1221:

 Oh, sure.

SCP-8053-A:

 You know what I did to get the chair?

D-1221:

 No, I don't… but I can't imagine it was anything good.

SCP-8053-A:

 I strangled five women. All of them blondes. All of them young. All of them very pretty.

D-1221:

 I guess you can say you had a type, eh?

SCP-8053-A:

 I sure did. I know what I like, and I like choking the life out of young dumb blondes who look like my ex-wife. What got you into this situation?

D-1221:

 I killed my cat and then my roommate.

SCP-8053-A:

 Goodness, Eddie boy, I didn't know you were also a hard man.

D-1221:

 I'm not particularly proud of what I did. I was—am, mentally ill. I didn't know this until after I was analyzed by a court psychologist. It made so much sense after hearing it from someone smarter than me.

SCP-8053-A:

 Ah, so you're a nut. Heh. I met a few nuts in prison. My lawyer tried saying I was crazy, but the court wasn't buying it. But anyway, as I was saying, I killed five blonde bitches. I would submit my video profile for matchmaker services and get their number, then convince them to meet me in a park with a hiking trail, where I would butter them up and walk with them off the beaten path.

D-1221:

 And then you strangled them?

SCP-8053-A:

 Smart as a whip, aren't you? Yeah. I would dump the bodies off a ravine and leave them there to rot. Everything was going fine until someone found them. I guess it's my fault. I got sloppy.

D-1221:

 Do you regret what you did?

[SCP-8053-A laughs.]

SCP-8053-A:

 Not one bit. I took pleasure in watching their lives go out like a candle in the wind. In fact, I—

[An electric humming sound emanates from SCP-8053. The anomaly activates, electrifying SCP-8053-A. The subject twitches and writhes, screaming in pain.]

D-1221:

 Man, that smell is awful every time. Can you even smell it yourself, or are your nostrils fried?

[D-1221 covers his nose and looks away from SCP-8053-A. There are burn marks all over its body and its flesh is charred. The injuries begin to slowly reverse. SCP-8053-A remains unresponsive.]

D-1221:

 Horrace?

[Silence.]

D-1221:

 Horrace? Hello? 

[D-1221 waves his hand in front of SCP-8053-A's face.]

[SCP-8053-A jolts to life, gasping and staring up at D-1221.]

SCP-8053-A:

 Fuck!

[D-1221 jumps back a few paces, nearly falling over.]

D-1221:

 Shit! You scared the hell out of me, man! What took you so long to come to?

SCP-8053-A:

 What else? This rickety thing gets worse by the year. The shocks. The healing. In-between. 

Everything!

 The lab coats say it's nothing unusual but it's easy to say that from that side of the fucking screen! 

[SCP-8053-A shouts in the direction of the two-view mirror. After growling, SCP-8053-A visibly calms.]

 Ain't it?

D-1221:

 What do you mean?

SCP-8053-A:

 I've started to die. It was bound to happen. This all began, what, 30 years ago? The fact I've made it this long without dying for good is a miracle. But every time I die, I die for a little longer.

D-1221:

 That sounds terrifying.

SCP-8053-A:

 Want to know the real scary part?

D-1221:

 What?

SCP-8053-A:

 There's nothing after.

D-1221:

 What do you mean?

SCP-8053-A:

 There's nothing waiting for me at the other side. An eternity of nothing. It's not even darkness. Just nothing.

[D-1221 fidgets.]

SCP-8053-A:

 When I was a boy, my mom told me that if I didn't behave and do right by God, I would go to hell. But she always told me that hell would be fire and brimstone. This ain't that.

D-1221:

 I—

SCP-8053-A:

 Sorry.

D-1221:

 No, it's fine, I just… don't know what to say.

SCP-8053-A:

 In a way, I guess I've earned it.

D-1221:

 How do you mean?

SCP-8053-A:

 Well, let me ask you something, Eddie. Do you feel like you earned your punishment for doing what you did?

D-1221:

 Well… I regret what I did.

SCP-8053-A:

 That's not what I'm asking, son.

[D-1221 remains silent a moment.]

D-1221:

 Yes.

SCP-8053-A:

 Right then. I don't regret what I did. But I know it was bad. And I know that when you do bad, you get punished. I deserve this. It's only fair.

D-1221:

 I don't think anyone deserves to be electrocuted, killed, and be brought back to life for 30 years.

SCP-8053-A:

 And here I was thinking you were a hard man, Eddie.

D-1221:

 Horrace, that's torture. I don't think anyone deserves to be tortured.

SCP-8053-A:

 Well, I think I do. The world could use less sick fucks like me.

D-1221:

 I think you've atoned by now, don't you?

SCP-8053-A:

 Heh.

[Researcher Simone enters the room. She looks to D-1221 and then to SCP-8053-A, then motions for the former to follow her.]

Researcher Simone:

 Come. We have need of you elsewhere. You'll get to wrap this up later.

D-1221:

 But I—

SCP-8053-A:

 Go with her, Eddie boy. I don't need these lab coat's pity parties. Nothing against you, son. But I know that you lab coats were keeping something from me, and now that I know what it is, I'm not gonna play ball with these prisoners you bring in to keep me company. Stop bringing them in.

Researcher Simone:

 Are you sure, Mr. Fish? We find that mental stimulation is helpful for humans in conta—

SCP-8053-A:

 Yes, I'm sure. Fuck off and leave an old man to die.

Researcher Simone:

 Very well. D-1221, please follow me.

D-1221:

 I… okay.

[D-1221 and Researcher Simone exit the containment chamber.]

[SCP-8053-A is alone in the chamber. After a short period of time, SCP-8053-A begins to quietly hyperventilate. A tear stream emerges from its right eye. An electric hum is heard.]

SCP-8053-A:

 Bring it.
