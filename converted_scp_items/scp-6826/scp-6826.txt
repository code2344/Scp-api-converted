Item #:

 SCP-6826

Object Class:

 Euclid

Colloquial Designation:

 Apologetic Carrier

Special Containment Procedures:

 SCP-6826 resides in the water feature within its enclosure. Water feeding the feature must be continuously agitated and kept separate from main supplies and drains. In the event of contamination, persons infected by 6826-A (6826-B) may be offered to the object to discourage its escape. Samples of 6826-A should be stored separately unless being used to retrieve the object.

Confirmation of the presence of SCP-6826 within its enclosure is required weekly. If apparent absence of object persists, food rewards such as churros, shelled pecans, yellow passion fruit, or the heads of sheep or goats may draw it out, so as to enable detection by perimeter cameras. (Heads must be skinned and horns removed.) Additional nutrients are to be added to object’s water if it becomes lethargic, adverse to scheduled activities, or otherwise exhibits excessive fasting.

No standing water or reflective material exceeding 10 centimeters in diameter is permitted within the object’s enclosure. It should be noted that items and surfaces capable of holding a surface of standing water in excess of 10 centimeters are also prohibited.

Oblong mirrors not exceeding 6 centimeters in length are to be hung on the exterior of the perimeter fence, at 0.5 meter intervals, facing inward. Items of this type may also be provided the object in exchange for compliant behavior or if object sustains injury.

As no additional instances of 6826-C are required at this time, eye protection is to be worn by all personnel working in or directly outside the perimeter fence, and with the object itself, with special attention payed to those attempting to collect blood samples or administer drugs to the object. Dr. Kyle Sands is to remain employed and retain their original status. They are to receive concealing lenses and wear them during all civilian contact.

Description:

 SCP-6826 is a white/gray 2.1 to 3 meter hairless biped with non-cloven hooves and digitigrade legs. Its weight ranges from 95.5 to 80 kilograms. Object possesses a humanoid torso that appears to have its arms bound by ropes or tree roots. These can unravel into branched appendages. Object possesses a long, flexible neck that contributes to its perceived height. Its head is bony with a prominent muzzle. Object produces vocalizations described as low creaks.

Object’s eyes appear to be composed of droplets of dark liquid, that can be pulled back into the sockets making them appear to be empty. Eyes may burst if it becomes agitated, spraying bystanders with a clear liquid with similar effects to capsaicin. Eyes regenerate immediately after these incidents.

Object is able to travel in and out of apparent reality by using still water or other reflective flat or curved surfaces as gateways. Due to object’s noted constriction abilities, surfaces exceeding 10 centimeters in diameter are to be considered potential candidates. Non-aquatic surfaces such as mirrors, window glass, polished metal sheeting or pools of other liquids appear to be exits only.

Object is able to cause nearby items reflecting it to break or tarnish, this causes injuries to the object to reverse with anomalous speed. Items used for regeneration have included the human eye. (see recovery)

SCP-6826-A

Object is able to disappear completely into artificial water features with a known volume of at least 10,000 liters. Water from these features may become contaminated with 6826-A. 6826-A is a spirochete bacteria that may cause disease in persons who drink or bathe in water it inhabits. While related to other known forms of spirochaete, 6826-A is unobserved outside of association with the object. Contact with the object itself rather than its water seems insufficient to spread 6826-A but should be accompanied by standard hygienic procedures.

6826-A symptoms resemble an acute form of Lyme disease or leptospirosis. 6826-A may incapacitate infected human subjects but has only a mild effect on other primates. Aquatic surfaces used by the object for travel are less likely to contain 6826-A than inhabited features, but are to be considered contaminated for precautionary reasons. 6826-A is responsive to antibiotics and appears to be non-anomalous.

Object is able to locate persons infected with 6826-A (6826-B) by unknown means and employ its branched appendages to remove and replace blood from the subject with its own. (If subject resists, object may immobilize it by “eye- bursting”.)This results in complete recovery in 80% of subjects, with others requiring additional medical intervention due to infections involving one or more injection sites. Due to low number of known subjects, few fatalities are observed. Immunity to 6826-A, several forms of relapsing fever - and possibly other spirochete pathogens, is conferred. Affected persons are non-anomalous, but may retain psychological trauma.

Object’s blood displays the human blood type O-negative, and registers as a distant relation to Dr. Kyle Sands, weather this is due to genetic connection or to occasional assimilation of human cells is unknown.

Sands claims object was brought to the North American continent in the 18th century by relatives on their mother’s side. This is unconfirmed.

Discovery:

 This file has received updates following the investigation and successful containment of SCP-6826 through extensive contributions from Dr. Kyle Sands and General Intern Samiya Starr. Prior procedures involved only the suppression of infrequent incidents, involving a rare infection occurring in the US. city of San Antonio followed by the appearance of bipedal entity.

Only three incidents having occurred in a period of 30 years, object was given low priority. The latest incident was filmed by security camera on June 4, 2018

Confiscated security footage from ████████ █████ ████ Hospital indicates a tall, unsteady entity shoving aside intervening persons or incapacitating them by “eye-bursting” in order reach what was reported to be a specific patient it then “attacked” off camera. The entity disappeared before recovery could be attempted. ███████ ██████ the patient in question, survived the attack and recovered with no long term damage or anomalous effects, perceiving the experience to have been “a nightmare.” Amnestic’s were administered to other witnesses.

Discovery of the S-Method

Incident A

Date:

 April 1, 2019

Location:

 Site 62, building 7

Blood samples from the last targeted patient were recovered and a potential causative agent was isolated. Stored samples of spirochaete were stacked together on a table by General Intern Samiya Starr at 0400 Hours (4:00 AM).

Building 7 was closed and officially locked. Stock maintenance was scheduled for the 2nd. (Starr felt their superiors were “messing with them” but felt the need to follow directives. They unlocked a staff entrance with a custodian’s key previously assigned to them.)

At 2000 hours (8:00 PM), SCP-6826 is recorded by security cameras. It appears to be attracted by the sounds of Starr working in the north corner labs. Despite the absence of cameras in building 7 restrooms, it can nonetheless be assumed that the object entered the building by that means. Starr hears the object and investigates.

A toilet seat entangled in the object’s neck and the significance of the date lead Starr to assume it is a docile object, released as a prank. (Starr had not been given the full file on SCP-6826 and did not initially recognize it.) Object pushes past Starr and attacks the stocks of 6826-A. Vials are pushed on to the floor and broken with the object’s hooves. A powerful acid is regurgitated on to the stocks.

Calls for assistance are logged. As person involved is assumed to be the victim of a prank, incident is not prioritized. Dr. Kyle Sands responds immediately when informed.

(Sands requested the task of maintaining the stocks, they were were deemed overqualified and the task was assigned to technicians.)

Starr succeeds in trapping the object in the ground-level break room due to its interest in a plate of churros. Object consumes the churros and pushes an open water bottle on the tile floor, sinking into the resulting pool. Sands arrives after recorded escape of object.

This incident identified the causative agent of 6826-A and proved it could be, in sufficient quantities, used to produce SCP-6826.

Sands and Starr receive reprimand for entering a lab on standby.

 

Personal Memo

 

FROM:

 Dr. Kyle Sands

To:

 SCP-6826 testing directors.

DATE:

 April 3, 2019

 

I apologize that there is simply no way I can currently prove that the object is what Gaspar de San Buenaventura brought with him when he traveled to New Spain with Antonio de Olivares.

 

All I know is a story my grandmother would tell where Gaspar buried an egg-shaped reliquary containing the ashes of an unknown saint beneath an irrigation canal - the, Acequia Madre de Valero. The relic was supposed to give the water healing effects but it seemed to cause an “aching, red-eyed fever” that crippled local farmers and nearly led to a famine.

 

Gaspar tried to remove the relic but found it was in pieces. A “Bound Goose Woman” was reported by the farmers, said to appear in dreams but having a very real presence. I know we can retrieve SCP-6826, not just summon and dismiss it. I need the resources to contain this thing or people could get sick again.

 

I think we all need to pay attention to the implications here,

 

Kyle

Experiment Logs

Initial attempts to produce and study SCP-6826 using the S-method were not strictly concerned with containment of a singular, physical object. 6826-A being a non-anomalous controllable pathogen, it was of lesser concern than its primary object. Focus on SCP-6826’s teleportation abilities and interactions with reflective surfaces was prioritized.

 

+ Test A of the S-Method 

Access Granted 

Test A of the S-Method, April 17, 1400 Hours (2:00 PM). 2019

6 standard storage vials of 6826-A at standard ppm were placed on a platform in a locked, lighted, square room with floor space of 200 square meters and ceiling height of 3.5 meters, at site 38. 30 centimeters of stagnant tap water covered the floor. SCP-6826 appeared 12 Hours after assembly of vials.

Object rose slowly from the water and walked across the surface with out causing agitation. (Water responded as though comprising a solid surface.)

Object lifted vial-set by handle with its mouth, and slowly descended into the water. No agitation was observed during its arrival and departure.

It was concluded earlier samples of 6826-A were destroyed in situ due to them being too difficult for object to carry collectively into its “way.”

 

+ Test B of the S-Method 

Access Granted 

Test B of the S-Method, April 18, 1000 Hours (10:00 AM). 2019

Repeat of test A, with agitators to be turned on as object traversed toward vial-set. Note that object arrived 8 hours after assembly of vials. This was later attributed to increasing experience with a particular traveled route.

SCP-6826 sank into agitated water, slipping and falling. Object’s head connected with the edge of the platform, producing a bleeding injury to the left side of its face. Object lay stunned for several minutes.

Object was able to stagger upright and push past attendants when the room was opened. Intern Samiya Starr reports their glasses cracking when eye contact was made with SCP-6826. The wound on its face was observed to rapidly heal at this point in the footage.

Object tripped over an office chair 12 seconds after breach appearing to injure its leg (Evidenced by its limping). 8 seconds later, it was able to enter a staff restroom. One of two, large mirrors cracked spontaneously, the other being used by the object to escape in the manner of previous egress through water.

It was concluded that SCP-6826 is able substitute injury to itself with injury to items that hold its reflection. Though the object is able use stagnant water to enter or exit apparent reality, it can use non-aquatic surfaces as exits.

Noting object’s prior use of a toilet to access 6826-A samples despite the restrooms in site 62 building 7 including large mirrors lends credence to the assumption that non-aquatic surfaces are exclusively exits.

 

Tests C and D

 resulted in lack of response from the object. Proposal to employ infected D-class as lure, was postponed due to a momentary shortage of subjects. Reports of a swan-like “cryptid”

via civilian sources indicated SCP-6826 was a single object using reflective “gates” to travel to test sites from a fixed point in apparent reality. Objective shifted to capture and containment in the field.

Retrieval

The San Antonio area being the source of prior cases is assigned to Dr. Sands and General Intern Samiya Starr, upon recommendation by Sands, citing a theory that 6826-A is water-born and that locating a natural source could lead directly to to the location of SCP-6826. Samples collected are initially inconclusive.

Area waterways are then searched in effort to locate the object itself. Searches are conducted at night to minimize civilian interaction. Shatter-proof vials containing 6826-A cultures are placed in backpacks worn by Sands and Star. The application of churros is presumed but unverified.

Object is sighted at 0100 Hours, (1:AM) on May 23, 2019. It is pursued down a narrow stairway, maintaining its balance despite an unsteady gait. Sands radioes for assistance.

Starr prevents the object’s escape when it approaches a deactivated water feature by confronting it from the opposite side. This necessitated wading into the feature. Starr is subject to object’s “eye-burst” defense but wears a face shield.

Object is given a sedative by Sands and lowers itself into a sitting position. It is fitted with a restriction harness and a tarp is used conceal it from civilian witnesses. Sands experiences extensive damage to his left eye, while wrapping the object. Object is reported to be unconscious at the time of the incident.

1:15 AM, assistance arrives.

Sands is transported for evaluation and treatment. Starr is ordered to remain with the object and provided with additional personnel. Object described as “fully conscious” by assisting personnel.

Object is raised to street level with the use of bridge-mounted equipment. Procedure attracts civilian attention which is suppressed with claims the object’s exposed legs belong to “a small, white horse, being rescued after sustaining injuries”.

Tarp is removed from object as it is loaded into a van previously fitted with textured walls, barred, tinted windows, and absorbent livestock bedding to exclude the pooling of liquids. During transport, object removes a section of rubber matting lining the floor of the van, and places it over a hole in the bedding to create a sufficient depression. It then presumably waits for the van to cease movement and regurgitates a clear, non-foaming, gastric acid on to the matting by which it escapes.

May 26, Starr develops symptoms of 6826-A, claims to have contracted it from the deactivated water feature. Admits to deliberately drinking a sample of water from the feature when their honesty is called into question. Cited purpose was proving feature’s water contained 6826-A.

Water from the retrieval site is transferred to a pre-existing feature at site 62 after additional tests confirm the presence of 6826-A. Original feature is sterilized. Starr’s infection is maintained and employed to successfully produce SCP-6826 from the transported water. Object was no longer fitted with a restriction harness.

Dr. Sands’ left eye was found to be absent. An eye identical to that of SCP-6826 grew to fill the socket within 3 hours. Eye burst when Sands became agitated, it returned within 0.3 seconds. Fluid from the eye was found to have similar effects to capsaicin on bystanders. Eye described by Sands as “painless.” Eye perceives color but exhibits light sensitivity. Sands prescribed custom contacts for civilian interactions. Allowed to continue employment under the designation 6826-C.

Date:

 May 28, 2019

Location:

 SCP-6826 (offices adjoining object enclosure)

Interviewer:

 Dr. Harold Starr

Interviewed:

 General Intern Samiya Starr

Description:

 Starr is currently being treated with the assistance of SCP-6826. It is sitting next to them. As Starr is familiar with the object, they are calm. Starr is delirious due to affects of 6826-A, and drugs used to counter its symptoms.

Harold:

 Care to explain what the hell you just did?

Samiya:

 All in the line of duty, Captain!

Harold:

 Your 

duty

 was not to infect yourself with an unknown disease.

Samiya:

 

Our

 duty is to protect people, right? Kyle said the object was spreading 6826-A. (Looks at SCP-6826) No offense dude.

(Object emits a single, low creak)

Harold:

 6826-A by itself could not have fractured reality. And neither could our friend here, granted it had remained hidden.

Samiya:

 Since when does the Foundation 

not

 want to S-C-P a thing?

Harold:

 If you only knew what far greater concerns threatened our world at this moment.

Samiya:

 Concerns greater then keeping 6826-A out of a city’s water supply? How could Wobbly have possibly fixed hundreds of people in time if a flood washed its water into the river?

Harold:

 You named it?

Samiya:

 I get tired of saying SCP-6826 all the time.

Harold:

 (takes notes) If a flood had washed 6826-A into the San-Antonio River, it may not have had an effect at such high dilutions and a flood is unlikely, the engineering of the river is notable. Though if an epidemic of some kind had occurred then it would have simply been an epidemic. Epidemics are natural, normal. Normal, I’m afraid, is not in your job description.

Samiya:

 But I watched the stuff grow in fresh river water, it doesn’t have to be in vivo. I restored the stocks in fifteen hours! Kyle says it’s a time bomb!

Harold:

 But you were feeding it, weren’t you, and it had no competition in a sterile environment. Note that Kyle specializes in low-level bio-contagions and will - like anyone who values their payed profession - overestimate its importance.

Samiya:

 But what if some drunk played in the fountain?

Harold:

 That would be the job of municipal ordinance. 6826-A is not anomalous. Only the object is anomalous. Infections were rare and the object’s appearances were rare, many believe they had dreamed it. Now resources must be redirected to a low-level threat because the two of you had to put on a show.

Samiya:

 Resources? You mean to say Kyle and I had to ignore a catastrophe waiting to happen because money? Is an object less important just cause a little guy points it out?

Harold:

 Need I remind you, 6826-A is treatable.

Samiya:

 Yeah, but not everyone’s got insurance.

Harold:

 Don’t believe everything you read on the internet. I suggest you turn off your phone and get some rest.

(Harold reaches for Samiya’s standard-issue, closed-circuit pocket communicator. SCP-6826 emits a series of high-pitched clicks and snaps at their hand. Harold pulls away.)

Harold:

 (to object) You can only ever solve problems you cause, can’t you?

Description:

Harold:

 What’s with the book?

Kyle:

 It belonged to Gaspar de San Buenaventura. Don’t touch it without gloves, it’s very old.

Harold:

 I can’t read Spanish.

Kyle:

 (turning the pages) It has pictures.

Harold:

 Is that SCP-6826?

Kyle:

 What else would it be?

Harold:

 If this is the proof you wanted to bring us about the identity of the object then I’m going to have to confiscate it.

Kyle:

 But I promised my grandmother …

Harold:

 You only have to give us the book if you’re wishing to submit it as evidence in your favor. If you can prove you had prior knowledge of the object, and were acting on that knowledge, then perhaps a promotion would be in order.

Kyle:

 And Samiya?

Harold:

 What about her?

Kyle:

 Would she get promoted too?

Harold:

 I can’t promote my own daughter that would be nepotism.

Kyle:

 Technically, nepotism refers to promoting your nephew.

Harold:

 Are you giving us the book or not?

Kyle:

 I know I won’t get it back if I do.

Harold:

 Then why are you showing it to me?

Kyle:

 So that you at least, can take this seriously. My relative brought something to Texas two centuries ago that was supposed to help people, but it did the opposite. He wasn’t able to recapture it, but we did.

Harold:

 So it’s done then, you got what you wanted. SCP-6826 is in its enclosure, we’ve added it to future budget projections, some of the new people find it very interesting and you can call yourself an acquisitions agent, at least unofficially. So, why the book?

Kyle:

 It describes what might of happened had we not acted, you’ve heard of the plagues affecting local populations in colonial days? The object is the only one of its kind known to be living in this area, it would not have been able to reach everyone in time.

Harold:

 Should I remind you modern medicine exists and that it’s not our job to save people from more or less normal threats?

Kyle:

 Just how many more or less normal threats are out there now?

Harold:

 Is this blackmail? You don’t have that clearance!

(Harold makes a sudden attempt to retrieve the book and triggers Kyle’s left eye.)

Harold:

 Son of a Bitch! (Harold sits in the corner and guards his face.)

Kyle:

 You may need to get yourself checked, I’m still not sure that I can’t spread 6826-A that way. Oh and, could you return my contact lens?

Harold:

 Where is it?

Kyle:

 On your shirt collar.
