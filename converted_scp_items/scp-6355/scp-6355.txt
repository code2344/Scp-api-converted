We know how to find you.

Threat Level:

 Yellow

SCP-6355 (bottom center-right.)

Special Containment Procedures:

 Per its contract, SCP-6355 is entitled to an annual wage of £25.000 before taxes. It is further entitled to a personalized healthcare package, tailored to its unique physiology and exclusively to be employed at Foundation clinics.

SCP-6355's containment cell has been moved to the edge of the GBENWM-Site-02 Containment Wing, and is retrofitted with the amenities appropriate for an employee of its station. Twice per day, SCP-6355 is permitted to occupy the body of a coworker as they take their meals; to this end, at least three employees of the Fire Suppression Department must be on kosher meal plans at any one time.

Further benefits have been provided to SCP-6355:

SCP-6355 may make purchase requests, either for its cell, its media library, or as gifts.

On Friday nights, SCP-6355 is permitted to occupy the body of brain-dead personnel to attend worship services.

Once per month, SCP-6355 is permitted to travel to a city within 200 km, provided it occupies a member of, and allows itself to be escorted by, Mobile Task Force Sigma-25 ("Ghostbusters") reserve personnel.

SCP-6355's use of its anomalous abilities in the process of work will not be counted as breaches of containment.

Should SCP-6355 leave its position with the Fire Suppression Department, see Document 6355-Q for secondary containment procedures.

Description:

 SCP-6355 is an abnormal instance of Spectral Entity Of Interest-040 ("Mazzikim"), i.e. an invisible, non-sentient spirit associated with deleterious spectral activity. Unlike baseline instances, SCP-6355 is uniquely sapient and self-directed, irrespective of background Malakhic Radiation.

SCP-6355 identifies itself as a remnant of "Avigail", a Jewish resident of late 12th-century York. Previously, SCP-6355 resided within Beth Ahm Yisrael, a Conservative Jewish synagogue

1

.

SCP-6355 is capable of inducing physical, mental, and spiritual distress upon sapient subjects. This form of malicious behavior is typical of Mazzikim; however, SCP-6355's sapience allows it far greater control over its ministrations.

At present, SCP-6355 is employed with the Fire Suppression Department.

ENCOUNTER-6355-A

DATE:

 24/01/2000

SUBJECT:

 SCP-6355

[BEGIN LOG]

MTF-Σ25 and Researcher Cunningham enter Site-6355-A through the north synagogue entryway. The group proceed down the nave, and begin setting up their equipment in the chancel.

Footage begins to distort. MTF-Σ25-01 through MTF-Σ25-04 slow their work, and become fixated on their own bodies. Gradually, all MTF members begin frantically brushing, waving, and scratching at their uniforms. Researcher Cunningham only stares at their hand.

Command:

 Report. Captain, 

report

.

MTF-Σ25-01|Watts:

 Bugs. There are- 

(static, frantic scratching over coms)

 bugs in our suits, Command!

Command:

 Ground yourself, Captain. Feed shows no "bugs" anywhere. Listen to me, you're perfectly-

Feed is interrupted by static. Once re-established, feed shows MTF-Σ25 and Researcher Cunningham covered in welts, blisters, and dark bruises. MTF-Σ25-03 begins to shake.

Researcher Cunningham:

 Fascinating.

MTF-Σ25-01|Watts:

 Command, equipment says this is an SEI Mazzikin. We should 

not

 be here without a ritual chalice…

Command:

 Negative, Captain. A Mazzikin would have immediately-

Unknown Voice:

 

(From all directions)

 HERETICS. BUTCHERS. SUFFER AS I HAVE SUFFERED. FLEE IN THE MERCY I WAS NEVER SHOWN.

MTF-Σ25-01|Watts:

 Command, subject is 

sentient

. Repeat, this is a 

sentient Mazzikin

. We're retreating. Move out - I said move out, now!

MTF-Σ25 and Researcher Cunningham quickly evacuate Site-6355-A. Cunningham pauses briefly in the main atrium, looking back. The figure of a young girl is seen hovering over the Altar.

Researcher Cunningham:

 Yes. I think this will do.

[END LOG]

ADDENDUM-6355-001

Following this interaction, Researcher Cunningham drafted a project proposal to the Fire Suppression Department to communicate, and headhunt SCP-6355.

This proposal was accepted, pending SCP-6355's compliance.

INTERVIEW-6355-A

DATE:

 27/01/2000

SUBJECT:

 SCP-6355

[BEGIN LOG]

Video begins. The blood of a properly slaughtered sheep is poured into a silver chalice, and a Malakhic Entity is called to occupy it. Shortly thereafter, a drop of pig's blood is mixed into the chalice, rendering it ritually unclean; the resulting Akiva vacuum forces SCP-6355 to occupy its place.

SCP-6355:

 You insult me.

Cunningham:

 I'm sorry, Avigail. Truly. We had to ensure our own safety.

SCP-6355:

 Ridiculous notion. There's terror to be had. G-d willing, there's terror to be had.

Cunningham:

 You don't think you've spread enough already, Avigail?

SCP-6355:

 I don't. You don't talk quite like them. Your skin's darker. Bet they did to your kind what they did to me. Still, you're with them. You'd set fire to the tower all the same.

Researcher Cunningham nods, remaining silent for several seconds while they write something in their notebook.

Cunningham:

 

(…)

 So, how does it make you feel?

SCP-6355:

 Don't feel anything. Burnt off.

Cunningham:

 Not literally, Avigail. When you terrorize a human, be it sickness, madness… any kind of mortal terror, what goes on in your mind? You 

do

 have a mind, no?

SCP-6355:

 I.

SCP-6355 pauses, and remains inert for several seconds.

SCP-6355:

 Good. Feels good. Feels right. "

Hashem yikkom damam

", I believe they call it.

Cunningham:

 Excellent.

Researcher Cunningham nods, and jots something into their notebook.

Cunningham:

 So, what if I told you that your terror isn't as much of a problem as the last two weeks might have lead you to believe?

SCP-6355's vessel rattles.

SCP-6355:

 Should've known. Should've known. They were lambs. You want this too.

Cunningham:

 I suppose I do, Avigail; If you'll oblige.

SCP-6355 remains inert for several seconds.

SCP-6355:

 Tell me what.

SCP-6355:

 My body.

Cunningham:

 Hm? What about it, Avigail?

SCP-6355:

 I want my body. A body. Out. I want my body, and I want to leave. You promised.

Cunningham:

 I assure you, we're working on it. Truly. Please, be patient.

SCP-6355:

 Liar. False witness. Traitor. Bearing the weight of 

your

 sins. Have decency, Cunningham.

Cunningham:

 Do 

you

 feel guilty, Avigail?

SCP-6355:

 It weighs on me. I don't have a body. 173 bones in 

your

 body, 

you

 can stand up. I 

have no bones

, Cunningham. I feel every sin.

Cunningham:

 You've performed admirably, Avigail. I don't see why—

SCP-6355:

 Spineless fucking coward!

Video footage begins to distort.

SCP-6355:

 Have you cried for the Temple? Have you mourned the countless dead? Have you begged 

anyone

 to forgive you? How I'd love to be able to drop to hands and knees, beg forgiveness for the excess vengeance I've extracted on 

your

 part! Give me this! Let it not be in vain!

Video footage is consumed by static, before gradually returning to normal. Both remain silent in the interim. Site Director Cunningham clears their throat.

Cunningham:

 This is very upsetting behavior, 6355. You've been an exemplary asset to this department up until now, and I think we continue to do good work. Truly. Now, are you going to comply?

 No.

Site Director Cunningham nods.

 is poured into a silver chalice, and a Malakhic Entity is called to occupy it. Shortly thereafter, a drop of pig's blood is mixed into the chalice, rendering it ritually unclean; the resulting Akiva vacuum forces SCP-6355 to occupy its place.

Cunningham:

 Hello, SCP-6355.

SCP-6355 remains inert for several seconds.

SCP-6355:

 Hi.

Cunningham:

 How's work?

SCP-6355 remains inert for several seconds.

SCP-6355:

 Fine.

Cunningham:

 That's good to hear, 6355. Truly.

Controller Cunningham looks down at their papers, righting them, then continues.

Cunningham:

 Congratulations on your 80th year with the Fire Suppression Department. You've done some excellent work. Truly. Now, we've been-

SCP-6355:

 Can I stop?

Cunningham:

 Working on- Hm?

SCP-6355:

 Can I just… stop? I'm ancient, not stupid. This isn't efficient, or rational, or right with Him. I know I'm never getting my body back, so… how much longer do I have to do this? When can I stop?

Both remain silent for several seconds.

Cunningham:

 We've been working on a new slate of tasks for you, 6355. You'll find your instructions in the usual-

SCP-6355:

 I don't want to do this anymore. I want to stop.

The Controller pauses, aligning a pencil on their desk.

Cunningham:

 So you'd like to go back into the fire, then.

SCP-6355:

 No. No.

Cunningham:

 Do you want to go back into the fire?

SCP-6355:

 No. No, I—

Cunningham:

 Because if you don't want to work anymore, 6355, I'll have to send you back into the fire. Is that what you want?

SCP-6355 is inert for a moment, then begins shaking. Spectral dimensions reduce 28.6%. A soft moaning, and quiet sobbing persists for two minutes. The Controller organizes their stack of files.

Cunningham:

 Are you ready to get back to work, 6355?

SCP-6355:

 

(quietly, while sobbing)

 Bring me back to the tower… give me to Sheol…

Cunningham:

 Answer me, 6355. Are you ready to 

get back to work

?

3 seconds of silence.

SCP-6355:

 Y-… yes. I am.

Cunningham:

 Good. I'm very glad to hear that.

Controller Cunningham reaches over, and places a green stamp on the corner of the topmost document.

Cunningham:

 Truly.
