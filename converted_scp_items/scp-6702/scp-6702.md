**Item #:** SCP-6702
**Object Class:** Neutralized
**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-6702 has neutralized itself. This document is kept as a record and backup. No further containment is required.
**Description:** SCP-6702 is a lake. Constant moderate rain falls on the area covered by the lake; however, the water level of the lake does not rise as a result as would be expected.
When a human subject enters SCP-6702, an optical phenomenon will appear within the rain, mostly forming a clear image. These images can be captured by photographic devices. The existence of the events depicted in these images, as well as the links to the experimental subject, are currently being researched.
