> **Ticket:** #58KG4VO  
>  **Date Filed:** 10 NOV 2058  
>  **Importance:** Low  
>  **Subject:** SCP-7684 Display Error  
>  **Content:**
>> While reviewing AIC-generated analyses, a redirect to the main SCP-7684 file threw up some errors (not redactions). Can somebody clear this up? Not urgent from my perspective, but it might be for people on the containment team. I'd appreciate a heads up when resolved so I can finish my review.
> **Response:**
>> The SCP-7684 page is functioning as intended, but your operational requirement is insufficient to view it. Please consult your security representative.
> **Ticket Status:** CLOSED
> **Ticket:** #O5981A2  
>  **Date Filed:** 15 NOV 2058  
>  **Importance:** Medium  
>  **Subject:** SCP-7684 Page Not Pulling from PAGEANT  
>  **Content:**
>> The main SCP-7684 file continues displaying 'OP-REQ INSUFFICIENT' when viewed from any terminal. I consulted my DSEC, and she claims I am good to see scrubbed summaries of everything mainline. Can you confirm that accesses are being validated in PAGEANT? Others on my team had the same issue when double checking.
> **Response:**
>> PAGEANT is not certified for processing SCP-7684 accesses. Please consult your security representative to identify proper channels.
> **Ticket Status:** CLOSED
> **Ticket:** #9UU351K  
>  **Date Filed:** 03 DEC 2058  
>  **Importance:** Medium  
>  **Subject:** SCP-7684 Page Not Pulling from PAGEANT - V2  
>  **Content:**
>> Refer to ticket #O5981A2 for context. My security representative cannot identify the correct system for validating SCP-7684 access. Can you direct me to the proper system/point of contact/etc.? This is getting a little silly even for this place.
> **Response:**
>> This tool is not certified to handle that information. Please consult your security representative.

>> Ms. Brook,
>> I have been assigned to help resolve your ongoing issue without additional tickets being added to our system. I see that you are having issues accessing the SCP-7684 database entry. Have you confirmed that you are cleared to view it? There are no issues on our end.

>> Thank you for finally reaching out. The help system feels like talking to a brick wall (and closing tickets doesn't help either).
>> I _cannot_ verify access until someone tells me what system to use. It isn't PAGEANT apparently, and it doesn't seem to be the TELTAK either based on shouting from my DSEC's office. Can you just tell me where to check so we can stop bothering you?
>> Respectfully yours,

>> Ms. Brook,
>> Unfortunately, you do not appear to be cleared for any systems that may/may not be capable of validating access to SCP-7684 information, including compartment name and associated personnel. Please have your DSEC contact the RISC office that oversees your portfolio before taking further action.

>> Ms. Brook,
>> Unfortunately, the RAISA help desk is unable to act as an intermediary in any security matters that do not directly involve our storage systems. This appears to be a transit conflict.

>> This is _unfortunately_ getting ridiculous considering how many programs our office is read into. What if somebody's life was at risk? The Deputy Assistant Director will be submitting a document request so we can complete these analyses without any extra nonsense. Which subsection of the Foundation Authority Registry is this handled under? And what is the tracking number for the original directive to classify SCP-7684 at this level?

>> Ms. Brook,
>> Regrettably, information on the original classification determination, subsequent reviews, and related authorities is classified within the same compartment as the SCP-7684 database entry. I do understand this is frustrating. Once you are cleared for access, I will be happy to send more detailed instructions on submitting access requests.
