“Dado”
Archived Containment Procedures:  
METATRON.aic is to review videos uploaded to YouTube or other social media sites for the presence of SCP-6780. Videos containing SCP-6780 are to be taken down and stripped of the anomaly. The channel owners are to be amnesticized.
Copies of SCP-6780 instances are to be stored at the High-Yield Data Storage Facility 1 at Site-43.
**Description:** SCP-6780 is a series of videos and written advertisements produced by GOI-5889 ("**[Vikander-Kneed Technical Media](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/vikander-kneed-technical-media-hub)** ") that represents a public relations advertising campaign for a line of supplements known as _'helth by dado'_. The verbal and audio-visual content of SCP-6780 appears to be attempting to extol the virtues of 'helth by dado' through use of spoken and written testimonials, reenactments, and use of devices such as medical diagrams, which often do not display human anatomy.
'helth by dado', [despite the apparent origin](/dado-hub), is largely non-anomalous in content; examples of products in this line include coyerroodlquhhylx[1](javascript:;) and dado brain plus[2](javascript:;). SCP-6780 instances often portray the products causing significant mundane physical changes in the subject.
Individuals who view SCP-6780 become skeptical of testimonial endorsements concerning a product,[3](javascript:;) even products not featured in SCP-6780. This compels subjects to research products recommended to them, ultimately showing a preference for generic products over well-known brand names.
Video instances of SCP-6780 typically involve testimonials of one kind or another, but can vary with unpredictable regularity. Additionally, demonstrations of the product often end with undesirable results.
**Discovery** : On 11/12/2021, METATRON.aic noted activity triggering several flags for Vikander-Kneed activity on numerous YouTube channels. Review of the noted channels revealed instances of SCP-6780 edited into videos uploaded. Upon confirmation of the GOI’s involvement, members of MTF-Kappa-43 (“The Mediators”) contacted the uploaders, who were unaware of the inclusion of the instances.[4](javascript:;) The videos were taken down, the channel owners amnesticized, and the current containment procedures developed.

**Spokesperson** : Hello, I'm Olivia McConnell. My grandfather is a very important politician, and we've been using helth by dado for the last six months. His job often keeps him very busy and makes him very tired, but thanks to helth by dado's 'superbond'[5](javascript:;), we're never apart!"

**Morris** : I used to try the Bathory method to make myself younger. Really messy, and the smell! Horrible.
_Cut to the elderly man loading corpses into an indoor incinerator._
**Morris** : But, then I saw the advertisement in the Sunday paper, and thought I should give it a try.

_Cut to a before-and-after comparison; one shows a man similar in appearance to the actor playing the elderly man. The other shows a man who appears to be in his fifties._
**Morris** : And ever since then, I've just been getting younger and younger. Now I don't need to do the Bathory method anymore. But I still do! Because it's fun. helth by dado has given me my youth back, and I'll forever be thankful for it.

[5](javascript:;). An alleged 'paltonic aphoridiac'[sic] which is meant to aid in the repairing of familial relationships; in reality, 'superbond' is grape-flavored CBD oil, diluted to the point where any narcotic or pharmaceutical effects are non-existent.
[6](javascript:;). The record was transmitted directly to Dr. William Wettle’s workstation computer at Site-43, from an unknown source.
[7](javascript:;). The writing on screen is made to look like disclaimers often included in prescription drug commercials but is in fact the entirety of Act II of the 1664 theatrical comedy, Tartuffe.
[8](javascript:;). An 'anti-aging' skincare cream which is 50% moisturizer, 50% cortizone cream.

[10](javascript:;). The pacing of the message fading in and out over the video, when compared to Morse code, translates to “When you’re broke, and you just can’t stand the sight of your face in the mirror anymore, health products like helth by dado are the only reasonable solution. Otherwise, maybe it’s time to consider the failure of your existence and the fact that vapidly buying things won’t fill that gaping hole in your life. helth by dado is now 35% off for a limited time.”
