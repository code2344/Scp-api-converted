SCP-8353 manifestation on Researcher Clemente.

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-8353 is currently uncontainable. Any cases of SCP-8353 are to be immediately brought under the jurisdiction of the Foundation.
**Description:** SCP-8353 is a medical anomaly characterized by the spontaneous appearance of a Coffman engine starter embedded at the base of a subject’s skull. Manifestation of SCP-8353 coincides with or is the direct cause of prolonged unconsciousness within affected subjects.
A Coffman engine starter was a now-defunct ignition mechanism used to engage piston engines, most commonly in military aircraft and vehicles during World War II. These devices operated by firing a shotgun shell to generate high-pressure gas, which spun the engine’s crankshaft. In standard use, a cartridge is loaded into the slot, sealed with a hinged cap, and struck with a hammer.
SCP-8353 instances mirror this design. A steel cartridge slot is fused to the subject's occipital bone and connects via a short steel pipe directly into the brainstem. Subjects affected by SCP-8353 experience little to no brain activity and enter a state akin to hibernation, displaying a lowered metabolic rate, heart rate, body temperature, and cessation of waste production. Due to this, it is likely that previous subjects were mistakenly presumed dead rather than suffering from an anomalous affliction. In many instances, the engine starter is obscured by hair, further complicating identification.
**Addendum 8353.1:** Testing
The Foundation discovered SCP-8353 when it manifested on Researcher Cody Clemente of Site-17. The above documentation was written shortly after this discovery, and Site-17 personnel convened to assess an appropriate course of action. Researchers proposed that, much like its intended function, the engine starter could be used to initiate consciousness, effectively "starting" Clemente.
A shotgun shell was loaded into the SCP-8353 slot at the base of Clemente’s skull. A small steel cap was secured over the slot, and the assembly was struck with a hammer. Clemente’s head instantly exploded. Revival was deemed unsuccessful.
