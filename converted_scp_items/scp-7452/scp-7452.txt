Special Containment Procedures:

 SCP-7452 is to be contained in an item locker at Site-56. Research is currently underway to identify a possible method to awaken SCP-7452 for experimentation.

Description:

 SCP-7452 is the skull of an 

Ursus americanus

 (black bear) possessing an intense fluctuating signature of Elan-Vital Energy (EVE). The item was obtained from Eric Klammanski, designated PoI-7452.

According to PoI-7452, when SCP-7452 is active, it possesses flames in its eye sockets and speaks in a deep, masculine voice. The item is allegedly able to predict future events including, but not limited to, games of chance. The user is required to sacrifice blood to SCP-7452 before soliciting it for predictions.

Following its acquisition by the Foundation, SCP-7452 is presently dormant. A method of awakening it has not been determined due to a lack of knowledge held by PoI-7452 regarding such a process.

Addendum:

 SCP-7452 was obtained in Kyuzhevitz, North Carolina, USA. Prior to containment, PoI-7452 attempted to use information gathered from the object to win the Super-Duper Millions Jackpot on July 18, 2014. A video was filmed by a bystander during the event and posted to social media; PoI-7452 admitted to the existence of SCP-7452 in this video, alerting Foundation webcrawlers. Site-56 personnel were dispatched and successfully detained PoI-7452.

Following containment, the convenience store in which the aforementioned event occurred was identified. The store's security footage of the event was obtained successfully; the transcript below has been written with data gathered from both the security footage and the video filmed by the bystander.

Transcript 7452-1

Location:

 Choi's Corner Market in Kyuzhevitz, NC, USA

Date:

 July 18, 2014

Foreword:

 The Super-Duper Millions Jackpot draws its numbers every Friday at 22:00 EDT.

<Begin Log>

It is 21:50 EDT. PoI-7452 is waiting behind another customer at the cash register, fidgeting with a piece of paper. His right hand is bandaged. He continuously checks his wristwatch and wipes the sweat from his face.

The customer in front of PoI-7452 finishes the transaction and walks away from the counter. The clerk, identified as store owner Kang-doo Choi, waves goodbye.

Choi:

 Thank you, come again!

Choi turns towards PoI-7452 as the latter approaches the counter with the paper.

PoI-7452 grins as he sets the paper on the counter and claps his hands.

PoI-7452:

 Choi, my man! You know the drill, one Super-Duper ticket my good sir.

Choi frowns as PoI-7452 points at the paper.

PoI-7452:

 I got the winning numbers 

right here

, they're uh…

PoI-7452 looks down at the paper.

PoI-7452:

 Eight, six, seventy-five, thirty…

PoI-7452 looks up at Choi, who is shaking his head.

Choi:

 Eric, out of good conscience, I refuse to sell you any more lotto tickets.

PoI-7452:

 Wha- how come?!

Choi:

 You've spent thousands of dollars on the lotto. Scratchers, Super-Duper, Lucky Horseshoe, and every time you win 

nothing

.

PoI-7452:

 Okay, but now I 

know

 the numbers, Choi. I'll actually win now, just let me enter one last time!

Choi:

 I will 

not

 indulge your addiction anymore, for your own good.

PoI-7452:

 Sir, just- after this, after today, I'll be set for life! Please just sell me the ticket!

Choi:

 No means no, Eric.

PoI-7452 rubs his forehead and hair with his hands.

PoI-7452:

 You know you're losing my money by refusing me service, right Choi?

Choi looks at the line of customers behind PoI-7452, one of which is holding up a smartphone to film the event.

Choi:

 I can survive without watching you suffer. There's paying customers behind you with places to be.

PoI-7452 checks his watch.

PoI-7452:

 Shit, nine fifty-four!

PoI-7452 holds up the paper and points at it.

PoI-7452:

 These numbers'll expire in six minutes! I need to play them 

now!

Choi:

 Play them next week, today you take a break.

PoI-7452:

 But Choi, I can't- I can't play them next week, I told you!

Choi:

 Why not?

PoI-7452 pauses to breathe and wipe his brow.

PoI-7452:

 Look, uh… I found this bear skull, right? It was like a- a magic skull, it could talk to me and predict the future. I had to give it my blood…

PoI-7452 shows Choi his bandaged hand.

PoI-7452:

 …to get it to tell me today's lottery numbers. The problem is, after it told me, it fell asleep, and I don't know how to wake it up for next week's lottery. So that's how I got these numbers and why I need to use them 

today.

Choi stares at PoI-7452.

Choi:

 You need to see a doctor.

PoI-7452:

 Wait- no, I'm not bullshitting, I promise! Just let me play one more time, sir! Please!

PoI-7452 clasps his hands together.

PoI-7452:

 Mister Choi, I beg you. Just one more game, then I'll never, 

ever

 play again. I'll give you twenty-five… thirty percent of the winnings.

PoI-7452 leans forward towards Choi.

PoI-7452:

 Just 

one

 more time, then I'll quit forever. Please sir, 

please.

Choi looks behind PoI-7452 at the line of customers. He takes a deep breath.

Choi:

 This 

will

 be your last lotto, Eric. What are the numbers again?

PoI-7452 pumps his fists.

PoI-7452:

 YES! Okay, uh… eight, six, seventy-five, thirty, and nine.

Choi:

 …seventy-five, thirty-nine?

PoI-7452:

 No, it's…

PoI-7452 holds up the paper towards Choi and points at the numbers on it.

PoI-7452:

 It's thirty, as in "three-zero", and 

then

 the last number is nine.

Choi:

 Three-zero, and nine. Five dollars.

PoI-7452 inserts his credit card into the card reader. It beeps twice.

Choi:

 It declined.

PoI-7452:

 NO!!

PoI-7452 turns towards the line of customers behind him.

PoI-7452:

 Can someone pay for me? I'll pay you back, I promise!

The other customers snicker at PoI-7452.

Customer 1:

 Get a job!

PoI-7452:

 You don't get it! I found a magic skull and it told me today's lottery numbers! One more play and I'm set for life!

Customer 2:

 Go see a shrink, you junkie!

PoI-7452 scratches his head and looks at his watch.

PoI-7452:

 Look, uh… I got a blanket and a pack of Newports in my car, I'll give them to you, just someone 

please

 help a brother out!

Another customer checks her phone, then looks at PoI-7452.

Customer 3:

 If I pay, will you finally leave?

PoI-7452:

 Yes yes yes! Please!

Customer 3 sighs and approaches the counter. She places her six-pack of beer on the counter, Choi scans it.

Choi:

 With the lotto ticket, it's eleven ninety-seven.

The customer inserts her credit card into the reader. It beeps once; Choi nods his head at PoI-7452.

The lottery ticket is printed out, Choi hands it to PoI-7452, who examines it.

PoI-7452:

 Nine fifty-nine! I fucking made it! Nine fifty-nine!

PoI-7452 laughs as he pumps his fists in the air.

Customer 3:

 Excuse me, my Newports?

PoI-7452:

 Of course, of course! Thank you so, so, 

so

 much, ma'am!

PoI-7452 looks at Choi.

PoI-7452:

 And Choi, you're the man as always! Thank you for coming around!

Customer 3 and PoI-7452 exit the store as the latter points at Choi.

PoI-7452:

 As I promised, twenty percent!

Following this event, the winning numbers given by SCP-7452 were revealed to have been for the North Carolina Lucky Horseshoe Lottery, and not the Super-Duper Millions Jackpot.
