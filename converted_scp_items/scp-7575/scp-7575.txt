Description:

 SCP-7575 is a small

1

 metallic

2

 cube

3

 previously filed as a minor anomalous object.

4

 SCP-7575 constantly emits a low, droning sound.

5

 Object was discovered after having landed in an isolated forest near Great Slave Lake, Canada

6

, presumably from extraterrestrial orbit.

7

SCP-7575 was discovered following a series of routine tests performed on anomalous objects. Subsequent events led to the conclusion of several indirectly observed/confirmed sentient entities being unaccounted-for personnel.

8

The Foundation became aware of additional anomalous properties following the semi-accidental discovery of an Extra-Reality Data Cache (ERDC-7575) by Dr. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

, now known as

.

Stored inside the cache was a database of over 247,000 entries detailing mundane actions and activities carried out by a collective team of 12 supposed Foundation personnel, led by 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 . The circumstances that led to the creation of the cache and the team are unknown

10

, however, it was within the cache that additional information regarding SCP-7575 became known.

11

SCP-7575 imposes a known/unknown set of criteria upon all sapient

12

 concepts. Following the fulfillment of these criteria, an individual's existence and direct cumulative existential consequences will be erased from reality

13

, and be replaced

14

 by alternative causal routing. A small number of these criteria are known utilizing the final entries

15

 of each of the personnel detailed in ERDC-7575. These include:

Viewing SCP-7575.

Possessing knowledge of SCP-7575's appearance.

Viewing SCP-7575's documentation.

Possessing knowledge of SCP-7575's origin.

Counting to 377.

Having been a passenger of an automobile.

16

Playing a game of chess using an illegitimate codified ruleset.

Drinking a cup of room temperature coffee.

10

. Do not verify without authorization.

11

. SCP-7575 was discovered included in a cache of anomalous objects bequeathed to the Foundation by an unknown third party.

12

. Analysis of power usage suggests the absence of SCP-

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 and SCP-

13

. We do not know where they go.

14

. Do not verify without authorization.

15

. Largely speculative but associated with a partially comprehensible set of SCP-7575 criteria.

16

. Requires primary semantic conceptual perception of the vehicle as an automobile, not a car, truck, sedan, or any semantic-causally related concept.

17

. Exact nature unknown. Hypothesized to result in a tangential causative relation between unrelated concepts.

18

. Budgetary discrepancies indicate a fiscal absence of approximately 450 personnel.
