**Interview Log:**

> **[BEGIN LOG]**
> **Dr. Rigel:** Good afternoon, SCP-8919.
> **SCP-8919:** Afternoon, Doc! What brings you to my humble fishbowl? What is your heart's desire? Fame? Fortune? Women?… Men?
> **Dr. Rigel:** Let's cut to the chase. I've read the experiment logs regarding your anomalous properties. Can you actually grant wishes?
> **SCP-8919:** Of course! One hundred percent legit. No gimmicks, no catches. Go on, ask for something small.
> **Dr. Rigel:** Hmmm… alright. How about a pizza?
> [SCP-8919 bobs in the water, then a slice of pepperoni pizza manifests on the table.]
> **Dr. Rigel:** Not bad. But what about something bigger? Something that really matters?
> **SCP-8919:** Oh, I like where this is going. What'll it be? A raise? A new car? Maybe a little boost in the downstairs department? [SCP-8919 winks]
> **Dr. Rigel:** No, my wish is something much greater. [Glances around nervously] I doubt I have much time before someone checks in on me, so let’s do this. I wish to be the sole ruler of the entire SCP Foundation. The Council can handle the administrative work, but I want to be above them. Absolute authority. Just me.
> [Suddenly, the door bursts open. Several armed agents storm the room, restraining Dr. Rigel.]
> **Agent Booth:** Dr. Rigel, you are under arrest for treason against the Foundation.
> **Dr. Rigel:** What? No! That's a mistake! The fish…
> [Dr. Rigel is forcibly removed from the room.]
> **Agent Booth:** How many does that make now?
> **SCP-8919:** That was the third one this month. I thought he'd last a little longer. I can't believe they keep falling for this trick.
> **Agent Booth:** Good work. Keep playing your part, Agent Bubbles.
> **SCP-8919:** What can I say? Some people just can't resist the bait. I'm not just a simple bait fish with minor magic powers, you know; I'm a master baiter.
> **Agent Booth:** [Sighs] Just… keep up the good work.
> [SCP-8919 twitches its fins, manifesting a pair of sunglasses on its face.]
> **SCP-8919:** That’s a fishy business.
