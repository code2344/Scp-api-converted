"our lies convince, but, we have the skill, when we will, to create the truth"

 

Are We Cool Yet?

Are We Cool Yet

 is an invitation-only artist collective dedicated to creating the most impactful, thought provoking meaningful works of art that can exist. We use our anomalous gifts to create art that could not exist without us, art that questions the foundational assumptions society works off of, art that will revolutionize the world.

Who Are We?

We are artists. Independent thinkers. Rebels against the status quo. We see the potential, and we seize it. Morality? Weakness? Boredom? Non-coolness? We reject it all, eschewing the shackles of commercial art, and elevating ourselves into a higher state of being.

We are the Artists and the World is Our Canvas.

We are a council of experts, each with our own laundry list of accolades, artworks and insights - together we shape what our collective is, by coordinating events, allocating funds, planning exhibitions and more!

Membership to the Arts Council is offered to members on a case-by-case basis, and happens once per year during the

The Critic

Imogen Harper, The Critic (2008-2010)

 

So Who Is 'The Critic?'

The Critic is an appointed position that determines the overall vision, mission and message of 

Are We Cool Yet

. They are chosen on the retirement of the former Critic, selected from who we feel are the most promising up-and-coming artists, revolutionizing the anomalous art world.

 

Former Critics have been undiscovered maestros, reclusive artistic hermits, Deer College Students, mothers, conceptual beings and more! We are always looking for new potential candidates for the position of Critic, so who knows, YOU might be nextâ€¦
