 Neutralised

Artistic representation of the banana.

Special Containment Procedures:

 Remains of SCP-3071 incinerated. Testing has concluded. Martha Langley’s pets, one cat and two ferrets, went into the possession of Site 126 security guard Michael Pearson, all since deceased.

Description:

 SCP-3071 was the materialisation of a non-anomalous Cavendish banana in the head of Martha Langley on March 23rd, 1987 at her home in Aberdeen, Scotland.

SCP-3071 resulted in the separation and ejection of most of Martha Langley’s brain tissue and skull. Fragments of both were found in adjacent spaces to the dining room SCP-3071 occurred in, and various stains were present on all walls and the ceiling. Martha Langley is thought to have died between 0 and 0.5 seconds after SCP-3071. The banana also exploded.

The Foundation was made aware of SCP-3071 after a suicide report and police intervention. A cause for SCP-3071 has never been identified, but multiple have been disproven including teleportation, manual insertion and the Warhol effect.
