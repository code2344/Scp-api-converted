View of SCP-7186 from research outpost

Item #:

 SCP-7186

Object Class:

 Safe

Special Containment Procedures:

 Due to its size and location, direct containment of SCP-7186 is untenable at the current time, feasibility of containment is to be reassessed in future under the direction of Dr. Juliet Grey. The area around SCP-7186’s initial discovery site is to be fenced off under the guise of a mining related chemical spill. Indirect containment is to be maintained through the dissemination of a variety of cover stories. Foundation webcrawler Metatron.IO is to monitor forums and conferences related to geology, volcanology and oceanography for references to, and discussions of, SCP-7186. Individuals arguing against currently disseminated cover stories are to be covertly administered Class-C amnestics, with current cover stories implanted over the individual’s pre-existing hypotheses regarding SCP-7186.

Update 19/03/2026:

 Previously amnesticised individuals who continue to be flagged by Metatron.IO for discussions surrounding SCP-7186 are to be brought in for questioning at the discretion of Dr. Juliet Grey.

Description:

 SCP-7186 is a 14.3km

3

 deposit of obsidian, roughly 200 km northwest of the town of Coober Pedy, South Australia. Initial testing revealed the obsidian to be non-anomalous, however either the apparent age or location of the anomaly should be impossible within currently accepted geological models.

The surrounding rock is cretaceous in origin, and the brittle, amorphous obsidian should not be capable of surviving the millions of years of energetic subduction the Australian tectonic plate has experienced since its formation. If the obsidian is not as old as the surrounding rock, no known mechanism would explain its presence over 1500km from the nearest known volcanically active region.

Discovery:

 SCP-7186 was first uncovered by opal miners in central South Australia in late April 2023, who reported the unusual find to Geoscience Australia. Subsequent gravity surveys by Geoscience Australia established the extent of the anomalous deposit, at which point the Foundation was alerted to the existence of the anomaly by an embedded agent.

Despite Foundation efforts to confiscate the initial surveys and amnesticise those involved in their production, several copies of the surveys had been sent to an unknown number of individuals. It was decided that the extensive operations required to retrieve the copies were an unnecessary expense, given the low disruption risk posed by the anomaly, and the current containment procedures were implemented instead.

A temporary research outpost was established close to the initial site of discovery under the purview of Site-220. Researcher Dr. Juliet Grey was identified as the highest ranked Foundation geologist currently assigned to a site located within Australia, and was subsequently designated as the Head Researcher for SCP-7186.

Addendum 1:

On 13/3/2024 the first paper written by the SCP-7186 research team was published through the Foundation front organisation Sediment and Crystallisation Periodical serving as the initial cover story for SCP-7186. The abstract of the paper is included below.

The Great Victoria Desert Gravity Anomaly (27° 22': 131° 27')

1

 is a recently identified region in the South-Eastern Great Victoria Desert, in the general vicinity of Coober Pedy, SA. Identification of the material represented by the GVD Gravity Anomaly is complicated by the presence of an industrial mining accident in the region. Material at the anomaly is distinct from the surrounding granite, as evidenced by available gravity surveys of the area.

Based on known data surrounding the Great Victoria Desert's paleogeology, the material represented by the anomaly is most likely an intrusive, felsic, igneous rock, with the probability that it is granitic being high. The exact proportion of orthoclase and plagioclase feldspars present within the material cannot be determined at this time, however we hypothesise that they are approximately equal. The specific gravity recorded suggests a finer grained porphyritic rock makes up the majority of the material represented by the anomaly.

The anomaly most likely represents a previously unidentified deposit of quartz monzonite that formed from an intrusion with a lower silica density than the surrounding regions.

Following the publication of the paper mentioned in Addendum 1, an email exchange occurred between Dr. Grey and Site-220 Director Alex Anderson, recorded below.

There's no way this cover story holds up. My team have done the best job they possibly can, but most of them aren't even geologists; anything we can come up with is going to get torn to pieces by anyone with even a shred of professional credibility.

You need to allocate more personnel to the project, preferably personnel with actual schooling in the field we're researching.

Dr. Grey,

As I told you the last time you requested an increase in funding, it is the opinion of my own office, and of the Overwatch Council, that the SCP-7186 project is receiving adequate funding and resources for the level of threat a breach poses to the integrity of the veil.

As I told you last time you gave me the same canned response, the Overwatch Council is wrong. They think that, because this isn't some big, stupid murder-monster, it isn't a danger to the veil- and that line of thinking is inexcusably wrong. Once word starts getting around about this thing, and it will, I can promise you that, it's going to be the most significant geological discovery in decades. We lack the manpower to build a genuinely convincing cover story, and if we can't do that then we're just drawing further attention to it.

Maybe we would have better luck covering this thing up if we actually knew what it was. Let me hire some real geologists so I can let my team do their jobs.

Dr. Grey,

Your complaints about staffing have been noted and will be passed along to Administration and Oversight. It has been brought to my attention that the most recent addition to the SCP-7186 research team has adequate qualifications for the task you have been given. You are to ensure knowledge of the anomaly remains exclusively within the hands of Foundation personnel with the resources that have been made available. If you believe the current cover story is insufficient, it is the opinion of this office that your team begin work on a new cover story.

Work with what you have Dr. Grey. I can't give you any more.

Adequate qualifications? Junior Researcher Ward has a BA in Human Geography and a Major in American Indian Studies, Anderson. I appreciate everything he does for the team but those are hardly 'adequate qualifications' to be studying an unprecedented geological phenomenon.

Addendum 3:

Despite attempts by the SCP-7186 research team to disseminate the above paper, awareness of SCP-7186's nature as an obsidian deposit continued to grow in online and academic geological communities. Necessary amnesticisations increased by 186% between 1/3/2024 and 30/9/2024, representing an escalating cost of containment. The SCP-7186 research team was directed to focus all efforts on the publication of a second cover story, in the belief that multiple false narratives would muddy the waters and decrease the chances of interested individuals uncovering the truth.

The following email correspondences were retrieved from the account of Dr. Juliet Grey after receiving the updated directives:

You want us to come up with another cover story? In less time? Am I reading these directives correctly Anderson?

I warned you what would happen, and I was right. We spent our best shot early trying to spin 7186 as adamellite and people didn't buy it, because not everyone who works in geology has rocks for brains. A firehose of falsehoods isn't going to help here, we need a new approach.

Upon leaving the conference venue, Dr. Grey was seen on the service entrance security cameras sat on the floor crying. No sound was recorded by the camera. An individual identified as Junior Researcher Ward approached and sat beside Dr. Grey. They appear to have conversed for 1 minute and 34 seconds before Dr. Grey stood, wiped her eyes with the sleeve of her labcoat, helped Junior Researcher Ward to stand and exited the camera's frame.

Addendum 5:

On 6/2/2025, Foundation webcrawlers identified a newly published paper by one Dr. Folorunso Fatukasi arguing against the currently disseminated cover stories for SCP-7186. As Dr. Fatukasi had already received 4 rounds of amnestic treatment following previous incidents related to the anomaly, Dr. Juliet Grey was notified of the situation. At her insistence, Dr. Grey was granted permission to interview Dr. Fatukasi at Site-220.

Transcription of interview of Dr. Folorunso Fatukasi by Dr. Juliet Grey:

<Begin Log>

Dr. Fatukasi is seated in interview room 27 in Site 220. Dr. Grey enters carrying a clipboard which slips out of her hand as she closes the door behind her. She hurriedly collects the clipboard and stands, extending a hand to Dr. Fatukasi, looking visibly flustered.

Grey

: Ah, apologies, thank you for agreeing to this meeting Dr. Fatukasi- I know we’re a, uh, a little out of the way.

Dr. Fatukasi shakes Dr. Grey’s hand. The latter hurriedly takes a seat opposite.

Fatukasi

: Not at all, your organisation has been very accommodating Dr… Grey, is it?

Grey

: Yes, I believe we met before at the… ah, no, you probably wouldn’t remember that- well we’ve definitely been to the same conference once or twice.

Dr. Fatukasi raises an eyebrow but does not otherwise react.

Fatukasi

: Indeed. Dr. Grey, can I ask what precisely is the purpose of this meeting? The request I received was markedly light on details.

Grey

: Right, yes, of course. Well, we would like to discuss your research on SC- on the Great Victoria Desert Obsidian Deposit, we believe we have some… this is hard to phrase right.

Dr. Grey taps the table several times and puts the clipboard to her temple while Dr. Fatukasi raises both eyebrows.

Grey

: We think we may be able to fill some gaps in your approach- oh not that there’s anything wrong with your approach! You’re an exceptional geologist!- but there’s some things you can’t possibly be aware of and I would like to be able to help fill in those gaps.

Dr. Fatukasi looks perplexed but leans forward and interlaces his fingers.

Fatukasi

: That’s… an interesting statement to make, but it would be rude of me not to indulge someone taking an interest in my work. What is it you think you know that I don’t?

Grey

: I don’t- I can’t tell you that until you answer some questions for us first, Dr. Fatukasi. I’m afraid, if you aren’t comfortable with that we will have to cut this meeting short, is that alright?

Fatukasi

: Is that so? Ask away then Dr. Grey, what is it you want to know?

Grey

: Thank you, well um. First of all: what keeps drawing- what draws you to the Great Victoria Desert Obsidian Deposit? You seem uniquely interested in it.

Dr. Fatukasi is visibly taken aback.

Fatukasi

: Uniquely?- the GVD Obsidian Deposit is possibly the most important geological discovery since… since… well, since plate tectonics frankly. If I am uniquely interested in it, that only means no one else realises what they’re looking at! This could rewrite everything we think we know about volcanology, hell, geology as a whole!

Dr. Grey leans onto the table as Dr. Fatukasi grows more animated.

Grey

: Yes, yes! It’s-

Dr. Grey clears her throat, closes her eyes and sits back, exhaling slowly.

Grey

: Excuse me, that was unprofessional. Now Dr. Fatukasi, what are your thoughts on the most prevalent hypotheses regarding the GVD Obsidian Deposit?

Fatukasi

: That can’t be a real question can it? They’re nonsense, plain and simple, utterly impossible, and I’ve lost a lot of respect in many of my peers for going along with such drivel. I’m not sure where these ideas come from frankly, certainly not any journals that deserve any further attention. If I didn’t know better, I would be crying conspiracy.

Grey

: You should.

Dr. Grey’s nerves seem to calm and her expression hardens.

Fatukasi

: Yes I- excuse me?

Grey

: You should be crying conspiracy doctor. Well no, hmm, we would rather you didn’t, but you would be correct.

Dr. Fatukasi stands, resting his hands on the table and leaning closer to Dr. Grey.

Fatukasi

: Speak plainly Dr. Grey, what exactly are you insinuating here?

Grey

: I represent an organisation known as The Foundation. Management would prefer me to give you the whole spiel- well they would prefer I hold my tongue actually- but I’ll give it to you straight: we are the conspiracy. You’re right about the deposit, it shouldn’t exist, there is no way it can possibly be where it is, and yet it is there, and it’s not unique. There are many things in this world that shouldn’t exist, and we stop the world from finding that out.

Dr. Fatukasi takes a step back.

Fatukasi

: This is insane, thats-

Grey

: Apologies Dr. Fatukasi but I’m not finished, I would appreciate if you would take a seat.

Dr. Fatukasi hesitates but returns to his chair.

Grey

: Thank you. I’ve put you in a compromising situation here doctor, and I apologise for that. You can’t be allowed to leave here knowing what I’ve just told you, we can’t take that risk, so I’m going to give you a choice. You can walk out of here, you will be made to forget everything; this meeting, the GVD Obsidian Deposit, and most likely your entire field of study. Currently, the chances you'll become interested in the deposit again are too high for us to accept. Or, you can work for me, help me find out why the deposit exists, and how to keep others from stumbling upon it.

Fatukasi

: I- this is- how can you possibly-

Dr. Grey stands.

Grey

: I understand this is a lot to take in at once. We can’t let you leave, but you will be provided accommodation for the remainder of the day, so take the time you need to make a decision. It may be presumptive of me to say, but I look forward to working with you.

Dr. Grey smiles weakly at Dr. Fatukasi, and exits the room. She can be heard exhaling shakily before the door closes. Dr. Fatukasi remains sat in silent contemplation.

<End Log>

Following the above interview Dr. Grey was escorted to the office of Site-220 Director Alex Anderson by site security.

Below is a transcription of security footage recorded within the office.

<Begin Log>

Director Anderson is sat behind their desk, dark wood scattered with trinkets from minor tourist attractions across Australia. A short, potted palm tree sits to their left. The room is otherwise unadorned. The door swings open and Dr. Grey enters. Much of her hair has come loose from the bun it was tied in during the interview with Dr. Fatukasi, and she appears to be shivering. Director Anderson gestures to the chair opposite them and Dr. Grey moves to sit. She closes her eyes and her breathing slows as she takes a seat. When she opens them her shivering has stopped.

Anderson

: Out of appreciation for services rendered I’m giving you an opportunity to explain yourself before I make an official recommendation to the O5 Council that you be removed from this research project and, at best, demoted.

Grey

: With all the respect due to your station director, I’m doing exactly as I was instructed.

Director Anderson sits back and cocks their head slightly to the left with a confounded look on their face.

Anderson

: And how do you figure that doctor?

Grey

: To quote your direction verbatim, I am to ‘ensure knowledge of the anomaly remains exclusively within the hands of Foundation personnel with the resources that have been made available’, and that is precisely what I am doing. It is my firm belief that the only ethical and effective way to keep that knowledge contained is to bring Dr. Fatukasi to our side of the veil. Multiple rounds of amnestic treatment have done nothing to dampen or distract his interest in the anomaly, our current containment procedures have summarily failed to keep him out, and my team lacks the resources we would need to achieve that goal. At this juncture, we either bring him in, or accept that we are incapable of maintaining the integrity of the veil. Which would you prefer, director?

Anderson

: That’s a staggering misinterpretation of your orders and you know it. You can dress it up in whatever language you choose, I cannot sign off on such a reckless act of hubris. I’m afraid I will have to recommend you be replaced as-

Dr. Grey slams a hand onto the table, knocking over miniature replicas of the Big Lobster, Big Pineapple, and Golden Gumboot.

Grey

: Replaced by who, Alex? Who are they going to replace me with? Out of all Foundation staff in Australia, 

I'm

 the highest ranking member with a geology degree, and I’m not even a Senior Researcher. Who do they have to replace me with? Do you honestly expect them to fly someone in from -19 to oversee a “minimum priority” research project in the arse end of nowhere? You know as well as I do that they’ll stick the badge on some no-name yes-man who understands the gravity of 7186 as well as a galah understands astrophysics.

Director Anderson removes their glasses and rubs their eyes with their thumb and index finger.

Anderson

: Even if I entertain the hypothetical that you’re right, what do you expect me to do Juliet? Accounting won’t even assign the budget for weekly perimeter checks for 7186 and you want me to ask them to find the resources to recruit and onboard a new researcher?

Grey

: I don’t care how you ask them director, tell them to take the costs out of my wages if you have to- it’s not like I have any opportunities to use them anyway- but if you don’t make this happen I won’t have any choice but to quit and try to live it up before the veil comes crashing down.

Anderson

: Dr. Grey, neither of us wants to have to get Fire Suppression involved in-

Grey

: I know, that’s why I know you won’t. Find the time, find the funds, make this happen Anderson; you need me on this, and I need Fatukasi.

Dr. Grey stands to leave, and Director Anderson lets out an exasperated sigh.

Anderson

: Has anyone ever told you that you’re impossible to work with Juliet?

Grey

: Frequently.

Dr. Grey exits the room, placing her shaking hands in the pockets of her lab coat.

<End Log>

Shortly after leaving the Site Director’s office, a security camera in an adjacent corridor showed Dr. Grey crouched against a wall with her hands covering her face. Muffled screaming could be heard on the recording.

Addendum 6:

The following note was added to the employment file of Dr. Juliet Grey following discussion of disciplinary measures between Site-220 Chief of Administration and Oversight Donna Guyula and Site-220 Director Alex Anderson.

As per the recommendation of Site Director Anderson, the wage of Researcher Dr. Juliet Grey is to be reduced by 80% for a period not shorter than 2 fiscal years. It is agreed by the offices of the Director of Site-220 and the Chief of Administration and Oversight of Site-220 that this disciplinary action is sufficient punishment for the contractual infactions committed by the subject of these disciplinary proceedings, and no further action need be taken on this matter.

Addendum 7:

On 11/3/2025 Researcher Dr. Folorunso Fatukasi was assigned to the SCP-7186 research team as Deputy Head Researcher. The following email was retrieved from the recycle bin of Dr. Juliet Grey's Scipmail account.

Addendum 8:

On 17/12/2025 a paper co-authored by Drs. Grey and Fatukasi was submitted for internal Foundation peer review, proposing an explanation for the presence and continued stability of SCP-7186

3

. The crux of the paper's hypothesis is Dr. Fatukasi's discovery that SCP-7186 appears to be unshackled to the movement of the Australian Plate.

The Australian Plate moves approximately 6.9cm per year northward, while SCP-7186's latitude appears to have remained constant in the time since its initial discovery. This obervation was noted by Dr. Fatukasi during a yearly review of Geoscience Australia's gravity surveys. The mechanisms by which SCP-7186 remains fixed in place, and the continental plate appears to shift around SCP-7186, are currently unknown, but Fatukasi-Grey et al. have proposed the Fixed Geological Point hypothesis as an initial explanation. Further study is ongoing.

Addendum 9:

On 4/1/2026, a quarterly joint review of expenditure and containment success rates by the Site-220 Accounting Department and the Analytics Department found that, since 1/1/2025, spending on the SCP-7186 project had fallen by 9% and breach incidents had fallen by 23%. The predominant reduction in expenditure was identified as the result of a significant reduction in MTF deployments and amnestic utilisation, which the Analytics Department primarily attributes to the hiring and work of Dr. Fatukasi. When made aware of this review, Dr. Grey submitted the following proposal to Director Anderson for consideration by O5 command:

From:

grey.juliet@220.scp.int

To:

anderson.alex@220.scp.int

Subject:

For your consideration

Date:

25/1/2026

Please find attached my team's proposal for the reclassification of SCP-7186 from Safe to Radix, and its integration into the procedures for its own containment.

In simple terms, we propose that those individuals willing and able to penetrate through the layers of obfuscation represented by the current containment procedures be invited, at my discretion, to join the SCP-7186 research team, and the Foundation as a whole.

Included in the complete proposal is an estimated cost-benefit analysis of this process, using the case study of my Deputy Head of Research Dr. Folorunso Fatukasi and the immense benefit he has provided to both the containment and research of SCP-7186. It is my firm belief that replicating the success his employment has represented to our team is the most cost effective and productive approach to the ongoing containment of the anomaly in question.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Dr. Juliet V Grey Phd.

Director Anderson forwarded the proposal to O5 Command, adding their own recommendation that the SCP-7186 project be removed from the jurisdiction of Site-220, in favour of an independent research arm. They sent the following email in reply to Dr. Grey:

Addendum 10:

Following a vote by the O5 Council, Dr. Juliet Grey is hereby appointed head of the newly founded Department of Geology. The department is to be based out of the expanded research outpost atop SCP-7186, hereafter renamed Research and Containment Site-46.
