**Item #:** SCP-6510
**Object Class:** Safe
**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-6510 is kept in two separately-secured standard safe-class storage containers in Site-106. Requests for further testing should be directed to the Department of Procurement and Liquidation.

One half of SCP-6510. Stored separately to prevent improper usage.
**Description:** SCP-6510 is a pair of stainless steel ring piercings.
SCP-6510's anomalous effects do not activate when worn on the earlobes, nasal septum, bellybutton, eyebrows, lips, tongue, or genitals, nor when only one of the two pieces is worn.
SCP-6510's primary effect activates when both pieces are worn on human _papilla mammaria_. The wearer of SCP-6510 obtains the ability to accelerate SCP-6510 at up to 5g[1](javascript:;). SCP-6510 applies a tensile force to the user's body, providing the capability for self-directed aerial motion. The acceleration of SCP-6510 is invariant to the mass of the wearer's body: regardless of body mass, subjects using SCP-6510 reach a consistent maximum acceleration.
SCP-6510's secondary effect imparts increased tensile and compressive strength to its wearer's body tissues. The wearer's _papilla mammaria_ become fully resistant to traumatic amputation. Wearers of SCP-6510 routinely survive high-velocity collisions without sustaining permanent injury.
All wearers of SCP-6510 have reported perfect real-time control over SCP-6510. The pre-containment owner of SCP-6510 used it as a means of rapid airborne transport; replication of this capability for specialized Foundation agents has proven infeasible for reasons discovered in the course of testing.
Test subjects universally report that SCP-6510 does not have any anesthetic effects, and neural activity scans show activate of the anterior cingulate consistent with pain induced by 5gs of acceleration upon the _papilla mammaria._ All attempts to redistribute the force applied by SCP-6510 on its wearer have nullified its primary effect.
