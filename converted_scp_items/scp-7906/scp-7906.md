**Item #:** SCP-7906
**Object Class:** Keter

A still from one of the YouTube videos on SCP-7906 showing SCP-7906-1's appearance.
**Special Containment Procedures:** While SCP-7906's content is currently successfully censored, more direct means of containment are currently under investigation. Any attempts to remove SCP-7906 from YouTube have been unsuccessful, as it continued to reappear after each removal. As attempts to remove SCP-7906 from the web have proven futile, a Foundation Webcrawler has been set up to redirect viewers to the YouTube homepage when attempting to access SCP-7906. SCP-7906 is to be monitored by a staff member with XX sex chromosomes. Under no circumstances are recipes from SCP-7906 to be recreated.
**Description:** SCP-7906 refers to a channel on YouTube.com under the name of ‘MonicaMakesxo’. Videos from SCP-7906 focus on baking and cooking foods in a traditionally feminine aesthetic. Attempts to track down the person running SCP-7906 have been unsuccessful.
In a pattern corresponding with [SCP-4319](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-4319), SCP-7906 can only be viewed by those with XX sex chromosomes. If a person with non-XX sex chromosomes is sent a link to SCP-7906, it will lead to YouTube’s homepage.
SCP-7906-2 refers to any recipe demonstrated on SCP-7906. The anomalous effects of SCP-7906 take place when subjects who have XX sex chromosomes consume a recreated instance of SCP-7906-2.
When consumed, these recipes will cause the subject to experience symptoms typical of those suffering from Major Depressive Disorder. This effect does not wear off and thus is assumed to be permanent. It is unknown how closely the recipe has to be followed in order to trigger the anomalous effects. If eaten by a subject with non-XX sex chromosomes, the foods will have no effect. Excluding its anomalous effects, the end result of SCP-7906-2 is consistent with expected outcomes using similar cooking and baking techniques.
SCP-7906-1 refers to the entity that features in all SCP-7906's YouTube videos; 'Monica'. The consultation of current facial recognizing systems and databases has proven ineffective in discovering the identity of SCP-7906-1, as such, it is currently hypothesized that SCP-7906-1 may generate false images of itself. Similarly, other entities that feature on SCP-7906 are currently unidentified. SCP-7906-1 has been identified as both an affiliate and active member of GOI-4319 ("Just Girly Things").
**Addendum-1-Discovery:**
The Foundation was first alerted to SCP-7906 on 12/14/2020 after it was flagged by Foundation web crawlers. The first video that came to the Foundation's attention was titled '♡Perfect Girly Hot Chocolate for my best friend!- JGT♡', published on 12/07/2020. This video has been included in the addendum below under 'Video Transcript 12/07/2020'.
**Addendum-2-Transcripts:**
The following is a partial list of transcripts of videos posted by SCP-7906 up until the time of discovery in order of posting date.

A still from '♡The best heart sugar cookies- JGT♡'.
**Video Title:** ♡The best heart sugar cookies- JGT♡
_SCP-7906-1's opener plays. Clips of SCP-7906-1 baking and cooking flash across the screen while music plays._
_SCP-7906-1 is standing in a mostly pink-colored kitchen._
**SCP-7906-1:** Hello my girlies! Monica here! Are you wondering what to bake your man or bestie for this Valentine's Day? Well, do I have the video for you!
_A title card flashes across the screen stating 'The best heart sugar cookies'._
**SCP-7906-1:** Valentine's Day is important. It's when you get to go to your man, look at him with love in your eyes, and say 'I'm yours'. It's the day when you show your besties how much you appreciate them for sticking with you through thick and thin. And what better way to show that than a special treat where you can share your feelings?
_SCP-7906-1 claps its hands together_.
**SCP-7906-1:** Today for you I have the very most cutest ever Valentine's Day heart sugar cookies!
_SCP-7906-1 pans to a plate with decorated heart-shaped cookies._
**SCP-7906-1:** Who knows if yours can look as good as mine, but you can certainly try! First, you're going to need some ingredients!
_SCP-7906-1 begins to describe ingredients needed for baking the recipe, showing each item as it is described._
**SCP-7906-1:** If it looks like a lot, I promise it's not! It'll be rather easy!
_SCP-7906-1 begins to list out the recipe, showing itself baking as it does so. After it finishes, the camera cuts back to SCP-7906-1._
**SCP-7906-1:** And now we put it in the oven! That's the boring part, but we'll get to the exciting part soon! Firstly though, I'm going to talk to you about who I'm celebrating for Valentine's Day while it bakes.
_A picture of SCP-7906-1 and a man lovingly embracing each other flashes onto the screen_.
**SCP-7906-1:** This is my husband, Ron. Ron and I have been together for 6 years, and I just adore him. He's really been through me with it all. I was just 15 when I met him. I was a sophomore, he was a senior in high school when we met. I remember always staring at him in algebra class. He couldn't care less about me. But that's because we didn't know each other at the time. It's not like I was popular or hot. I was a total overweight pig.
_SCP-7906-1 gives a disgusted sigh._
**SCP-7906-1:** My bestie Rachel was always there for me though. Insisting he would like me as I am. But one day, and I'll never forget this- she comes to me and goes, 'you are not enough.' That was really jarring to me because she had always been supportive of me before. I ask her what gives and she goes, 'you are not enough. You've tried so hard to be enough, but you aren't. You're not pretty enough, not skinny enough, not girly enough. I wasn't either. But I have something that can help you.' In hindsight, I should've seen it coming. She had started acting differently. Dressing differently. And I think the whole time, I was jealous of her. I'm not sure why she didn't come forward and say something sooner, but it changed my life when she did. After JGT, Ron started to notice me. I started dressing better, sewing, but most of all- [baking](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/ella-s-sickly-sweets). Eventually, I started giving my treats to Ron, who loved them! I always loved baking before, maybe that's why I was so fat. But JGT was able to help me bake in a healthier way!
_Pictures of SCP-7906-1 in a younger form flash across the screen_.
**SCP-7906-1:** I was so… insecure back then. But I love myself more than ever now! I could never even imagine being sad thanks to all the help from my girlies at JGT! Especially my bestie Rachel, who introduced me in the first place, starting the chain of good decisions that led me to my husband! He just loves when I bake, how I dress, who I am- everything. I wouldn't have my life without him. Without her. But we're going to skip to the decoration!
_The screen now shows plain heart-shaped cookies on a plate. SCP-7906-1 is seen holding a container of frosting in one hand, and a knife in the other._
**SCP-7906-1:** First you frost your cookies- duh! I'm using white frosting, but pink or red works too!
_SCP-7906-1 begins to frost one of the cookies. After it completes frosting all the cookies on the plate, it picks up a container of sprinkles._
**SCP-7906-1:** Pink, rainbow, red, it's up to you what you want to do! Do what you want!
_SCP-7906-1 giggles, beginning to apply sprinkles to its cookies._
**SCP-7906-1:** And we're finished! Looks perfect! Your boyfriend or husband and besties will absolutely adore these cookies! Remember to follow the recipe and try it yourself!
_SCP-7906 makes a heart shape with its hands._

[![spring](https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--resized-images/scp-7906/spring/medium.jpg)](https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-7906/spring)
A still from '♡Cutest spring pastries-JGT♡'
**Video Title:** ♡Cutest spring pastries-JGT♡
_SCP-7906-1's opener plays. Clips of SCP-7906-1 baking and cooking flash across the screen while music plays._
_SCP-7906 is standing in a pink-themed kitchen with spring decorations._
**SCP-7906-1:** Hello my besties! It's Monica here! And it's finally spring! Flowers are in bloom, colors are brighter, things are better! And what better way to celebrate spring than baking some flower-themed pastries to celebrate?
_A title card flashes across the screen stating ‘Cutest spring pastries’. The camera now shows SCP-7906-1 again. SCP-7906-1 picks up a plate with flower-shaped pastries._
**SCP-7906-1:** Now these babies are absolutely delicious! Mine are soft sugar cookie dough based with strawberries baked in and strawberry icing. But yours can have any or no fruit baking in with any flavored frosting!
_The screen switches to show a kitchen countertop with an array of ingredients laid out._
**SCP-7906-1:** First, I'm going to show you how to make these delicious pastries! Then while they're baking, we can chat a bit!
_Most of the video is SCP-7906-1 showing ingredients and baking. It has been summarized for simplicity._
**SCP-7906-1:** And now you put them in the oven, and we wait!
_SCP-7906-1 is seen placing a tray into the oven. The screen then cuts to SCP-7906 sitting at an outside table._
**SCP-7906-1:** These bake for a while, so we've got a bit to chat! You know, the first thing I ever baked was in Spring. I was 15, still in high school. I wanted something to impress Ron, but I wasn't sure what to do. At some point, Rachel suggested baking! I told her there was no way I'd be any good at it, but she insisted, so I tried it!
_SCP-7906-1 takes a sip from a glass of milk._
**SCP-7906-1:** Rachel taste-tested all of my desserts. I had her start doing it more after I joined JGT! She was more willing at that time anyway, she loved them because JGT had made her appreciate desserts more! I was afraid to get into baking so much because you know, I didn't want to be a fat pig! Then Rachel has the idea for me to do fat-free options! I started giving Rachel my desserts more after that. I mean she definitely needed them. That girl had the nerve to tell me _I_ was overweight. She had so much fat in her hips. She joked about how I was a bitch for constantly criticizing her, L-O-L.
_SCP-7906-1 sets down the glass of milk it was holding._
**SCP-7906-1:** Over time, she started to eat my treats less. Which really hurt my feelings! I would even make ones specifically for her! When I asked her why, she said it was because she didn't feel like it. That all the sugar was making her sick. Can you believe that? They're fat-free!
_SCP-7906-1 scoffs._
**SCP-7906-1:** Eventually, after some convincing she said she was willing to eat them again. Which was great! She continued to taste-test my recipes for the longest time. As she ate them, I continued to get happier and happier! That's the type of best friend you should be. Supporting each other!
_The screen changes to show undecorated pastries with a bowl of frosting next to them._
**SCP-7906-1:** And now we decorate!
_SCP-7906 demonstrates to the audience how to decorate the pastries. The screen cuts to the pastries, milk, and two flower pots set up on a table outside._
**SCP-7906-1:** And then you put it on a nice setup! There we are! The perfect flower pastries for spring! Don't forget to share them with all your besties and loved ones! Like, share, and subscribe! And don't forget that you can check out all my recipes on www.justgirlythings.si!

[![summer](https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--resized-images/scp-7906/summer/medium.jpg)](https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-7906/summer)
A still from '♡PERFECT summer lemonade!- JGT♡'.
**Video Title:** ♡PERFECT summer lemonade!- JGT♡
_SCP-7906-1's opener plays. Clips of SCP-7906-1 baking and cooking flash across the screen while music plays._
_SCP-7906-1 is sitting on a picnic blanket outside in the sun._
**SCP-7906-1:** Hello my lovely girls! Monica back again with another video! Can you believe it's summer already? I certainly can't! I feel like it was just winter! It's so bright and beautiful outside! Spring passed right by! We need something to celebrate summer, and what better to celebrate summer than lemonade? So today, we're going to make some strawberry-orange-flavored lemonade! It's my very favorite, and I'm sure it'll be your favorite as well!
_A title card flashed across the screen stating ‘Perfect summer lemonade.’ The screen shows an outdoor table with a pitcher, a glass, water, and other supplies to make lemonade on it. SCP-7906 explains what ingredients are needed before beginning to show itself making the lemonade._
**SCP-7906-1:** So this lemonade is a relatively easy make! Don't use the processed stuff, that's too much sugar! We want to stay fit ladies! I know my Ron wants me in shape. Remember how I said he wouldn't talk to me before I was skinny?
_SCP-7906-1 continues to show itself making the drink until it is finished._
**SCP-7906-1:** And there we are! Let's try it!
_SCP-7906-1 takes a sip from the glass of lemonade._
**SCP-7906-1:** Delicious! Now that's finished, I have a few concerns to address from my last video. Mary says she gave the cupcakes to her best friend, who then began to feel depressed. She said that was weird because she expected them to make her happy! She gave her even more of them, which just made her even more depressed!
_SCP-7906-1 frowns._
**SCP-7906-1:** I want to clarify that how my desserts and food make you feel is up to you, not me. Why is that my responsibility? I'm happy now. You should be too. And if you aren't, that's your problem.
_SCP-7906-1 gives a wide smile._
**SCP-7906-1:** Thank you so much for watching! Make sure to like and subscribe! And as always, my recipes are available at www.justgirlythings.si!

_SCP-7906-1 is sitting at a table with pink fall-themed decorations._
**SCP-7906-1:** Hello besties! Monica here! It's fall now, the very best time of the year! You can wear cute sweaters, watch the leaves fall, the likes! Me and Rachel loved to watch the leaves fall when we were younger.
_Pictures of SCP-7906-1 and Rachel outside watching leaves flash across the screen._
**SCP-7906-1:** Slowly, she stopped doing it though. She started staying inside more, which is totally silly! I always brought her my desserts to cheer her up from her sad feelings! Not sure if it worked though haha. But let's get started! Today I have for you a wonderful fall bowl cake!
_A title card flashes across the screen stating ‘Fall bowl cake’. Most of the video is SCP-7906-1 showing ingredients and baking. It has been summarized for simplicity._
**SCP-7906-1:** And then you finish it off with a cute decoration! You can make this cake any time of the year, but to me, fall is the perfect time!
_SCP-7906-1 begins to cut a piece of cake._
**SCP-7906-1:** Some of you have been asking about Rachel, if she can make appearances! Unfortunately, Rachel isn't available. You'll probably never see her on this channel. But I know she would want you to keep watching my videos!
_The screen now shows SCP-7906-1. SCP-7906-1 is holding a plate of cake._

A still from '♡Perfect Girly Hot Chocolate for my best friend!♡'.
**Video Title:** ♡Perfect Girly Hot Chocolate for my best friend! JGT♡
_SCP-7906-1's opener plays. Clips of SCP-7906-1 baking and cooking flash across the screen while music plays. SCP-7906-1 is sitting in a pink-themed kitchen with pink Christmas decorations._
**SCP-7906-1:** Merry Christmas and happy holidays everyone! Monica is here to bring you another great video! I know this video may be nearby Christmas and about hot chocolate, but it’s actually not a Christmas video- it’s a birthday video! Not for me of course, you all know my birthday is in November. This is a birthday video for my bestie Rachel! But I should probably be more clear. Rachel is… no longer with us.
_Pictures of SCP-7906-1 and Rachel flash across the screen._
**SCP-7906-1:** About eight months ago, Rachel took her own life. I know that’s a little dark, but we’re here to celebrate her life for her birthday! Hot chocolate was always Rachel’s favorite, so that’s why I’m making this in remembrance. I think we all need to be more aware of mental health. Just remember that if you’re struggling girls, JGT will help you. It always has for me.
_A title card flashes across the screen stating ‘Perfect girly hot chocolate for my best friend’. SCP-7906-1 begins to pull out ingredients to make hot chocolate._
**SCP-7906-1:** So I can talk, I’m going to put the instructions on the screen! But let’s get started!
_SCP-7906-1 begins to prepare the recipe._
**SCP-7906-1:** Rachel was… my best friend. She helped me through my darkest times. And I helped her through hers. Though clearly not enough because she’s not here anymore. But that’s not my fault, it’s hers. She had JGT. She was the one that got me into JGT. And then she had the audacity to start acting like a pussy.
_SCP-7906-1 scoffs._
**SCP-7906-1:** “You don’t understand my feelings!” Um, yes I did. I understood what she needed better than anything. What she needed was me. My desserts make me happier. If they couldn’t make her happier, then that’s her fault! What, little Rachel couldn’t take a little sugar? She was always a fatty.
_SCP-7906-1 laughs._
**SCP-7906-1:** She always made things about her. Ridiculous, right? Maybe she wouldn’t have died alone if she had followed in my footsteps. No boy is going to want some insane girl that can’t even brush her hair properly, L-O-L. But nonetheless, I love Rachel. Even if she was… well… the way she was. Rachel could’ve used more help. She should’ve just listened to KeeLee’s teachings. I always did, and it worked fine. Rachel was like “this is your doing, you always make everything about you” or whatever. Can you believe that? I’m happy, so it’s fine. I don’t understand why she couldn’t just be happy for me. If she didn’t want to help herself, then that’s up to her.
_SCP-7906-1 remains silent until it finishes the recipe._
**SCP-7906-1:** And there we are! Perfect girly chocolate you can make for your best friend! I know Rachel would enjoy it.
_SCP-7906-1 smiles, staring directly at the camera._
I know you can hear me, Rachel. Isn’t it nice that I’m doing something for you, even after you took the coward’s way out?
_SCP-7906-1 looks at the camera with a smile._
**SCP-7906-1:** Don’t forget to like and subscribe! And of course, remake this recipe for your best friends! Maybe they’ll be more grateful than mine was.
