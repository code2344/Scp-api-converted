SCP-6598.
**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-6598 is contained in a coin case in Site-322's low-security item vault. Testing of SCP-6598 was overseen by Researcher H. Hartwell and Dr. J. Dune.
**Description:** SCP-6598 is an American quarter dated to 1983. When a subject makes a verbal statement and then flips SCP-6598, the object will land on a face corresponding to the statement's relation to objective fact. A result of "heads" denotes the truth, and "tails" denotes a falsehood. Questions and statements that are not yes-or-no questions will not lead to answers from SCP-6598. The accuracy of the statements presented by SCP-6598 is presently under investigation.
**Addendum 6598.1:** Experiment log
Statement | Result  
---|---  
Grass is green. (Dune) | Heads.  
SCP-6598 understands what I'm saying. (Dune) | Heads.  
SCP-6598 is having a good day today. (Hartwell) | Tails. _Note: SCP-6598 was noted to have landed with unusual force._  
The first number of the winning lottery numbers for tomorrow is 1. (Hartwell) | Tails.  
_[25 tests omitted]_  
The final number of the winning lottery numbers for tomorrow is 7. (Hartwell) | Heads. _Winnings seized. Using anomalies for further personal gain will lead to disciplinary action — Dir. Paul Lague_  
Dr. Dune ate a sandwich for lunch this afternoon. (Hartwell) | Heads. _Thing’s a smartass. A hot dog is not a sandwich — J. Dune_  
Extraterrerestial life exists. (Dune) | Tails. The test was repeated with several variations of the question, specifying life in the entire universe, etc. Result remained tails.  
Baseball is a boring sport. (Hartwell) | SCP-6598 flipped itself between heads and tails until the next statement was made.  
_Star Wars: Episode 8: The Last Jedi_ is a bad film. (Hartwell) | Same result as in the previous test. Upon repetition of the statement, SCP-6598 drastically increased in temperature to the point where it could not be safely handled. It returned to baseline temperature after fifteen minutes.  
SCP-6598 likes Dr. Dune more than Researcher Hartwell. (Dune) | Same result as in the previous test. Hesitation was observed in SCP-6598 every time it flipped to its heads side.  
God can create a burrito so hot that he can't eat it. (Hartwell) | SCP-6598 burned Researcher Hartwell's hand.  
SCP-6598 dislikes paradoxes. (Hartwell) | Heads. Considerable force was observed upon its landing, enough to dent the testing table.  
SCP-6598 enjoys being flipped. (Hartwell) | Tails. Same result as in the previous test. SCP-6598 managed to punch though the table upon its landing.  
SCP-6598 will breach containment in the future. (Hartwell) | Heads.  
[SCP-682](/scp-682) is indestructible. (Hartwell) | Tails. _Researcher Hartwell's lottery winnings have been budgeted for further decommissioning tests — Dir. Paul Lague_  
[Site-5](/scp-4182) does not exist. (Dune) | Heads. Following the repetition of this test, SCP-6598 reversed its decision. Subsequent tests have not delivered conclusive results.  
I will be with my girlfriend in five years. (Hartwell) | Tails.  
Everything dies. (Hartwell) | Heads. The Department of Tactical Theology immediately called a symposium to discuss the ramifications of this result.  
I will die in the next ten years. (Hartwell) | Heads.  
SCP-6598 is upset with me. (Hartwell) | SCP-6598 hung stationary in the air. It began to violently vibrate before accelerating to approximately 1100 km/h and exiting Site-322 through Researcher Hartwell's skull (with a minor course correction to avoid striking Dr. Dune).  
SCP-6598 was recovered in an empty parking lot approximately 30 kilometers from Site-322, laying on its head side. A small impact crater was observed in the asphalt surrounding it. Following the final test, SCP-6598 has remained facing heads up, despite all attempts to rotate it or supply additional prompts. Testing halted.
