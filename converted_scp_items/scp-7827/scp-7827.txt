Item #:

 SCP-7827

Object Class:

 Safe

Special Containment Procedures:

 SCP-7827 is held within a high-security locker at site-19.

Only Level 4+ personnel can authorize experimentation.

Description:

 SCP-7827 refers to a set of earrings manufactured by JCPenney in 2013. SCP-7827 is composed of circular sapphires, set inside of copper lining.

When a human female applies SCP-7827 to their earlobes, SCP-7827 will forcefully adhere itself to them and is unable to be removed through traditional means. Shortly after, the individual will enter a delirium where they are effectively paralyzed.

After 3 minutes of contact with the earlobe, copper wiring will begin stemming from the object’s base. It will then navigate towards the subjects brain via ear canal at a speed of 12cm/min. If successful, SCP-7827 will began lacerating the occipital lobe, which leads to the victim's death. Once expired, SCP-7827 will swiftly return its wiring before ejecting itself towards the ground, where it will remain inactive.

Addendum:

 SCP-7827 was initially recovered inside a residential apartment belonging to Beverly Rodriguez in Phoenix, Arizona. Beverly’s remains were discovered contorted on her living room floor, where a field agent discovered SCP-7827 laying nearby.

Following SCP-7827 containment, Beverly’s phone revealed a series of text messages exchanged with Mason Dewitt, Beverly’s ex boyfriend. The following are the excerpts most relevant.

Hey mason

waddup bee

Listen. I don’t really think I’m in a situation where I can continue this relationship. It has nothing to do with you, you’re a great guy. im just caught up in a lot of stuff atm and I don’t think I can healthily maintain a relationship. I hope we can stay friends after this.

ur joking right

????

what happened? Fuck somebody else or do you hate yourself so much you refuse to let yourself be happy? we have so much in common, this really feels like a half assed excuse to go whore around without consequence

I really hope we can stay friends. Maybe after you cool down we can discuss this like adults

im sorry but you don’t have a fucking clue how much I sacrificed in our relationship. I sold my laptop to pay for your stencils so you can keep making ur shitty ass drawing lmaoo

youre such a fucking leach. Enjoy living life on your 0$ an hour salary

Hey bee. Got a minute?

what

fym “what” LOL

We haven’t talked in awhile and I want to get back in touch again.

well

You said some very hurtful things last time we spoke. Ik what i did was out of the blue but I saw a side to you I haven’t seen before. I really cherished our friendship and to hear you speaking to me like that made me think there was no chance of rekindling it.

I understand we’re probably never gonna have that level of intimacy again but I’d want to maintain our friendship. what do you say?

I’d like that a lot
