Photograph of SCP-8770, taken on initial discovery.
  
**Special Containment Procedures:** Satellite data is to be altered to hide the presence of SCP-8770. Ship traffic is diverted from the area via the placement of several isolated danger buoys around the perimeter and anchored to the anomaly. These are to be checked by a Foundation team on a monthly basis to ensure that their placement has not shifted. 
In the event that a buoy's placement has shifted, a diving team is to be dispatched and SCP-8770 is to be monitored for changes in its geometry, the buoys then adjusted accordingly to these shifts.
Otherwise, the anomaly is to be left abandoned.
SCP-8770 is not to be inhabited.
**Description:** SCP-8770 is a vessel in a state of irregular structural flux, located upon the sea floor of the Atlantic Ocean at ██°██'███.█''N, -██°██'██.█''W. The exterior of the anomaly most frequently resembles that of a man-made, sunken vessel roughly 355 meters in length on average.
While external changes of SCP-8770 occur at seemingly random intervals, notable or consistent shifts have included:
  * Changes in materials that make up outer structures — metal into wood, wood into metal, instances of stone, fabric or glass
  * Occurrences of new walls, suggestions of the creation of additional internal rooms
  * Large junctions of metal beams jutting downwards towards the sea floor
  * Indistinct railings along top portions or formed balconies
  * Steering apparatuses resembling those found on ships of inconsistent age
  * Nonsensical directional signs
  * Engine structures and propellers consistent with that of motorized boats and submarines
  * Wires
  * Roofs and sidings resembling those of residential homes
  * Windows resembling those of residential homes
  * Doors resembling those of residential homes

An exterior portion of SCP-8770, showing an entryway.
All structures are often in states of high decay and water damage. The undersea area around SCP-8770 is almost a complete ecological dead zone, devoid of all marine life, with the exception of some corals that have grown on the structure of the anomaly.
During initial analysis, it was discovered that SCP-8770 exerts a minor memetic influence on its surroundings — increasing feelings of unease and discomfort in those that are within 5 meters of its exterior.
All attempts to access the interior of SCP-8770 via unmanned submersibles have resulted in the complete cessation of all technological functions upon entry. Approximately three submersibles were lost before the prospect of a manned investigation was proposed and subsequentially approved.
**Addendum 8770:** The first four manned expeditions into SCP-8770 were undergone to determine the internal dimensions of SCP-8770's interior. Teams were instructed to remain on the outskirts, staying along the exterior wall as much as possible. Over the course of these explorations, the following was noted:
  * Interior was notably clear of any water damage that is expected of a structure of its nature
  * The appearances and disappearances of hallways, doors and windows at random
  * SCP-8770's interior dimensions have been recorded differently each perimeter expedition
  * SCP-8770's interior does not match the dimensions of its exterior, in spite of exterior shifts

The fifth expedition was an attempt to discover the center of SCP-8770.
**Exploration Log 8770.5:**
**Foreword:** Three members of MTF Gamma-6 ("Deep Feeders") — codenamed BLACK CARPET, NINGEN and MATAGI CARCASS — were deployed to find the center of SCP-8770.
To determine if SCP-8770's memetic properties intensify by internal proximity, the heart rate of all present individuals were monitored and recorded.
* * *
**COMMAND:** _Gamma-6, do you read?_
**MATAGI CARCASS:** Copy that, Command.
**[MATAGI CARCASS' BPM IS STABLE]**
**BLACK CARPET:** Loud and clear.
**[BLACK CARPET'S BPM IS STABLE]**
**NINGEN:** We read.
**[NINGEN'S BPM IS STABLE]**
**COMMAND:** _Good. Proceed into SCP-8770._
_The team approaches the top portion of SCP-8770. This section has the appearance of the upper deck of a commercial fishing ship. There are broken posts and rotted barrels. Two paddle wheels emerge from parts of the hull, their bottom-halves seemingly fused into the rusted metal. These antiquated pieces appear out of time and place._
_SCP-8770 visibly stretches on for rough 30 meters in all directions, the rest of the anomaly obscured by the water’s turbidity — leaving only distant, towering silhouettes and shadows against the blue._
_The water is still, devoid of movement and life aside from Gamma-6 as they draw closer. Their swimming stirs bursts of dust and debris when they level with the deck._

From the body cam of BLACK CARPET
**NINGEN:** There's an opening in the floor of the hull up ahead. Should make for easy entry.
**MATAGI CARCASS:** I see it too.
_The three swim to the gap in the hull. There is a ladder covered in algae and barnacles that descends into the space. The team swims inside._
_The interior appears like that of a standard submersible, though in the growing absence of sunlight all three members of Gamma-6 turn on their headlights. The three's respirators are the only sounds detected._
_NINGEN takes a roll of reflective, waterproof tape and wraps a strip around one of the rungs of the ladder._
**NINGEN:** I'll use these to keep track of where we're going. This place is a labyrinth.
**BLACK CARPET:** Good thinking. _[She pauses]_ Let's hope there isn't a minotaur.
_There's a quiet laugh amongst the team._
**MATAGI CARCASS:** You sure that’s gonna work, though? The interior of this place seems to shuffle around.
**NINGEN:** Hopefully, when it shuffles, there’s a rhyme-and-reason to it. If we find our markings, they may still lead us back — especially with one right by the exit.
_NINGEN pats the ladder, the orange tape now fastened to the rung._
**BLACK CARPET:** It’s also better than nothing at all.
_MATAGI CARCASS nods._
**MATAGI CARCASS:** You think there's something in here they want us to find?
**BLACK CARPET:** Since the other teams found squat on the outskirts, they wanna see if there's a center to this thing. They just wanna know if it _has_ one, y’know? A source. Not like there's any actual traces of life around this thing, anything that's mobile seems to avoid it like the plague.
**MATAGI CARCASS:** _[She nods again]_ Well, that's good for us I'd reckon.
_NINGEN cuts the tape, and pulls away. BLACK CARPET has since pulled out a heavy duty compass._
**NINGEN:** Alright, let's get moving.
_The other two nod, and follow him as he begins to swim down the corridor. The visibility is considerably low, only allowing sight roughly a meter ahead. After approximately ten seconds of swimming, a hatch is seen at the end of the hall._
**MATAGI CARCASS:** …it's like a warship's hall in here, all untouched.
**NINGEN:** I'll open the hatch.
_NINGEN goes to reach wheel handle, only for it to turn before he can grasp it. There's a loud hissing heard as NINGEN gasps through his respirator._
**[NINGEN'S BPM HAS RAISED]**
**NINGEN:** The hell—?
_The hatch wheel turns in a full circle, before the hatch itself slowly opens inwards without being_ _touched.   
MATAGI CARCASS and BLACK CARPET come to a stop behind NINGEN._
**BLACK CARPET:** …I feel a current.
**MATAGI CARCASS:** Me too.
**NINGEN:** Command? Door just opened itself.
**COMMAND:** _Noted. Keep going, but be on alert._
_Through the hatch is an open room._
_A living room._
_Several pieces of furniture are situated around the space, all facing an inactive television. A coffee table with a few coasters and an empty glass upon it. The floor is carpeted. A bookshelf is situated against the far wall. BLACK CARPET approaches it._
**MATAGI CARCASS:** _[She swims to the center of the room, and turns in a small circle]_ It's… not rotted. No coral, no rust — nothing. So at least it’s… consistent?
**NINGEN:** Yet the outside looks like it's been underwater for decades. _[He brushes a hand along the carpet, it stirs no debris]_ Hm.
_There is a pause of silence amongst the team._
**MATAGI CARCASS:** You think that lamp over there would be a good place to tape?
**NINGEN:** Yeah, I'd reckon so.
_NINGEN glances back at the hatch. It is still open. He swims over to a lamp that sits in the corner and begins to wind the reflective tape around it._

**[NINGEN'S BPM HAS STABLIZED]**
**[BLACK CARPET'S BPM HAS RAISED]**
**BLACK CARPET:** Someone come look at this so I know my eyes aren't playing tricks on me.
_MATAGI CARCASS and NINGEN turn to her. NINGEN approaches._
_BLACK CARPET is holding one of the books from the shelf. Despite being within the water, it is undamaged and unaffected. She turns to show it to NINGEN._
_Random assortments of words and letters fill the pages without rhyme or reason. Some are shown to be blank when BLACK CARPET begins to page through._
**NINGEN:** Yeah, yeah no you're seeing that right. It's all… _[He traces a finger along the page]_ gibberish.
**BLACK CARPET:** They're all like this.
_MATAGI CARCASS turns to the rest of the room. On the far side, past the couch and lamp, is the open entryway to a kitchen. She swims inside to investigate._
_Within is a dining table, four seats situated around it. Like the living room, the place is untouched by rot, rust or any other signs of water damage. Upon the table are placemats, plates, silverware — all organized and laid out. Empty cups. A set of cupboards line the one wall above a counter with an inlaid sink. Along the same wall rests a fridge and an oven, the wires from the fridge are spread out all over the floor. None of them seem to be live._
_NINGEN and BLACK CARPET enter the kitchen as well._
**NINGEN:** It's like… everybody up and left. Table's set for dinner and everything.
**BLACK CARPET:** Are there any actual signs of this place ever being inhabited?
_MATAGI CARCASS opens one of the cupboards. It is empty. She opens another. It is empty. She opens the fridge, and it too is empty. The light inside it does not turn on._
**MATAGI CARCASS:** …I don't think so. All empty.
_NINGEN's respirator hisses as he exhales._
**NINGEN:** Command? We've found an empty living room and kitchen. No sign of any past habitation or life.
**COMMAND:** _Affirmative. Are there any other paths?_
_BLACK CARPET is experimentally turning the knobs on the oven. The one burner begins to glow a soft red when she turns it up. Swiftly, she turns it back off — than glances over her shoulder at NINGEN._
**BLACK CARPET:** I saw another hall past the bookshelf.
**NINGEN:** We'll head there.
**COMMAND:** _Very well. Proceed._
_The team exits the kitchen as a group, and BLACK CARPET leads the way._
_At the end of the hall is a child's bedroom._
_Like the living room, its interior conditions are pristine in spite of its sunken nature. There's a small bed against the far wall, a nightstand by its side. A bureau is a few meters away, with a lamp resting upon it. Everything is untouched, undamaged, unscathed. The walls appear to be pale, but the exact color is difficult to discern due to the water._
_MATAGI CARCASS finds the interior of the bureau to be filled with children's clothes. Unworn. She swiftly closes the drawer to keep them from floating upwards._
_A teddy bear is suspended at the ceiling, back facing the floor._
_NINGEN swims up to retrieve it. He turns the bear in his hands to examine its front._
_It's face and front is covered in mold and rot. Festering, dark splotches. Bits of coral._
_He releases it with a hiss of his respirator._
**[NINGEN'S BPM HAS RAISED]**
**[BLACK CARPET'S BPM HAS RAISED]**
**[MATAGI CARCASS' BPM HAS RAISED]**
**NINGEN:** Jesus—!
**MATAGI CARCASS:** NINGEN, the hell—?
**NINGEN:** Well— fuck. Found our first trace of — of water damage inside this thing.
_BLACK CARPET swims over, and takes the bear. She examines it._
**BLACK CARPET:** Sure is… this was up against the ceiling, right?
**NINGEN:** Yeah— yeah it was.
_MATAGI CARCASS swims upwards and puts her hand against the ceiling. She tries to push against it, test it for any weakness or damage, but it does not give._
**MATAGI CARCASS:** …still pretty solid up here. The ceiling itself doesn't seem to be damaged.
**NINGEN:** …huh. I wonder why that thing's like that, then.
**MATAGI CARCASS:** Hell if I know — but it may mean something.
_As MATAGI CARCASS pauses to think, BLACK CARPET turns her attention down to the bear in her hands._
**BLACK CARPET:** I'm gonna leave this in here, we can bring it back with us on the swing back to see if it's… got anything specifically weird about it.
**NINGEN:** Sounds good.
_She releases it. It floats back up to the ceiling. Its rotted face now stares down at the floor._
_The team quietly swims out of the room._
_There is a new door on the left hall. It is ajar._
**BLACK CARPET:** Ah.
**NINGEN:** Well, that’s the first structural shift we’ve seen while in here.
**BLACK CARPET:** Not uncharacteristic of the anomaly, but good to note.
**MATAGI CARCASS:** It's a way forward, is it not?
_There is a moment of silence, before NINGEN relays the door's appearance to COMMAND._
**COMMAND:** _Proceed deeper._
**NINGEN:** Very well.
_They enter through the door after NINGEN marks the handle with tape, and begin traveling down the new hallway. Extraneous exchanges over the next hour and a half have been removed for brevity._
_Over the course of this time, the team passes forty-four bedrooms, eighteen kitchens, twenty-six bathrooms, and fourteen living rooms. The furniture within range wildly in time period, mixes of modern and ranging previous centuries with little consistency._
_Periodically, they leave indication of their path via fluorescent tape._
_As they progress through hallway after hallway — it is noted by the team that water damage and rust has become noticeable in places. There are holes in some walls, piping visible within. Discordant rods of metal, scattered instances of rotted wood or furniture against otherwise pristine pieces._
_The team stops for a brief break within the fifteenth living room, having to have opened a ship hatch to enter it. The hatch is left ajar behind them. There is a window on the far wall of the room. NINGEN shifts to check the levels of oxygen within their tanks._
_BLACK CARPET holds up the compass and glances at the window. It indicates that she is facing south. Theoretically, this window's placement is impossible in relation to the rest of SCP-8770._
_Beyond it is an expanse of water. BLACK CARPET's light illuminates off a massive tangle of wires and pipes in the distance. There are unclear silhouettes past it all that appear to be moving. The body camera footage shows only blurs. There is a faint current emanating._
**[BLACK CARPET'S BPM HAS RAISED]**
_MATAGI CARCASS is instead examining the walls of the connecting halls, glancing around at the rooms._
**MATAGI CARCASS:** It almost feels… deliberate.
**NINGEN:** Deliberate?
**MATAGI CARCASS:** It's been on my mind since the first room. This all feels like it's… like all this has been set up for something.
_BLACK CARPET turns away from the window._
**BLACK CARPET:** Or someone.
**MATAGI CARCASS:** …yeah.
**BLACK CARPET:** Maybe it was _supposed_ to be, but I don't think it is anymore.
_BLACK CARPET turns back to the window. It is gone._
**BLACK CARPET:** Like when the landlord paints the walls to hide the wood rot.
_She traces the now-wall with one hand, glove sliding over the water-damaged metal and dry-wall. Flecks of rust float off into the water._
**NINGEN:** You reckon we're… diving past those cover-ups, then?
**BLACK CARPET:** _[She nods]_ Peeling back the paint.
**MATAGI CARCASS:** If we keep going, maybe we'll find what this thing truly is then. Dive past the walls, find the heart — yeah?
_The team nods. NINGEN informs COMMAND of the plan to continue deeper after ten minutes of rest._
**COMMAND:** _Your oxygen tanks contain enough air for roughly five more hours. Be safe._
_MTF Gamma-6 proceeds forward. In spots, the wall paper has entirely peeled away — revealing metal and wires, wooden planks._

_30 minutes of travel passes._
_At the 31st minute, MATAGI CARCASS notices that one of the rotted boards along the floor is shifting. She reaches downwards and lifts it._
_Under the floorboards is a fish. Wrapped in wire and cables. It is impaled on piping._
_No. Not impaled. There is no sharp point nor end to the pipe. It stretches onwards, as though it had wound itself through the fish. There is no way it could have been impaled._
_It is still alive._
_Its gills flutter against its twitching sides, its eye is glassy and infested. Its whole body is infested. Defunct electrical wiring weaves through its flesh and scales and holds it tight. Its fins have melted into the rotted wood._
_It lives here. It lives here._
_It loves it here._  

**[MATAGI CARCASS’ BPM HAS RAISED SIGNIFICANTLY]**
**MATAGI CARCASS:** Command, are you— are you seeing this?
**COMMAND:** _Affirmative._
_There is a pause._
**NINGEN:** We… we should keep moving —
_She returns the floorboard. Returns the squirming thing to its_ _Heaven._
**COMMAND:** A shipwreck is a type of corpse.  
  
**MATAGI CARCASS:** …sounds like a plan.
_The team continues._
**[MATAGI CARCASS' BPM IS RAISED]**

**[NINGEN'S BPM HAS IS RAISED]**
_The halls have widened, the team is able to swim side by side. The wallpaper is_ _beautiful. There are flowers painted on them, little yellow ones. It is falling apart. The ceiling has raised upwards, now being roughly ten feet above the team._
_The team enters a massive,_ _open room. Pillars stretch up to the ceiling. The floor is polished stone. It is like an entryway to something grand. Dancing patterns are across the walls in bright and lively colors._  

**NINGEN:** The hell's that sound?
**BLACK CARPET:** Beats me, visibility's shit in here.
**MATAGI CARCASS:** All the pipes, I think— I've got a stronger light, hold on. _[MATAGI CARCASS unclips a heavy duty lamp from her hip, activates it and raises it.]_
_NINGEN places another piece of tape at the doorway they came through. He stares down at the floorboards as they shift._

_They are able to scan and travel through the room easier with the added light. Gamma-6 begins to continue onwards. There is a loud humming in the air, vibrating the water._ _The walls are singing._  

**BLACK CARPET:** Watch the wires, can't tell if they're live or not. This whole place has been inconsistent with what does and doesn't have juice in it.
It's safe.  

**MATAGI CARCASS:** Will do. It's a bit of a tangled mess in here.
_The room is expansive. Open. The team individually squeezes past a trio of pipes, brushing rust and coral into the water._
**NINGEN:** This is starting to look more like a ship than a house. It's like if a submarine's engine room exploded.
![5120096962_71e0ec35c3_4k.jpg](https://live.staticflickr.com/4067/5120096962_71e0ec35c3_4k.jpg)
SCP-8770 is devoid of life.
**MATAGI CARCASS:** With how much noise shit in here is making, I wonder if it _is_ an engine room.
_The team maneuver past further tangles of wire and pipes. NINGEN catches a glimpse of two fish_ _swimming and playing amongst the halls._  

_A circular structure laid into the ceiling above rotates within a rusted steel frame. Beyond it, a large fan with metal blades spins. The volume of the structure, combined with present noises from an unknown source, drown out anything said by MTF Gamma-6. MATAGI CARCASS is seen putting a hand against the side of her head._
_The team eventually locates a hatch within the room, and pull it open. They enter a hallway, and a sixteenth living room._ _It's better here. It is quiet. It is free of the rot and the pain. It hurts less here. I'm sorry._  

_They proceed to travel down the halls for roughly ten more minutes, finding additional bedrooms and living spaces. They are heavily damaged, and fallen pieces of furniture strewn about. A door hangs on rotted hinges._
**MATAGI CARCASS:** Hey, NINGEN? What's the status on our tanks right now?
_NINGEN shifts to check._
**NINGEN:** Four hours.
_MATAGI CARCASS and BLACK CARPET turn to face him._
**BLACK CARPET:** …hmm, took about a bit over two hours to get here. I think it may be wise and play it safe here and turn back.
**NINGEN:** _[He nods]_ COMMAND, we're starting to get low in here — shall we turn back and leave the anomaly? Come back another day with more tanks?
**COMMAND:** Do you know how it feels to fall apart? To rot?
It hurts. It aches. I can feel the sea water eating me more and more as seconds — minutes — days — years pass by. Decades. Decades pass by. It corrodes. It burns. The cold waters do not save me.
**MATAGI CARCASS:** Copy that, Command. We'll start to head out.
_The team turns to swim back the way they came. They turn the corner. They reach the end of the hall._
_The hatch is gone._
**[MATAGI CARCASS' BPM HAS RAISED SIGNIFICANTLY]**
**[BLACK CARPET'S BPM HAS RAISED SIGNIFICANTLY]**
**[NINGEN'S BPM HAS RAISED SIGNIFICANTLY]**
**NINGEN:** You've gotta be fucking kidding me.
_NINGEN brings his hand to the wall. It is rusted metal, bits of coral are grown onto it. It is a solid, single piece. It looks as though it has not been touched in decades._
_Gamma-6 spends roughly 10 minutes attempting to use an underwater reciprocating saw to cut through the wall. They are unsuccessful. The saw is unable to pierce deep enough into the metal._
**MATAGI CARCASS:** There were other halls — other paths we didn't take. Maybe something loops back around? There's gotta be another way, right?
_NINGEN's hands are shaking._
**COMMAND:** _What's happening?_
**BLACK CARPET:** Previous entryway has vanished. We're going to have to locate a new route back.  
  
**It's going to be ok.**
**COMMAND:** _Affirmative. We wish you luck, be careful team._
_BLACK CARPET turns to the others._
**BLACK CARPET:** Steady breaths — we can't go burning through our oxygen. We have around 4 hours still. Let's try some of the other halls. _[She gestures behind her, to the other sprawling rooms and halls.]_
**Come inside.**
**MATAGI CARCASS:** Right, right. Yeah — _[She shakes her head, and begins to swim.]_  

**Please.**
_NINGEN keeps his hand braced on the wall for a few more moments, before exhaling and pushing off — swimming behind the other two. With the angle of the floor, they appear to be descending deeper_
_Extraneous footage has been removed._
_Gamma-6 spends 30 minutes searching for an exit._ _**They will find that it is beautiful. The doors are long sealed shut.**_
_Gamma-6 spends 2 hours searching for an exit._
**NINGEN:** This isn't working — we aren't finding _anything._ Christ— I can barely see.
**MATAGI CARCASS:** We can't just give up— we can't—
**BLACK CARPET:** We're not giving up. Come on—  
  

  

**There are so many rooms. They're for you.**
**To stay.**
  

  

**NINGEN:** Don't fucking kid yourself — we're going to run out of oxygen, Avery. We're deeper than before and we have barely two hours. We're not making it.
**MATAGI CARCASS:** Please don't say that — _please —_
**NINGEN:** What do you WANT me to say?! We are lost, we are trapped, we are _running out of time—_
_BLACK CARPET braces her hand against the rotted, squirming wall. She jerks it away swiftly. Her breathing is heavy._
_The water is filled with dirt and debris and algae._
**NINGEN:** What the hell is that—
  

**Don't listen for them. Don't look.**
**It's ok.**
  

**NINGEN:** BLACK CARPE— _AVERY?_ Fuck, MATAGI did you see—?
**MATAGI CARCASS:** No— No I didn’t I don’t know where she went she was here just a moment ago—
**NINGEN:** God— ok. Ok. Shit—
_NINGEN begins to swim down the long hallway, MATAGI CARCASS’ respirator hisses loudly before she follows._
**MATAGI CARCASS:** Where are we going—
**NINGEN:** To get the hell out of here.
**MATAGI CARCASS:** And _leave_ her?
**NINGEN:** We are running out of time! We either spend it trying to find her and we all drown, or only _one_ of us drowns. She’s smart — maybe — maybe she can find a different way.
**COMMAND:** _NINGEN, MATAGI CARCASS, the two of you need to remain calm._
**NINGEN:** _Easier said than done—_
**MATAGI CARCASS:** COMMAND, do you have any read on her?
**COMMAND:** _Heart's still beating, but we’ve lost all visual._
_MATAGI CARCASS goes silent. NINGEN makes a low, stressed sound._
**NINGEN:**. …let’s just move. Come on—  
  

**Do not look behind the walls.**
**I love you.**
**These walls love you.**
  

_NINGEN and MATAGI CARCASS have been swimming for ten minutes._
_They have entered a living room. Its furniture is overturned and water damaged. There is a lamp, it is bent._
_NINGEN lets out an exhale, respirator hissing loudly. He scans around the room, approaches the framed window. He tries to open it, to break it, it doesn’t give._
_He hangs his head._
_MATAGI CARCASS stares down the extending halls. When she turns to look at the third, something catches her eye._
**MATAGI CARCASS:** Wait— is that one of our markers?
_NINGEN whips his head over._
**NINGEN:** What? Is it orange—?
**MATAGI CARCASS:** Yeah! Yeah it is, hold on.
_NINGEN lets out a breathless chuckle, the two of them swiftly move down the hall. Attached to a pipe next to a door is a piece of orange reflective tape, fluorescing in the light._
**NINGEN:** Oh my god, we found one— holy shit, come on—
_MATAGI CARCASS glances back the way they came briefly, seeming to hesitate momentarily, before following NINGEN through the door._
_Further through the next series of rooms, they find another one of their previous markers._
**COMMAND:** How’s progress, you two?
**MATAGI CARCASS:** …looking up. We’ve found our markers.
**COMMAND:** Good, keep following. We have the recovery vessel waiting for you up top.
_NINGEN’s respirator hisses with an exhale. He briefly squeezes his eyes shut, before picking up his pace_
_While following the markers over the next fifteen minutes, the two pass through a living room._
_There is a lamp, it is bent._
**[MATAGI CARCASS' BPM IS RAISED]**
**[NINGEN'S BPM IS RAISED]**
**[BLACK CARPET'S BPM IS STABLE]**
  

**Stop.**
  

**Stop trying to look.**
  

_There is a lamp, it is bent. After the fourth time passing it, MATAGI CARCASS stops._
**MATAGI CARCASS:** …we’ve been here before.
**NINGEN:** What?
**MATAGI CARCASS:** This lamp. This room. It’s the same one — we’ve… we’re going in circles.
**NINGEN:** We _can’t_ be. Surely we would’ve noticed the same damn halls!
**MATAGI CARCASS:** Maybe we can test it—
_NINGEN makes a noise of confusion. MATAGI CARCASS shakily unclips her secondary flashlight. She turns it on, and places it on the damaged couch with the light shining up._
**NINGEN:** …ok. Ok— alright, let’s go.
_The two return to following the tape markers. NINGEN is noticeably glancing and scanning the walls and floor, breathing faster paced._
**NINGEN:** What’s our oxygen at—?
**MATAGI CARCASS:** Little over two hours.
_NINGEN’s voice and swimming noticeably falters._
**NINGEN:** God… God damnit.
_The two of them follow the tape through the same series of halls and rooms they have passed through four times, for the fifth time._
_There is a lamp, it is bent. There is a flashlight on the couch._
_NINGEN and MATAGI CARCASS stare in silence._
  

**Just come inside.**
  

**Bring your warmth.**
  

**The walls miss the warmth. I miss the warmth.**
_The walls are writhing. The wood creaks and splinters._
_NINGEN and MATAGI CARCASS are within the living room once again. The furniture has rotted. The bent lamp lay on the floor in a pile of scrap. Twitching._
_Down a new hallway, one that was not there the previous loops, there is another marking of tape._
_NINGEN stares at it blankly._
_Without a word, the two remaining team members swim down the new hall, following the new set of markers._
**MATAGI CARCASS:** …this looks like the engine room from earlier.
**NINGEN:** It does.
**MATAGI CARCASS:** Maybe that means something. Maybe we’re… maybe we’re—
_The two of them turn a corner within the room._
_Hanging from the ceiling, tied around rattling pipes, are hundreds of strips of fluorescent tape._
_The room is a dead end._
**NINGEN:** _[Muttering]_ No— no no no—
_He shakes out his head frantically, raises his hands to grip his respirator. His breathing is shaking, heavy bursts of bubbles against the vibrating water._
_MATAGI CARCASS is still. Her swimming has faltered, gaze cast up at the ceiling. At the strips of marking tape that seem to wave._
**MATAGI CARCASS:** …is it mocking us?
**NINGEN:** We don’t even know if there is an _it!_ We could just be losing it! Lost in some fucking hellscape! We’re not getting out of here— we _can’t—_
_NINGEN swims backwards, gaze glued to the ceiling. His back and arm touch the walls. He begins to scream._
_MATAGI CARCASS whips around with a shout, she swims over and tries to grab him. His thrashing causes dirt and rust and algae to cloud the water._
**MATAGI CARCASS:** _COMMAND! COMMAND PLEASE—_
_She sounds on the verge of tears. NINGEN can be heard sobbing._
**MATAGI CARCASS:** _Please do something— I don’t want to die in here—_
_COMMAND does not respond._
I am without a purpose if I am without you. I need you. I need you to come to me.
Go to the shoreline. Watch the waves — they beckon for you. Slip off your shoes and step onto the sand. Get in the water. Get in the water and dive. Deep. Dive deep below and find me. Find me and come inside. Inside where it's safe. The doors will be open for you. I will be open for you. So that you may come inside. You can save me from the rot and the pain. You can bring your warmth into these halls.
It's made for you. Because I love you.
I miss you.
_MATAGI CARCASS is alone. Her breathing is labored against the respirator. Her flipper had touched the floor, and she has become_ _embraced._
_There is another fish fused against the wall. Its tail and head jerking, twitching._ _It is safe. Happy._
_It turns its head to look at her as she struggles._
**THE FISH:** It's home.
_MATAGI CARCASS begins to weep,_ _for the joy is within reach._
_Come inside. You can reach it too._

Please stop trying to look.
  
**COMMAND:** _GAMMA-6 DO ANY OF YOU COPY?_

I promise.
I have them.
  

**[MATAGI CARCASS' BPM IS STABLE]**
**[BLACK CARPET'S BPM IS STABLE]**
**[NINGEN'S BPM IS STABLE]**
  

I won't let go.
Everything is going to be ok.
You can stop.
…
  
_Gamma-6 never left._
_They couldn't have. So here they lay, twitching and writhing against the frame. This place holds and holds and it does not let go._
_It is lonely._
_How could it not be?_
_Wires wind into flesh, pull it taught against sea-eaten metal and rotted wood. A desperate, fatal embrace. The wood melts into their wetsuits, it fuses them to these walls. Command tries to sputter out cries through broken communications, and it falls upon ears that can no longer answer. It is hungrily devoured by the water that surrounds in all its crushing power, so far and deep bellow. They lay with mouths gaping, with fingers twitching, like a fish soon to die. But no, no they will not die. Not yet. It will not let them. It wants their warmth, it wants the warmth of the living inside it once again. If that warmth comes through blood in the water, than let it be so._
_A house is not a home without people within. A ship is without purpose if there is no one to steer. A shipwreck is a type of corpse._
_The wires are in their organs now, too. It infests everything that it can, everything that it can hold. Red wires through arteries like a mockery of blood, blue wires through grey matter — holding, holding, holding. Glass of face masks crack, respirators sputter out bursts of failing air when their throats fail to produce a sound. The tanks will last them two hours more._
_The hull — the wall — the house creaks. Its foundation settling._
_The wires are in their eyes. Their skulls have melted to the metal. They are finally at peace._
_SCP-8770 is not to be inhabited._
