Office of the Treasurer of Finance 

 Shareholding Capital Portfolio

Following the latest update of the PHLOX Highway (2009), it is clear that the impact of SCP-8680 is much higher than estimated. The PHLOX Highway will shortly cease to be either politically or economically viable.

The risk level of SCP-8681 was raised from Safe to Euclid in 2007. The value of the asset is expected to significantly diminish due to recently exposed scandals and unfavorable rumors. For remediation, please review the Supervisorial Complementary Policy prior to activating Protocol SCP-8681-A.

Supervisorial Complementary Policy:

 The Office of the Treasurer of Finance is the primary Foundation representative in PHLOX Inc., responsible for monitoring the performance of the company and examining the value and prospective return of SCP-8681, as well as coordinating the departments of the Foundation to facilitate the smooth operation of the highway.

As per the Shareholder Rights Agreement of SCP-8681-1, the Foundation and other majority shareholders have the power to:

Access all documents of PHLOX Inc. in order to perform routine audits as well as investigate specific occurrences. This responsibility is primarily carried out by the SCP Foundation Department of Auditing.

Review usage of the PHLOX highway to track both individuals and cargo.

Utilize the PHLOX highway without disclosure of such use to other parties.

The promotion on the PHLOX Highway is performed by the Department of Outreach to enhance the Foundation's public image and average capacity of the highway.

SCP-8681-A is to be activated at the discretion of SCP-8681 supervisors or at the request of any majority shareholder.

Description:

 SCP-8681 is the portfolio of all financial and political capital invested in PHLOX Inc. (See Section 2 for more details.) Being the preeminent Foundation investment of the decade, SCP-8681's success is of critical importance to the Foundation's image and finances. Additionally, control of SCP-8681 enables the Foundation to monitor the use of the PHLOX highway. This access is critical to tracking the movement of Groups of Interest, Persons of Interest, and Socially Transmissible anomalies.

SCP-8681 is the utmost and foremost consideration in Foundation decision-making.

SCP-8681-A is the Situational Conjunctional Protocol, a generalized system for calling a compendium of the representative bodies for PHLOX's owners. -A is exclusively to be used in the event of external factors compromising the financial viability of SCP-8681. -A is split into three separate protocols: -AA, used for localized disasters affecting short-term prosperity. -AB, used for scenarios that impact quarterly prosperity, and -AC, used for existential impacts. -AC has been activated a total of 2 times.

FILE 1/1, SECTION 2/4

Background

The SCP Foundation, the Global Occult Coalition, the United States Government and Prometheus Labs, Inc. had formed a long-term partnership in the 

Southern United States Extranormal Organization Cooperation Treaty

 (SUSEOCT). In the late 1990s, Prometheus Labs faced the drawback of overexpansion in former GRU Division "P" territory after 

its degradation

. Financial Strain and Operational Inefficiencies, together with 

the unexpected loss of Prometheus Neurons

, pushed Prometheus Labs to the brink of bankruptcy and dissolution.

In late 1998, not long after 

the Persephone Event

 broke the Veil Protocol, the Foundation and the Coalition were occupied with rectifying the situation in Poland, and were similarly undergoing financial and political hardships. Simultaneously, Prometheus Labs raised an ambitious proposal to connect the Isle of Portland, UK, Portland, Oregon and Portland, Maine with a permanent doorway (the acronymized Portlands Highway: Logistics, Operations, and Exchanges, PHLOX Highway) in the 

Three Portlands

 pocket dimension. The proposal invited the SCP Foundation, Global Occult Coalition and US Government to and save Prometheus Labs from disintegration. Given the chaos of the dissolution of the veil, these groups seized the opportunity to use their resources in a public positive manner. This commercial alliance was later signed into the Gulf of Mexico Agreement on top of the framework of the SUSEOCT in December 1998.

PHLOX Inc.

Hierarchy

To prevent 

the loss of control of SCP-8681

 and abate inefficiencies caused by bureaucratic uncertainty and collaborative administration, the oversight of the PHLOX Highway is implemented with a strictly streamlined hierarchy. A shell company, PHLOX Inc. has been established to hold this hierarchy. It is overseen by a board of directors elected from each majority shareholder. This board elects a CEO. Currently this role is filled by Arnold S. Torch.

Overview

PHLOX currently employs 2,583 personnel. Although employee compensation saw a significant upgrade following the change in management in 2007, the turnover rate has steadily risen to 5% since then.

The major asset of PHLOX Inc. is the PHLOX Highway system (View Section 3 for more details). Besides the management of the highway, another notable service of the company is an ongoing contract signed in 2006 with the Puck Family, a prestigious Sidehe family in the Free Ports. This contract promises the construction of a skyline tower hotel with in extending out of the Three Portlands dimension. This construction notably uses novel technology and does not require the antiquated Somme Dimensional Anchor (SDA) nor the costly EVE anchor.

Despite the revenue of PHLOX Inc. remaining steady, the company's actual income has experienced a decrease of 5% following the replacement of SDA's with EVE Anchors. The operating costs of the EVE-based Dimensional Anchors and employing thaumaturges to power them have proven significantly higher than the original SDA approach. Additionally, in order to insure the continued impact of SCP-8680 (as the highway has remained dangerously radioactive despite 8680's containment), Goldbaker-Reinz Ltd. has increased PHLOX Inc.'s insurance premium by 15%. Lastly, the PHLOX Department of Outreach has increased their operating budget by 30%, the purpose of this is unknown.

Shareholdership

The initial issuance of shares consisted of 1,000 shares, followed by a second batch of 1,200 shares, bringing the total to 2,200 shares. Below is a list of organizational investments in PHLOX as of 2009. SCP-8681 is represented in orange.

Overview of the PHLOX Highway

Portlands Highway: Logistics, Operations, and Exchanges

The PHLOX Highway is a composition highway system that consists of structures in three parts:

Orbital Highway

The Orbital Highway is the main part of the PHLOX Highway, positioned in the Outer Periphery of the Three Portlands dimension. It is a 40km long 16-lane circular highway with a radius of 13km. 73 Shift-Based Sites are provided to maintain structural stability and provide support for road users.

Connection Road

Unlike the Orbital Highway, which is located 4 km away from Three Portlands City and avoids distortions of the anchor to the polar street grid, the Connection Road consists of three two-lane routes that link three car parks near the city’s periphery directly to the Three Portlands.

The road is constructed using 50-meter modular roller road sections, allowing for easy replacement. This is most commonly utilized in remediating damage caused by displaced buildings.

Portal Linkages

The Portal Linkages serve as key access points for auxiliary services and highway entry within the baseline world structure of the Highway. These linkage areas integrate infrastructure, including the Portal Building, customs facilities, power supply, water supply and sewage systems, and internet services. They also serve as warehouses and cargo shipping centers. Additionally, they provide direct highway connections to the existing road network.

The Portal Linkages are located on an artificial island east of the Isle of Portland, UK, as well as in Hazelwood, Portland, Oregon, and Deering Center, Portland, Maine.

Paratech

Somme Dimensional Anchor (SDA)

Invented by Dr. Claire Somme, a former PHLOX Inc. engineer, a type of dimension anchor that compare to the existing anchor in the Three Portlands required thaumaturges using EVE to repair the tears on the dimension regularly, the SDA is a dimension recastor to reshape the dimension tears into new dimension and output to fill the gap.

To cater for the Somme Dimensional Fissure Radiation (SDFR), a unexplained spatial disturbance on the high-frequency electromagnetic spectrum. The tip of the SDA scans for SDFR and produces counter-radiation.

Document revised on 24/05/2007: All SDA have been replaced by EVE-based Dimensional Anchor, Thaumaturges maintain these anchors every three months.

Document revised on 15/12/2007: This maintenance period is now two weeks.

Portal Buildings

Being the main entry points for the Orbital Highway and Connection Road, the arch-shaped Portal spans 10 lanes (70 meters wide, 8 lanes for the Orbital Highway and 2 lanes for the Connection Road). They are 45 meters deep and 30 meters high. To ensure a stable connection between Three Portlands and the baseline world, the portals utilize coordinate integration technology to ensure spatial integrity across dimensions.

The operation centers for the portal system are located within the basements of the Portal Buildings in baseline reality.

The upper levels of the baseline buildings are designated as high-grade office spaces for rent or sale.

Perpetual autonomous Scranton Reality Anchor (PASAR)

To cater for the low concentration of reality in the Outer Periphery, PASARs are installed every 50m of the Highway.

A PASAR is a 10m × 5m × 5m plant integrated with a hybrid system of 

a combination of 2nd Generation (biological material-based SAR) and 3rd Generation (reality siphon SAR)

. It is programmed to autonomously switch to the biological material mode function if there is a delay or resistance in the reality siphon mode and is designated to a new reality for the siphon. The lifespan of the PASAR is estimated to be about 50 years for a replacement of 

biological reality stabilized material

.

O5-11:

 Mr. Pensa you are a guest here, you are not a Foundation employee and this behavior is intolerable. I do not know why a man so skilled at communications is acting this way, though I suspect it is intentional. Regardless of the reason, I'm going to ask you to leave before I ban you.

Joint Report on the PHLOX Highway

General Review 2009

Starting in March 2009, there was a noted rise in the number of patients suffering from acute radiation poisoning. In addition, there were multiple anonymous reports of antimemetically corrupted human remains found in hospitals known for treating radiation poisoning. 

A covert investigation was performed by the SCP Foundation Department of Auditing.

 The following is the executive summary of the investigation drafted by the Risk Analysis Section.

Data

Note from the PHLOX Department of Radiology:

 Due to continuous prior malpractice related to the PHLOX highway (to which this department admits its shameful contribution), in conjunction with the severe recommendation of this report, its authors have chosen to remain anonymous. For subsequent inquiries, please contact 

James Pensa

 at the Department of Outreach, who will forward your communication through the relevant channels.

SBS records show SDFR levels rising to what they were prior to the adoption of uranium-based methodologies after March 2009.

This data is based off of the spending of the PHLOX Department of Outreach. Although the proportion of severe cases remains steady at 2%, considering the annual traffic volume of 500 million motorists, this percentage poses a serious threat to the common good.

Summary of Analysis Report from the Anomalous Radiology Division and Antimemetics Division

View the full report

Department of Radiology

Based on data from the SBSs, the Department of Radiology conducted further experiments in the Outer Periphery for more samples. It found that SDFR levels currently have not changed compared to the test done in June 2007 after adapting the uranium-based approach.

Furthermore, the electromagnetic spectrum appears very different than that of the prior test. It is theorized the SDFR radiation has integrated itself with the uranium radiation, compounding instead of contesting. This is the likely the explanation for the increased radiation rates.

The Antimemetics Division

The Antimemetics Division investigated the antimemetic corruption of human remains. It found that the bodies were patients of acute radiation poisoning. This kind of death accounts for around 10% of the acute radiation poisoning deaths, which is 0.1% of all severe cases.

These cases closely resemble the antimemetic corruption found in the dimensional collapse of SBS-44. A further study on the patients of radiation poisoning in the PHLOX highway discovered that all victims experienced antimemetic corruption on different scales. This may explain the lethality of SDFR.

Conclusions

Borin De Ray

's replacement of the SDA source with regular radioactive substances was a critical misjudgment. The SDFR solution using Uranium has no theoretical support. It is believed that 

De Ray

 concocted this theory out of a proverbial 'gut-feeling' and was never contested.

While this approach appeared to work for the last two years, the annulment of SDFR was more likely due to residual SDA action. In fact, the uranium approach likely only made things worse, combining with SDFR to create antimemetic effects.

Recommendation

Although further investigation on the causation of the SDFR and the antimemetic corruption could be done, it is unnecessary and would only see more people come to harm.

It is the official recommendation of the Risk Analysis Section and the Antimemetics Division that the PHLOX highway system cannot be reasonably kept open. It must be shut down at once citing quarantine efforts for the extant (falsified) radiation plague in accordance with SCP-8680 containment procedures. Failure to do this will result in catastrophic backlash both internally and externally.

DCALFINE:

 Wow. That's even worse than I thought it'd be.

O5-11:

 I know it's against forum policy, but holy shit. I'm glad 

David

 couldn't make it.

SCPFTreasurer:

 That's why I wanted to do this 'in person'. Coordination and unity will be critical for resolving this issue.
