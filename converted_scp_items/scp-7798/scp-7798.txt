Don’t bend; don’t water it down; don’t try to make it logical; don’t edit your own soul according to the fashion. Rather, follow your most intense obsessions mercilessly.

 

IMPORTANT NOTE

The following documents were composed by AI. Some information may seem unrelated, while some important information may not be included.

Composing of this document by a being of class-B or above intelligence has been declared a low priority.

Item #:

 ACO-7798

Location: U-1242, A-5, SC-7, Sys-18, P-3

Object Class:

 Meteor Belt

Closed Knowledge - Moderate Importance

10 individuals of Species ACO-7798-1 wearing clothing, image recovered from ACO-7798-RELIC12.

Description:

 ACO-7798 is a meteor belt. ACO-7798 is believed to have formerly been a planet class object, which disintegrated into its current state through natural means

1

.

Traversal to/through ACO-7798 is not advised due to high meteor belt density, abundance of alternative routes, and low importance. Extraction of natural resources have been set as a low priority due to the value of present resources and isolation from existing Galactic infrastructure.

Artificial resources should be studied, not salvaged. Archeological study of ACO-7798 is deemed low priority, due to its low importance in Galactic history and low chance for new technological insight.

Artifact composition:

Structural ruins (Dwellings, workplaces, gathering places, etc.)- 98.2%

Other relics (Tools, furniture, etc.) - 1.6%

Information cache relics (Written records, storage servers, story-telling monuments, etc.) - 0.2%

Microscopic, cellular life is present. Proof of macroscopic and intelligent life has also been found. Presumed extinct.

Advanced Information:

 ACO-7798 relics consists mainly of structural ruins made up of an artificial stone like material. Day-to-day use relics are mostly made up of processed metals and plastics. Informational caches on ACO-7798 are unusually rare. Initial investigation has shown that all surviving information caches were constructed by a single organization.

ACO-7798 was host to a wide variety of species and biospheres. The dominant intelligent species, classified Species ACO-7798-1, was present on all land environments. They called themselves Homo Sapiens, or Humans. They called their planet Earth. The disintegration of the planet into an asteroid belt is believed to driven the biosphere into its current form. Of note, biological remains of Humans are unusually rare.

ACO-7798 Unorganized Information:

 The following are files have been identified by AI as pertaining to ACO-7798, but have been flagged (by AI) for intelligent organization due to potential for deeper insight into ACO-7798 if organized by Intelligent beings.

Recovered Relics:

Relic Designation

Description

ACO-7798-RELIC1

Refined metal shaped in a long, flat, curved fashion. One end of the item is shaped into a concave oval. Theorized to be a tool.

ACO-7798-RELIC2

Primitive, but intelligently designed, machine. Constructed of curved metals, fabrics, and electronics. Digital reconstruction shows that if restored, the item is capable of locomotion at speeds of up to approximately 50 SQC

2

.

ACO-7798-RELIC3

Long, rectangular object that is constructed from a former flora species. Markings divide the object 1000 equal times, with larger markings each 100th mark. The object measures 1/10,000,000 of the length between the northern most point and the equator of ACO-7798 when it was a planet class object.

ACO-7798-RELIC4

Flat object constructed from heavily processed plant matter. Traces of pigment present. When digitally restored, it displays what is theorized to be an artistic representation of a region of ACO-7798 landmass when it was a planet.

ACO-7798-RELIC5

Mechanical machine constructed from refined metals. Digital reconstruction shows that, when activated, a spark of SiO2 is ignited.

ACO-7798-RELIC6

A compact collection of flat, heavily processed plant matter similar to that of ACO-7798-RELIC4. Chemical analysis shows that it was once bound together on one side with adhesive. Traces of pigment are found on each flat surface which indicate that this item stored information of the anatomy and biology of various species on ACO-7798 when it was a planet. Notably, a large section has no traces of pigment at all. This suggests a large deletion of data.

ACO-7798-RELIC7

A primitive, digital storage device. Digital reconstruction reveals the information to be of primarily the natural processes of ACO-7798 such as geology, actions of various flora and fauna, volcanic activity, etc. Notably, the device has the capacity to store much more than is currently holding. This suggests a large deletion of data.

ACO-7798-RELIC8

An object similar to ACO-7798-RELIC6, but containing different information. Contains artistic representations of various flora and fauna of ACO-7798 when it was a planet. Representations are present only on a few of the available surfaces, the vast majority of surfaces are blank. This suggests a large deletion of data.

ACO-7798-RELIC9

A large, fortified, enclosed structure. A large amount of data relics were found here.

ACO-7798-RELIC10

Not a single object; but the system of cloaking technologies throughout the structure of ACO-7798-RELIC9. ACO-7798-RELIC10 was able to keep ACO-7798-RELIC9 hidden from visual, chemical, and psychological

 detection for a period of 19 cycles

4

 only recently deactivating in the past 0.2 cycles due to deterioration.

ACO-7798-RELIC11

An object similar to ACO-7798-RELIC6, but containing different information. Contains artistic representations of various flora and fauna of ACO-7798 when it was a planet. Representations are present only on a few of the available surfaces, the vast majority of surfaces are blank. This suggests a large deletion of data.

ACO-7798-RELIC12

An object similar to ACO-7798-RELIC7, but containing different information. See ACO-7798-RELIC12 Contents.

ACO-7798-RELIC13

An object similar to ACO-7798-RELIC4, but containing different information. Traces of pigment create a glyph, untranslatable, theorized to be a logo symbol. Below said symbol, the glyphs: "Secure, Contain, Protect"

— RAISA Automated Clerk (RAC)

Special Containment Procedures:

 Foundation Webcrawlers are to monitor the internet for mentions of potential instances of SCP-7798-1. If a potential instance is found, a team will be dispatched to confirm it's validity. If valid, then it will be confiscated and replaced with a non-anomalous object modified to resemble the replaced instance. SCP-7798-1 instances are to be identified by Hume levels slightly below baseline.

Description:

 SCP-7798 is an info-anomaly that affects the branding of certain commercial products, hereafter referred to as SCP-7798-1. Snippets of information will be removed from SCP-7798-1 via anomalous means. For example, the text identifying UpMart as the distributor of Studywise notebooks will disappear, and no traces of ink will remain. To date, only small, typically ignored texts will disappear.

SCP-7798 was identified when the personnel of Storage Site-459 noticed a similarity in a few of their 

Anomalous Items

. These items, now known as SCP-7798-1 objects, exhibited Hume levels slightly below Site-459's baseline. This, combined with the similarity of their anomaly, warranted the classification of SCP-7798 on 2024/4/16.

If replacement of object is not feasible within a $30 price range, amnestics are to be applied to persons who have knowledge of the SCP-7798-1 instance's change.

Description:

 SCP-7798 is an info-anomaly that affects 

all physically and digitally stored information (for example, on books or storage servers.)

, hereafter referred to as SCP-7798-1. 

Noticeable amounts

 of information will be removed from SCP-7798-1 via anomalous means. For example, 

whole pages of information in books will be lost, resulting in a blank page

, and no traces of ink will remain.

Addendum SCP-7798.1:

 SCP-7798 was identified when the personnel of Storage Site-459 noticed a similarity in a few of their 

Anomalous Items

. These items, now known as SCP-7798-1 objects, exhibited Hume levels slightly below Site-459's baseline. This, combined with the similarity of their anomaly, warranted the classification of SCP-7798 on 2024/4/16.

Currently, the primary way of mitigating SCP-7798 from affecting Foundation Documents is storing them within DEEPWELL facilities. However, the cost of doing this with every Foundation document would be incredibly large. Research and development is ongoing in order to reduce costs of maintaining and expanding DEEPWELL facilities.

At the time of discovery, SCP-7798 only affected mostly-ignored texts. However, the amount of information being lost with each discovered instance has grown linearly. As of 2038/7/9, the Foundation estimates a full IT-class "███ ██ ███████████" Scenario by the 2600s if current technology stagnates.

SCP-7798-2

 and does not reflect current understanding at this time.

— RAISA Automated Clerk (RAC)

Special Containment Procedures:

 The discovery of SCP-7798-2 shall be suppressed in all public circles. Research is to be directed towards neutralizing the effects of SCP-7798-2.

Description:

 SCP-7798-2 is a celestial object approximately 1.6x larger than the sun, located 328 light years away from Earth. Noospheric imaging indicates that the information lost from SCP-7798-1 instances go towards SCP-7798-2 at a faster-than-noospheric-light speed.

Information lost as a result of SCP-7798 is always related to humanity in some fashion, whether it describes a man-made object or describes people/personified objects in a narrative. SCP-7798 also never affects information pertaining to natural phenomena. Due to these facts, SCP-7798 is theorized to be hostile to specifically human information and/or life.

SCP-7798-2 seems to travel faster than light. SCP-7798-2 will enter the solar system in 2140s.

ACO-7798-RELIC12-DATA5 "Timeline of Events"

2040/6/5

SCP-7798 article updated to unredact items and lower clearance requirements.

2042/3/8

Foundation reveals the existence of SCP-7798 to all cooperative GOIs and proposes joint research and development projects to combat it. All GOIs agree.

2043/1/1

Large network of sub-veil forces sign the "Arkhive" Treaty, combining and integrating all affiliated GOIs

5

 to better combat the threat of SCP-7798 and potential IT "End of Information" Scenario. The Foundation itself signed the treaty as well.

2050/2/3

DEEPWELL efficiency reaches satisfactory levels to fully store all Foundation documents. Treaties to extend storage rights to other groups within the Arkhive alliance are considered.

2050/2/6

First instance of SCP-7798 affecting human memory is recorded.

2050/2/20

DEEPWELL development team's funding quadruples with the goal of extending DEEPWELL protections to human memories. SCP-7798 is reclassified as Apollyon.

2051/8/4

Due to SCP-7798-2's proximity to Earth, exponential increase of data losses, and exponential increase of memory loss, information suppression becomes financially debilitating. Proposals to drop the veil are heavily debated in Arkhive meetings.

2053/2/4

Final anomalous warning systems warn of SCP-7798's coming peak and SCP-7798-2 arrival.

2053/8/19

Despite numerous precautions both anomalous and mundane, SCP-7798 affects O5-9.

2054/1/2

First recorded instance of SCP-7798 affecting memory to such a degree that an individual enters a coma-like state.

2054/11/12

It is found that near-constant recitation, particularly in synchronization in large groups, helps mitigate the effects of SCP-7798. Hume levels confirm this as anomalous. Recitation is near-immediately adopted across all Arkhive GoIs.

2057/11/12

It is estimated that all non-veil involved humans have been affected in some degree by SCP-7798

2058/3/1

SCP-7798-2 increases speed. New estimated entrance into the solar system: 2081/5/9

2058/6/2

After 3 months of intense debate, an insubordinate faction within the Global Occult Coalition attempts to coup GOC leadership. Though unsuccessful, tensions within Arkhive grows to unprecedented levels.

2060/8/16

The Global Occult Coalition falls into civil war due to an even larger insubordinate faction. Hostilities erupt between Arkhive members over which faction to support. O5-3 assassinated. Veil protecting operations slow down as major resources are directed towards defense.

2060/8/20

Arkhive dissolves, most GOIs return to independent operation. A new alliance called the Holy Occult (Consisting of the Sarkic Cults, the Church of the Broken God, and the Horizon Initiative) is formed. Sporadic skirmishes between GOIs erupts. Foundation maintains isolation at this time, prioritizing self defense and anti SCP-7798 development. Veil maintenance fully halts at this time.

2061/3/2

Due to prolonged hostilities and lack of veil maintenance across all major GOIs, public awareness of the anomalous reaches all time high. The O5 Council declares the veil officially broken.

ACO-77B8-PF:

Item #:

 ACO-77B8-PF

Location: U-1242, A-5, SC-7, Sys-24

Object Class:

 Megafauna

Need-To-Know Basis - Moderate Importance

Description:

 ACO-77B8-PF was a celestial planetary megafauna that has since perished. It measures 3.8 astronomical units and exhibits a gravitational pull value of 5.8. Superficially, it resembles a black hole.

When it was alive, ACO-77B8-PF was a major hazard. The creature traveled beyond light speed, making its appearance rapid and disruptive if not tracked. In addition, it derived its nutrition through siphoning intelligent information. Evacuation efforts, as well as leaving enough junk information to satisfy it, was very costly.

On Cycle 4118, Orbit 678, Division 76

6

 ACO-77B8-PF was found dead after a period of stagnancy raised suspicion. Cause of death was found to be complete cessation of KGT Process, rendering ACO-77B8-PF to reveal its true form as a rocky planet. A glyph was etched onto the surface of ACO-77B8-PF when it was found dead.
