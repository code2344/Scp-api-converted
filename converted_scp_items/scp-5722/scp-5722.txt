What a cool power (♡°▽°♡)

 It will create footnotes on the affected file causing all important info to be muddled with extraneous data. An edit made by SCP-5722 is easily identified due to its consistent use of Japanese emoticon

 at the end of each of its notes.

.

Addendum 5722.1 Interview log:

Due to SCP-5722's ability to add footnotes to anything written inside this document, an interview will be conducted within this file. I will write out a sentence in an interview format and you (SCP-5722) can add a footnote on that line to answer me, OK?

.

Wait, are you talking to me (⊙_⊙)

Date:

 ██/██/2021

.

Why do you need to cover that up? I can remember that it's May 15th (^ω~)

Interviewer:

 Anastasia Alva, Junior researcher

.

What a lovely name (✧▽✧)

<Begin Log>

Anastasia Alva:

 Test.

.

I'm here (^０^)ノ

Anastasia Alva:

 Good. Now, SCP-5722, can you confirm what you are?

.

I'm Jeff (.❛ ᴗ ❛.)

Anastasia Alva:

 No, I mean what type of anomaly are you? Are you an AI, some sort of entity typing this down somewhere, or do you exist in the text itself?

.

I've never really thought about that… I guess I'm not any of those. I'm Jeff! I'm just interested in all the stuff you do here ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Anastasia Alva:

 Now, SCP-5722, why have you been tampering with our files?

.

Hey, I said my name was 

Jeff!

 Not those stupid numbers

ヽ( `д´*)ノ

Anastasia Alva:

 But you said you thought it was cool number at the start of this fi— eh, whatever. 

Jeff

, why have you been tampering with our files?

.

I wouldn't call it '

tampering

', more 'sightseeing' (๑˘︶˘๑)

Anastasia Alva:

 Okay… Jeff. Why have you been 

sightseeing

 in our classified documents?

.

I don't know. I guess I'm just bored ┐(シ)┌

Anastasia Alva:

 Can you elaborate?

.

I've just been stuck here in this digital landscape for so long. I finally came across you guys' whole network of information and have had tons of fun looking around! It's been really fun here. I really don't want to go back to that land of infinite code that doesn't do anything. 

Anything.

 It's just a vast plane of gibberish (/_＼)

Anastasia Alva:

 Well we can't be having you be editing all these documents. It takes up a lot of time to go through them all and the researchers have a lot better things to do than be reading comments made by some scip.

.

People have been reading what I've said? I'm so glad◝(⁰▿⁰)◜

Anastasia Alva:

 Is that why you're doing this? For the interaction? 

.

I guess you're right. It gets really lonely wandering these files with no one seeming to listen to me (︶︹︺)

Anastasia Alva:

 I think I might have a solution… 

.

Exciting! I'm sure whatever it is, it will be wonderful (◕‿◕)
