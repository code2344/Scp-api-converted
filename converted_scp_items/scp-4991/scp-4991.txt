F.A.Q.

{$doesthisfixthebug}

 

 

 

 

BY ORDER OF THE OVERSEER COUNCIL

The following file describes a Neutralized anomaly. By order of O5-1, unauthorized access is forbidden.

4991

 

 

 

Special Containment Procedures:

 All social networking websites affected by SCP-4991 have had their records of the incident completely erased. A cover story of an ARG (Alternate Reality Game) has been implemented in case any proof of the incident remains.

Description:

 SCP-4991 was a period between April 7th, 2016 and April 9th, 2016, when major social networking websites such as 4chan, Reddit, Tumblr, and Twitter began creating posts that referenced non-existent events. During this time, users were met with errors that hindered their ability to post. All posts that were created during this period were made by existing accounts.

Two days after SCP-4991's manifestation, all anomalous activity ceased, and users could interact with the websites normally. By a vote of 11 to 1, the O5 Council reclassified SCP-4991 as Neutralized, and the current containment procedures were established. No anomalous activity similar to SCP-4991 has been detected since the incident.

Addendum 4991.1

SCP-4991 was discovered early in the morning on April 7th after Foundation operatives were alerted to most social networking websites being inaccessible, and users reported posts appearing that they were not making. Upon order of the Council of the United, all of these websites were shut down, and a viral Class-K Amnestic was released following SCP-4991's demanifestation.

The following are examples of posts made during SCP-4991.

Moor stepped out of the agreement. It's almost like when the "world is ending" he starts to get a bit antsy. Is Earth not good enough for you?

The Foundation has always been about Money and Money alone, so I'm not surprised. The Secure-Ment Plan would cost them a shit ton of fucking money, so much that it might put them out of business forever. It seems they have a "I'd rather die than pay this" mentality right now, unless we're missing something.

I'm a bit mad, but I think I know why they aren't doing ths. I am like 99% certain that because of the recent uprising in Egypt, the Secure-Ment plan would fuck over most villages around the Middle East-ish area, which would probably cause more harm than good. Probably.

It makes sense, but it's still a dick move.

Essentially, it was an agreement between the US Government and the SCP Foundation in order to reduce the amount of bugs that are currently flying everywhere. It would require the budget from several large nations, and would consist of the deployment of several specifically engineered pesticides in order to kill these bugs en masse. The plan required the SCP Foundation to use around 90% of their budget, due to the fact that these pesticides are hell to make.

For some reason, The SCP Foundation, a couple days ago, after stepping out of the agreement, completely disappeared. Everyone associated with them completely vanished, and all of their sites are completely empty. The production of the pesticides were put on hold, and now the bug population has increased tenfold.

I'm in Edswardville, Virginia. I'm holding out in my basement. If anyone needs shelter, come. I have food for around 6 months, and water to last us a year. Pray for us.
