Special Containment Procedures

SCP-907 is currently utilized as a field asset for the Department of Extraterrestrial Affairs (Exploration Division) as part of Project MOTHERSHIP. It is housed within Laboratory 3 of Site-54.

SCP-907 has been outfitted as a mobile research station, containing two EVA suits, four remote-operated drones, 24 sample storage units, compositional analysis equipment for soil and atmosphere samples, and the necessary supplies and equipment to sustain two researchers for up to fourteen days relative time before returning to earth. Additional specialized equipment will be included in mission payloads according to mission specifications.

All samples gathered using SCP-907 are subject to extraterrestrial material quarantine procedures, as per Section 5.2 of the DEXA Exploratory Operations Policy.

The following points warrant addition to the return roster:

Destination types designated ‚Äúhigh rarity‚Äù (See Document 907-EXT)

Presence of anomalous phenomena.

Presence of an ecosystem, either extant or extinct.

Presence of habitation by a technological civilization, either extant or extinct.

Remnants of prior Foundation operations.

If such a destination is reached, return roster entries marked non-essential may be replaced at discretion of the survey team.

Exoworlds hosting MOONWALK facilities are not to be removed from the return roster unless continued Foundation presence is judged to pose a threat to the continuation of Project MOTHERSHIP or present a danger to the Foundation at large.

4) SCP-907 returns to Site-53. Samples are removed for study. Observational recordings are handed off to the DEXA Data Team. Returning personnel are granted one week‚Äôs personal leave. SCP-907 is inspected for damage and prepared for the next expedition.

 

Description

SCP-907 is a 1967 Volkswagon Type 2 microbus (T1 panel variant, Dove Blue) capable of interplanetary teleportation. Vehicle has been maintained in good condition. The left front tire had been recently replaced at the time of recovery and the odometer remains stuck at 99999, but otherwise there are no mechanical aberrations, signs of major damage, or large-scale repair work. Vehicle contained the following items at time of recovery:

Key with blue rabbit‚Äôs foot accessory.

Pair of novelty plush dice suspended from the rear view mirror.

Paperback copy of 

Elric of Melnibon√©

 (Moorcock, 1972), found in the glove compartment.

Parking ticket issued by San Francisco police department 03.MAY.1969, used as bookmark for the above item at page 58/59.

Napkins, plastic utensils, chopsticks, condiment packets (assorted).

$1.43 USD in change.

250 kilograms of phosphorus in sealed plastic containers.

Ticket stub for 

Return of the Jedi

. The number 34 is written on the back in permanent marker.

Aftermarket decorative modification to side panels (airbrushed):

Right: Wizard in purple robes, wielding crystal sphere, shooting lightning at green dragon.

Left: Frazettesque swordswoman, fighting a cloaked figure with a burning crown.

Upon engine turnover, SCP-907 will disappear from local time-space and undergo a variable-duration state of transit before arriving on the surface of an extrasolar planet, at which point the engine may be safely disengaged.

.

Turning off the engine mid-transit is presumed to either trap SCP-907 in the transit state indefinitely, or force it to re-emerge in interstellar space prior to reaching its destination.

 SCP-907 will return to its departure location on Earth after a variable number of destinations, progressing through a seven-step Fibonacci Sequence.

.

The cycle has a single one-destination stage instead of two, and thus progresses 1-2-3-5-8-13-21 before repeating.

Transit time is dependent on the gravitational force at the point of departure, as per the following equation:

T = ((G*œÄ) * Œ¥S )2 * n

T = Transit time in seconds

G = Gravitational force in meters per second squared

Œ¥S = 2.4142‚Ä¶

n = Number of transits that have occurred since SCP-907 departed from Earth, inclusive.

SCP-907 and all parties within are subject to a mild time dilation, accumulating time debt at a rate such that for every second experienced by SCP-907 in transit, 

n*œï

 seconds will have elapsed on Earth. This will result in a minimum time-debt of 1.1618‚Ä¶ seconds per second, and a maximum of 24.3978‚Ä¶ seconds per second. This relativistic effect only occurs during transit: time progresses without noticeable distortion after reaching a destination.

Neither SCP-907 nor persons and objects contained within are affected by external environmental conditions. Interior atmosphere, pressure, and temperature will remain as on Earth even when doors or windows are opened.

.

The oxygen / carbon dioxide content of the vehicle‚Äôs internal atmosphere does not fluctuate, regardless of human presence over time.

 Any object or part of an object that passes beyond the boundary of the vehicle‚Äôs frame will be subject to environmental conditions as normal. This property does not apply to SCP-907 while it is located on Earth, where internal atmosphere and temperature are affected normally by external conditions. The internal atmosphere does not fluctuate in oxygen or carbon dioxide content regardless of the number of individuals or time spent within.

SCP-907 is capable of bookmarking a total of 36 destinations for return trips. To access return list destinations, the novelty dice are placed on the dashboard with the desired number combination facing upward

.

Numbers will be read left to right from the point of view of the driver.

; this will cause SCP-907 to transit to the linked destination when activated, and it will continue to do so for all further transits until the dice are removed, a new destination is selected, or it returns to Earth.

In order to set a destination to the return list, the dice should be placed on the dashboard in the desired combination. The brake pedal should then be fully depressed twice in quick succession, followed by a single use of the horn. This will link the current location with the number combination, overwriting the previously saved destination.

It is not known what criteria determine the destination or length of transit, if there is a limit to the number of possible destinations, if it is possible to return to a previously-visited destination without usage of the return function, or if it is possible to recover or return to an overwritten destination.

As of ‚ñà‚ñà/‚ñà‚ñà/2018, 3592 extrasolar destinations have been recorded. 81% of these have been rocky or icy bodies measuring between 0.15 and 3.75 Müú®, 4% have been conclusively positioned within the Milky Way, 18% have had their home galaxies identified within the Local Cluster, and the remainder cannot be accurately positioned with the means available to the research team. No life, traces of life, or secondary anomalies have been found on any of the exoworlds accessed by SCP-907 that cannot be explained by the presence of Project MOONWALK facilities.

Full documentation of explored exoworlds, as well as all recorded versions of the recall list, may be found in the DEXA Planetary Database.

 

History

SCP-907‚Äôs full chain of custody is lost; from the available evidence, the item was acquired by an undocumented Epsilon Command field cell in the early 1970s but was not logged into the main SCP item database until 1992.

Date

Description

09.OCT.1992

Item recovered alongside SCP-‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà, SCP-‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà, and twenty-seven minor anomalous objects from a Epsilon Command field storage location in Humboldt County, California.

.

This storage location and over a dozen others were provided by re-integrated Epsilon field agents as part of Operation HALOGEN.

 Item assigned to Special Project Group LUCIAN after its anomalous properties were verified as a potential asset.

1992 - 2001

SPG LUCIAN conducts 164 survey missions with SCP-907. No secondary anomalies are found.

14.SEP.2001

Survey missions put on indefinite hold during post-9/11 internal restructuring.

14.MAY.2002

SPG LUCIAN is dissolved alongside the remaining Special Project Groups by Overseer Council Special Order 1056. Item is transferred to the Department of Extraterrestrial Affairs but is not returned to active use due to department downsizing and lack of meaningful experimental results when compared to other DEXA assets.

.

While the surveys carried out by SPG LUCIAN resulted in an immense corpus of data, the 2001 restructuring was accompanied by a general trend towards dismissal of non-anomalous scientific study as irrelevant to the Foundation‚Äôs mission.

22.APR.2008

SCP-907 survey missions resume after the resignation of DEXA director Dr. Hamm and appointment of Dr. McCoy.

03.JUN.2011

Maintenance of SCP-907 reveals previously-undetected folded paper sheet (legal pad, yellow) taped underneath the driver‚Äôs seat. Sheet contains directions for activation and use of the recall function, encoded in a known E-Command cipher..

15.JUN.2011

Discovery of undocumented Foundation research station on RHODES.

21.JUL.2011

Project MOTHERSHIP instituted.

 

Project MOONWALK

A retroactive designation for a defunct exoplanetary colonization program carried out by an unknown Foundation or formerly-Foundation party, beginning no earlier than 1967 and ending no later than 1992. Project MOONWALK encompasses nine known facilities, all found on exoworlds accessed via SCP-907‚Äôs recall list. These facilities were abandoned and non-functional at the time of discovery

Additional facilities may have been constructed on exoworlds removed from the return list. If any exist it is extremely unlikely that they will be rediscovered, unless additional recall functions are found. No references to SCP-907 exist within the surviving corpus of Epsilon Command records, nor did any re-integrated Epsilon field agents profess any knowledge of the anomaly or its use.

.

The consequences of organizational compartmentalization in the wake of the Panopticon Crisis were greatly increased in E-Sector due to the total loss of the sector command cell in 1975. For further information on the collapse of Foundation operations in the region, see Incident Report HOLBROOK.

. This discrepancy has led to the hypothesis that the MOONWALK personnel were acting entirely independently of Epsilon Command, potentially working alongside an external Group of Interest, but this is supported only though circumstantial evidence.

.

Special Project Groups SALLUST and APULEIUS have been suggested as potential operators of SCP-907, having been active in E-Sector during the mid to late 1970s, but evidence again remains circumstantial.

The nine MOONWALK facilities and their host planets are listed below in order of discovery.

Facility Alpha
