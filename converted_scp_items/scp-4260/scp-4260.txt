Object Class: Euclid

RAISA Notice Regarding the Following Document:

This document has been significantly edited to obfuscate the identity of SCP-4260; several addenda have been omitted, and are only available with 

Level 5/4260 Clearance

.

Strayer Density Matrix Mark I, Research Site-76

Special Containment Procedures:

 Area-03, located two kilometers beneath Hong Kong, has been created to contain SCP-4260. The containment chamber housing SCP-4260 has been augmented with a Strayer Density Matrix designed to coalesce and bind its disparate elements.

Maintenance of the Strayer Density Matrix is integral to SCP-4260's containment and requires a specialized team of technicians and speculative essophysicists

1

. MTF Gamma-8 ("Baphomites") has been assembled for this expressed purpose and will perform any necessary repairs to the Matrix and operate it during Procedure 8917

2

.

Procedure 8917 requires a joint operation between three mobile task forces, assembled to ensure its effective completion. The assigned task forces, denoted collectively as Amalgamate Force Omicron-45, and their functions are as follows:

MTF Gamma-8 ("Baphomites"):

 Assembled from technicians proficient in the operation of Strayer Density Matrices and speculative essophysicists from RTF Iota-39 ("Gods and Monsters") who will assist in their direction.

MTF Xi-2 ("Out of the Shadows Come We, Darkly"):

 An armed Mobile Task Force specializing in combat with essophysical, deity-class entities. MTF Xi-2 will engage SCP-4260 and terminate it, ending the initial stage of Procedure 8917.

MTF Tau-900 ("Deliverance"):

 An armed Mobile Task Force specializing in the location of civilians accidentally affected by a successful neutralization of SCP-4260. MTF Tau-900 will then terminate all targets and remove evidence of the procedure's efficacy.

Procedure 8917 is considered complete when the following criteria are met.

SCP-4260 has been successfully terminated.

The Strayer Density Matrix is fully operational.

All affected civilians have been located and terminated.

All evidence of Procedure 8917 has been removed.

SCP-4260 has been resurrected.

The document detailing SCP-4260 uploaded to the Foundation intranet is to contain numerous omissions, in order to obfuscate the identity of SCP-4260.

Description:

 SCP-4260 refers to the consciousness of an essophysical entity which has permeated itself through the known universe. The effect of SCP-4260's existence has been well documented by almost every sapient culture. Termination of SCP-4260 has resulted in the neutralization of its primary anomalous effect until its resurrection during Procedure 8917.
