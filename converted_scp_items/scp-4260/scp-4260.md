Strayer Density Matrix Mark I, Research Site-76
**Special Containment Procedures:** Area-03, located two kilometers beneath Hong Kong, has been created to contain SCP-4260. The containment chamber housing SCP-4260 has been augmented with a Strayer Density Matrix designed to coalesce and bind its disparate elements.
Maintenance of the Strayer Density Matrix is integral to SCP-4260's containment and requires a specialized team of technicians and speculative essophysicists[1](javascript:;). MTF Gamma-8 ("Baphomites") has been assembled for this expressed purpose and will perform any necessary repairs to the Matrix and operate it during Procedure 8917[2](javascript:;).
Procedure 8917 requires a joint operation between three mobile task forces, assembled to ensure its effective completion. The assigned task forces, denoted collectively as Amalgamate Force Omicron-45, and their functions are as follows:
  * **MTF Gamma-8 ("Baphomites"):** Assembled from technicians proficient in the operation of Strayer Density Matrices and speculative essophysicists from RTF Iota-39 ("Gods and Monsters") who will assist in their direction.
  * **MTF Xi-2 ("Out of the Shadows Come We, Darkly"):** An armed Mobile Task Force specializing in combat with essophysical, deity-class entities. MTF Xi-2 will engage SCP-4260 and terminate it, ending the initial stage of Procedure 8917.
  * **MTF Tau-900 ("Deliverance"):** An armed Mobile Task Force specializing in the location of civilians accidentally affected by a successful neutralization of SCP-4260. MTF Tau-900 will then terminate all targets and remove evidence of the procedure's efficacy.

Procedure 8917 is considered complete when the following criteria are met.
>   1. SCP-4260 has been successfully terminated.
>   2. The Strayer Density Matrix is fully operational.
>   3. All affected civilians have been located and terminated.
>   4. All evidence of Procedure 8917 has been removed.
>   5. SCP-4260 has been resurrected.

The document detailing SCP-4260 uploaded to the Foundation intranet is to contain numerous omissions, in order to obfuscate the identity of SCP-4260.
**Description:** SCP-4260 refers to the consciousness of an essophysical entity which has permeated itself through the known universe. The effect of SCP-4260's existence has been well documented by almost every sapient culture. Termination of SCP-4260 has resulted in the neutralization of its primary anomalous effect until its resurrection during Procedure 8917.
