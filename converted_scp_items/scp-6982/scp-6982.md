> State your name for the record.
_A birthday party. Fifth, maybe? Seventh?_
_A kid sat alone. It was her birthday, yet no one cared. She listened to the laughter around her._
_She knew they were just here for the cake._
  
  

> Jayden Carver.
  

> How did you find out about the Foundation?
  

> I just… know.
  

_The ball flew by. She turned her head, but she stayed where she was. She never really liked sports._
_They screamed at her to go. It didn't matter._
  

> You just know?
  

> I just know. What more is there to say?
  

> Alright, moving on. What made you come here?
_"Nora?"_
_The kids around her snickered. She rubbed her eyes. "Huh?"_
  
  

> I think… I was supposed to.
  

> Elaborate.
  

> It has to do with the knowledge. I…
  

_A loud bang._
_She had dropped her textbook._
  

> You what?
_Screaming. Disappointment._
_Bad grades._
_A promise._
  
  

> I don't know.
  

_Can't go._
_Frustration._
  
  

> I don't… know what I was saying.
  

_Lonely._
  

_A friend._
_Someone who wouldn't leave._
  

> Okay, what's going on?
_A job offer._
_Stuck._
  
  

> Your, uh, your memories…
  

_A secret._
_A horrible secret._
  

> My memories?
_A ritual._
_A sickness._
_A gun._
  
  

> It's not right, though. I've been seeing…
  

_**A gun.**_
  

* * *
> You mentioned my memories yesterday. What'd you mean?
  

> I don't… I don't remember what I said.
  

_Cheering. Congratulations._
_She could barely hear them over the static. They were happy for her, but…_
Is this a branch?
  

> After I asked what was going on?
_Screaming._
_An argument right as she tried to speak. She sat at the table, but it didn't mean anything._
  
  

> Oh.
  

_She opened her mouth, but no words came out._
_A secret left forever untold._
  

> Are you always this… spacey?
  

> Not before. My condition's been getting worse.
  

> Your condition?
  

> I see memories. Not voluntarily.
  

_The animal froze, eyes wide._
_She slammed on the brakes._
_Glass flying through the air._
_A sharp pain._
_It was too late to make amends._
  

> Shit. How much did you see?
  

> You won't like the answer no matter what I say.
  

> Just- let's keep this between us.
* * *
> How well do you remember the memories you see?
  

> Depends. Some really stick with me, but others… I forget.
  

> Alright, uh, do you know anything about this?

This is…
  
  

> Your, uh… I don't… think so.
  

> Fair enough.
_More time._
_As she disappeared under the surface, she wished for more time._
  
  

> Look, I've seen your timelines.
  

> What?
  

> I've seen your futures, and you never tell anyone. You always die wishing you could've said something.
  

> Said something…

_It was time to dig up the past._
