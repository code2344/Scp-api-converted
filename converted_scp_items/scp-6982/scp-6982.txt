State your name for the record.

 

A birthday party. Fifth, maybe? Seventh?

A kid sat alone. It was her birthday, yet no one cared. She listened to the laughter around her.

She knew they were just here for the cake.

 

Jayden Carver.

 

How did you find out about the Foundation?

 

I just… know.

 

The ball flew by. She turned her head, but she stayed where she was. She never really liked sports.

They screamed at her to go. It didn't matter.

 

You just know?

 

I just know. What more is there to say?

 

Alright, moving on. What made you come here?

 

"Nora?"

The kids around her snickered. She rubbed her eyes. "Huh?"

 

I think… I was supposed to.

 

Elaborate.

 

It has to do with the knowledge. I…

 

A loud bang.

She had dropped her textbook.

 

You what?

 

Screaming. Disappointment.

Bad grades.

A promise.

 

I don't know.

 

Can't go.

Frustration.

 

I don't… know what I was saying.

 

Lonely.

 

A friend.

Someone who wouldn't leave.

 

Okay, what's going on?

 

A job offer.

Stuck.

 

Your, uh, your memories…

 

A secret.

A horrible secret.

 

My memories?

 

A ritual.

A sickness.

A gun.

 

It's not right, though. I've been seeing…

 

A gun.

 

 

You mentioned my memories yesterday. What'd you mean?

 

I don't… I don't remember what I said.

 

Cheering. Congratulations.

She could barely hear them over the static. They were happy for her, but…

Is this a branch?

 

After I asked what was going on?

 

Screaming.

An argument right as she tried to speak. She sat at the table, but it didn't mean anything.

 

Oh.

 

She opened her mouth, but no words came out.

A secret left forever untold.

 

Are you always this… spacey?

 

Not before. My condition's been getting worse.

 

Your condition?

 

I see memories. Not voluntarily.

 

The animal froze, eyes wide.

She slammed on the brakes.

Glass flying through the air.

A sharp pain.

It was too late to make amends.

 

Shit. How much did you see?

 

You won't like the answer no matter what I say.

 

Just- let's keep this between us.

 

 

How well do you remember the memories you see?

 

Depends. Some really stick with me, but others… I forget.

 

Alright, uh, do you know anything about this?

This is…

 

Your, uh… I don't… think so.

 

Fair enough.

 

More time.

As she disappeared under the surface, she wished for more time.

 

Look, I've seen your timelines.

 

What?

 

I've seen your futures, and you never tell anyone. You always die wishing you could've said something.

 

Said something…

 

She grabbed her shovel.

It was time to dig up the past.
