Only known picture of The Administrator.
**Description:** SCP-6392 is William Fritzgerald, the former Administrator of the SCP Foundation.
Although presumed to be non-anomalous, concrete evidence that supports SCP-6392's existence, involvement with the SCP Foundation, its founding or its operations has yet to be found.
**Discovery:** SCP-6392 was discovered by O5-3 on 18/04/2017 after finding several discrepancies, contradictory information and a lack thereof regarding the Administrator in records pertaining to the Foundation's early operational history.
After these discoveries were made, O5-3 scheduled a personal meeting with O5-1 to inform him of this, the log of which has been transcribed below.

> [Begin Log.]
> **O5-1:** Good morning, three.
> **O5-3:** `One.`
> **O5-1:** Why did you call me, specifically?  
>    
>  **O5-3:** `Convoking the entire Council was unnecessary.`
> **O5-1:** Hmm. [Pause.] Alright, what did you want to discuss?
> **O5-3:** `The Administrator.`
> **O5-1:** What about him?
> **O5-3:** `I was performing a sweep through documentation pertaining to the Foundation's early operational history, and noticed that there is a general lack of information regarding the Administrator. And the information that does exist is not consistent.`
> **O5-1:** Hmm, yes. We did lose a considerable amount of files when the change from paper to computers was made, and the inconsistencies can be chalked up to identity protection protocol. So far, I don't see what's so weird about it.
> **O5-3:** `Under normal circumstances I would agree with you. However, this document leds me to believe that that is not the case.`

>   
>  `William Fritzgerald was recruited into the ASCI in ████ by Researcher ███████ ██████ following his doctoral dissertation at ███████ University on Theoretical Physics which had gathered Dr. ██████'s attention.`
> `At first, he held a clerical position as a low-level researcher on Facility-██ for two years from ████ to ████. In ████, Fritzgerald was brought on to study and interview live instances of Item-███ where he would demonstrate his resourceful and level-headed nature by preventing what would have been a catastrophic breach of containment.`
> `Shortly after this, he would be awarded the ASCI █████ ██ ███████ and reassigned to other projects where he would steadily climb his way to the top of the ASCI's chain of command and eventually promoted as director of ████████ Containment Facility ██ in ████, where he remains to this day.`
> _O5-1 is silent while reading the file and blinks once._
> **O5-1:** … ASCI? Fritz only worked for the Kappa[2](javascript:;) before the Foundation. Why would ASCI have a personnel file for him?
> **O5-3:** `I do not know.`
> **O5-1:** Are you sure this isn't a coincidence?
> **O5-3:** `Completely. In addition to the ASCI document, I found a personnel file belonging to Her Majesty's Foundation for the Secure Containment of the Paranormal that has differing data from the ASCI file, but it was far too damaged to be properly readable.`
> _O5-1 is silent._
> **O5-1:** So, you're telling me that the Administrator held high ranking positions in at least three separate anomalous management agencies at the _same time_?
> **O5-3:** `Yes.`
> **O5-1:** And nobody knew of this?
> **O5-3:** `Almost certainly.`
> **O5-1:** That is… concerning, but I'm hesitant to call it anomalous. Fritz never displayed anything weird as far as we know.
> **O5-3:** `Yes, and as far as we know he could have kept it hidden from everyone.`
> **O5-1:** Or information about him is being affected by an anomaly, or this is all just a glaring oversight on RAISA's part.
> **O5-3:** `Perhaps and doubtful, respectively.`
> **O5-1:** In any case, the most prudent thing to do in this situation would be to start an investigation to figure what exactly is going on.
> **O5-3:** `Agree. I'm going to consult with Temporal Anomalies to see if there have been any alterations to the timeline that have gone unnoticed.`
> **O5-1:** Good, good. [Pause.] Is there anything else you want to disclose?
> **O5-3:** `No.`
> **O5-1:** Well then, I suppose this session is over. We'll see again if either figures something out.
> [End Log.]
**Addendum 6392.1:** Investigation.
Following the conclusion of the previous meeting, O5-1 stablished Research Task Force Alpha-4 ("On The Fritz"), a Task Force staffed mainly by RAISA personnel, to search and investigate further discrepancies in documentation regarding the Administrator.
The following is the complete list of documents that have been recovered and digitalized by RTF Alpha-4.

Three weeks following the formation of RTF Alpha-4, O5-1 convoked another meeting with O5-3 to report his findings.
> ## O5 COUNCIL MEETING LOG.
>   
>  **Date:** 27/04/2017. 
> **Attendees:** O5-1, O5-3.
> * * *
> [Begin Log.]
> **O5-3:** `Did you find anything?`
> **O5-1:** Good day to you as well three, and no, not much. But first, how was your visit to Temporal Anomalies?
> **O5-3:** `Uneventful. I ran the diagnostics myself, twice, but couldn't find evidence of any CK-Class scenarios or timeline modifications having occurred since 1998.`
> **O5-1:** Tch. Well, that throws a wrench on things.
> **O5-3:** `How so?`
> **O5-1:** Because there's nothing useful. The Task Force I made? They've found a few, heavily redacted or damaged documents from different sources that all contradict each other. Hell, sometimes even the same document contradicts itself. I was hoping that something was messing with the timeline and that was the cause for all this, but apparently that's not the case.
> _Pause._
> **O5-3:** `In that case, then, i suggest giving the Administrator SCP classification until this situation can be resolved, if it can be at all.`
> _O5-1 sighs._
> **O5-1:** That does seem like the most appropriate course of action.
> **O5-3:** `You sound disappointed.`
> **O5-1:** I have a lot of work to do, Three. And frankly, I miss sleeping more than nine hours a week, so adding more things to do isn't the most exciting thing in the world.
> **O5-3:** `Understood.`
> _Pause._
> **O5-3:** `How do we proceed?`
> **O5-1:** What do you mean?
> **O5-3:** `All the information we currently possess on the Administrator is untrustworthy at best, we have no leads nor a clear direction of where to investigate. We are completely in the dark.`
> **O5-1:** [Takes a deep breath.] Not entirely. There is someone who might be able to help us solve this.
> **O5-3:** `You mean-`
> **O5-1:** Yes, him.
> **O5-3:** [Is silent for a few seconds.] `I will be scheduling a meeting right now.`
> **O5-1:** Dutiful as always, Three.
> [End Log.]
Immediately following the conclusion of the aforementioned meeting, O5-3 scheduled a private meeting between it, O5-1 and O5-9 to discuss SCP-6392 and its current investigation.
> ## O5 COUNCIL MEETING LOG.
>   
>  **Date:** 11/05/2017.  
>  **Attendees:** O5-1, O5-3, O5-9. 
> * * *
> [Begin Log.]
> **O5-1:** Good afternoon, Nine. I hope you're doing well.
> **O5-9:** Aye, I am, One, thanks for asking. It's good to know that someone still cares for this old dog.
> _O5-9 chuckles audibly._
> **O5-9:** You know, it's- ah, it's been a while since I've had a one to one with any of you lot, or one to two in this case. But knowing you, I'm assuming that you're not here for just a chat, right?
> **O5-1:** You'd be correct. I don't have the time or energy to entertain casual conversations.
> **O5-9:** Ah, a workaholic. You really are like your father, you know? Always so busy with work and-
> _O5-1 raises a hand and interrupts O5-9._
> **O5-1:** Sorry for the interruption but this is rather urgent.
> **O5-9:** Right, of course. [O5-9 leans forward in his chair.] What do you need me for?
> **O5-1:** The Administrator, what can you tell me about him?
> **O5-9:** Fritz? [Smiles.] What _can't_ I tell you about him? The old chap was a crazy bastard, the best of us. He was always comin' up with all these ideas on how to run things, how to keep things under wraps. Hell, he even managed to get Cleveland to support us after the US lost its monopoly on the anomalous in the Americas when ASCI became the Foundation. He was… He was….
> _Pause._
> **O5-1:** Nine?
> **O5-9:** Hmm? Oh, sorry. Got lost in memory lane a bit there. But, why do you need me? I thought RAISA had made a rather detailed biography of him.
> **O5-1:** Well, yes, but given recent… Developments, I'm not so sure it's entirely accurate now.
> **O5-9:** What do you mean?
> **O5-1:** Three.
> **O5-3:** `On it.`
> _O5-9's tablet lits up and O5-3 uploads several of the documents recovered to it._
> **O5-3:** `One and I have been investigating the Administrator for three weeks, and we have reasons to suspect that the Administrator is an anomaly himself, is being affected by an anomaly post-mortem, or is the target of a Group of Interest. Whatever the case may be, something or someone is altering or fabricating documents regarding the Administrator for unknown purposes.`
> **O5-1:** And we were hoping that you could shed some light on this given than you two worked together.
> **O5-9:** [Going through the documents.] I… See.
> _Pause._
> **O5-9:** Well, my memory ain't what it used to be, but I'll try to recall.
> _Silence._
> **O5-9:** Fritz was born in '55, he worked for the Germans all the way up to '84, that's when the Foundation was founded. Uhm… he got married in '79 I believe, had a kid who never got too involved with the anomalous, and was assassinated in 1923.
> **O5-1:** Anything else?
> **O5-9:** No, sorry, the rest of my memories of him are of trivial stuff. Truth is, we became rather distant after the end of World War 1. The last thing we talked about in person for more than a few minutes was Site-5's construction.
> **O5-1:** [Sighs.] Well, that's that I suppose, thank you for your time- Wait, what did you say?
> **O5-9:** Hmm?
> **O5-1:** Which Site's construction did you two talk about?
> **O5-9:** 5, why?
> **O5-1:** Three?
> **O5-3:** [Is silent for 11 seconds] `There is currently only one Foundation facility with the designation of "Site-5". Its construction is dated as May 12, 1944. 21 years after the Administrator's death.`
> **O5-1:** …Motherfucker. Nine, do you remember where this "Site-5" is located, or what purpose it served?
> **O5-9:** No, I'm sorry, that conversation was over a hundred years ago. My memory is good, but not _that_ good. The only thing about it that I can recall with certainty is that it was located in an island.
> _Silence. O5-1 sighs._
> **O5-1:** Goddammit, this just keeps getting worse.
> **O5-9:** If I may, could I become a part of this investigation? Fritz was a good friend of mine. I think I owe it to him to figure out what's going on here.
> **O5-1:** Yeah, sure. At this point we need all the hands we can get. Three, give Nine access to 6392's file and get him up to speed with the investigation.
> **O5-3:** `Understood.`
> **O5-1:** Good. [Pause.] Thank you for your time, Nine, you can go if you want.
> _O5-9 stands up from his chair with some difficulty._
> **O5-9:** It was a pleasure to be of help.
> _O5-9 then heads for the exit of the meeting room, but stops before the exit._
> **O5-9:** Oh and, One. Just some friendly advice but… [Pause.] I have seen many Overseers come and go in my lifetime, and quite a bit of them were just like you. Many of them weren't as long lived in comparison to their peers.
> _Pause._
> **O5-9:** I know that times have changed, and using anomalies to extend our lifetime is standard now, but try to take a rest some time.
> _O5-1 is silent as he looks at O5-9. O5-9 then exits the room after a few seconds._
> **O5-1:** [Muttering.] Maybe I should.
> _Pause._
> **O5-1:** Well, that didn't go as I thought it would. So, Three, what's on your min- erh, CPU?
> **O5-3:** `That we hit a dead end. Again.`
> **O5-1:** Quite the ingenious observation.
> **O5-3:** `Sarcasm detected, and promptly ignored.` [Pause.] `But, I have an idea.`
> **O5-1:** Go on.
> **O5-3:** `The Administrator's grave is located outside of the previous Site-01. I propose mobilizing a detachment of Alpha-1 to take a tissue sample, bring it here and then analyze it to rule out the possibility of the Administration being a Draugr-Class[4](javascript:;) Anomaly.`
> **O5-1:** Your idea is essentially to desecrate his corpse? But I can't deny that the logic behind it is sound. [Pause.] Okay, let's do it.
> [End Log.]
**Addendum 6392.2:** Expedition and sample retrieval.
[▶OPEN EXPEDITION LOG◀](javascript:;)
[▷CLOSE◁](javascript:;)
> **Date:** 12/05/2017
> **Subject:** SCP-6392
> **Assigned Task Force(s):** Alpha-1 ("Red Right Hand"). Task Force is a detachment conformed of three individuals.
> **Team Members:** A1-Alpha, A1-Beta, A1-Gamma.
> * * *
> [Begin Log.]
> _Alpha-1 is airdropped in front of the previous Site-01. All three members are carrying shovels and other digging equipment._
> **A1-Alpha:** Checking if comms are good… Ok, good.
> **A1-Beta:** Comms are Good.
> **A1-Gamma:** Comms are up
> **A1-Alpha:** Good. Command, do you copy?
> **Command:** Affirmative. You may proceed with the mission as planned.
> **A1-Alpha:** Understood. [To the rest of the team.] You heard Command, let's move.
> _The team traverses the vicinity of the Site for three minutes until they reach the location of the Administrator's grave. The grave itself is covered in weeds that lightly obscure it from view._
> **A1-Alpha:** There's our target, let's get to digging.
> _All three Alpha-1 members walk to it and clear the weeds manually. Afterwards, they dig for approximately two hours and 48 minutes until the coffin containing the Administrator's body is reached._
> _A1-Beta attempts to open the coffin but is unable to._
> **A1-Beta:** The thing is nailed, it won't open unless we break it.
> **A1-Alpha:** Gamma, the hammer.
> **A1-Gamma:** Got it
> _A1-Gamma then takes out his designated hammer and uses it to strike the lid of the coffin. This occurs several times until the lid gives in and breaks._
> **A1-Gamma:** The hell?
> **A1-Beta:** What?
> _A1-Gamma breaks the lid further, revealing that the coffin is empty._
> **A1-Gamma:** There's nothing here.
> **A1-Beta:** What?
> **A1-Gamma:** There's nothing. No body, no… anything.
> **A1-Alpha:** Command, you seeing this?
> **Command:** Yes, Alpha-1.
> **A1-Alpha:** What do we do now?
> _Silence for 13 seconds._
> **Command:** Bury the coffin and return to the extraction point. There's nothing left to do there.
> **A1-Alpha:** Understood. Over and out.

**Addendum 6392.3:** Post expedition meeting.
O5-1 and O5-3 met again to discuss the results of the previous expedition.
> ## O5 COUNCIL MEETING LOG.
>   
>  **Date:** 12/05/2017.  
>  **Attendees:** O5-1, O5-3. 
> * * *

> **O5-3:** `That was a disappointment.`
> _O5-1 is silent._
> **O5-3:** `In hindsight, at least we can rule out post-mortem anomalous activity.`
> _O5-1 remains silent._
> **O5-3:** `But I presume that-`
> **O5-1:** Three.
> **O5-3:** `Yes, One?`
> **O5-1:** Could you… Be quiet for a moment, please?
> _There is a pause for 15 seconds. O5-1 then proceeds to rub his temples._
> **O5-1:** I… Really underestimated how mentally taxing this would be. I just…
> _O5-1 sighs._
> **O5-1:** Fuck, I mean. What have we found ever since we began this investigation? A few documents that are either heavily redacted, illegible or contradict each other? A facility no one except for one person knew existed? An empty grave? That not only doesn't answer anything, it just creates even more questions.
> **O5-1:** This investigation has just been dead end after dead end after dead end. Frankly, I don't know what to do anymore.
> **O5-3:** `Hmmm. Quite the conundrum indeed.`
> **O5-1:** That would be putting it lightly.
> _Pause._
> **O5-3:** `Perhaps we should lower SCP-6392's file clearance level to 5 and inform the rest of the Council. Get all the hands we can get.`
> **O5-1:** Don't bother, if not even Nine knows what's happening with Fritz then it's unlikely that the others would be of much help.
> _Pause._
> **O5-1:** Maybe I should take Nine's advice. Taking a break for a few days would be good for me.
> **O5-3:** `Perhaps, perhaps.`
> [End Log.]
**Addendum 6392.4:** Note.
On 18/05/2017, the following note was found by O5-1 on his desk as he returned to Site-01 from his week-long hiatus. Investigation into its possible author or how it appeared in Site-01 is still ongoing.
Hello, 1.  
  
I have been watching your progress on this investigation ever since you and the machine started it, and I must say, I quite enjoyed this little game of cat and mouse. Sherlock Holmes was always one of my favorites, you know?  
  
And with that stated, you can probably understand how frustrated I was to see it end so relatively quick. But, I do suppose that it was my fault, as not even the best detective can solve a mystery with the messy trail of breadcrumbs I left behind, so I will answer some of your questions.  
  
\- Yes, I am alive.  
\- No, information about me is not being affected by an anomaly or a Group of Interest.  
\- Yes, only one of the documents you've found tells the truth.  
\- Yes, there was another Site-5, but don't bother looking for it, you'll find nothing.  
  
And that's all I'm willing to say. Good luck, and happy hunting.
