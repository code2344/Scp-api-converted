**SCP-7956** \- One-Way Trip to the Bathroom
[More by me!](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/ndheckfire)
* * *
* * *
**Assigned Site** | **Site Director** | **Research Head** | **Assigned Task Force**  
---|---|---|---  
Site-400 | Director Adam Desmond | N/A | N/A  
* * *
**Special Containment Procedures:** With approval from Site-400's current site director, SCP-7956 has been given permission to continue his long-term employment with the Foundation. He is currently under the observation of the Department of Human Resources (see below).
* * *
**Description:** SCP-7956 is the designation given to Senior Researcher Verre D'eau, the Division Co-Head of Site-400's Department of Anomalous Communications and Relations. SCP-7956 is an adult male of French-Singaporean descent, 171 centimeters in height with black hair and brown eyes.
SCP-7956 is capable of transmuting himself (and any clothes worn by him at the time) into exactly 250 milliliters of water (H2O). During this state, SCP-7956 is not able to carry out any form of mobility due to his static liquid condition, though he has informed research personnel that he still somehow retains his biological senses, specifically sight, hearing and smell.
It's important to note that SCP-7956 does not require the same volume amount of water in order to transmute back into human form. However, the exact limit of this particular aspect of SCP-7956's anomaly is as-of-yet unknown.
* * *
**Addendum 7956-1, HR Intervention:** Following several complaints filed by some of Site-400's personnel, the Department of Human Resources has issued a verbal warning to SCP-7956 to refrain from scaring individuals by transmuting himself into an empty cup and surprising them by transmuting back when they get close.
SCP-7956 has been informed that another similar offence will result in stricter disciplinary action. He has assured HR officers that he will try his best to act in accordance with the Department's provided guidelines.
* * *
**Addendum 7956-2, Incident Log/Disappearance:** SCP-7956 has officially been reported missing on the 7th of June, 2018. He was last seen entering Site-400's breakroom (unoccupied at the time) around 12:00 PM, with camera footage showing him snickering to himself while holding an empty glass cup before doing so[1](javascript:;). After he failed to attend a scheduled meeting, his colleague, Dr. Jaxon Curran, went ahead and attempted to search for SCP-7956 all throughout Site-400, before ultimately reporting his disappearance to General Security (GenSec). This led to the discovery of the aforementioned camera footage, though due to unforeseen maintenance issues, the surveillance camera located in the breakroom was not able to be examined.
Subsequent investigation revealed that the only other individual who entered the breakroom after SCP-7956 was Junior Officer Stakan Vody, a newly-transferred security personnel assigned to GenSec. In an interview conducted with a polygraph device, he claimed that he entered the breakroom at 12:50 PM and wanted to withdraw a soda from the vending machine situated there[2](javascript:;). After seeing that the vending machine had not been restocked, he admitted defeat and exited the breakroom at 1:00 PM[3](javascript:;). When inquired if he ever came across SCP-7956 (or any other personnel) in the breakroom, he denied it, saying that he was alone when this occurred.
As Officer Vody seemingly has no involvement in SCP-7956's disappearance, he was allowed to leave the interrogation without any further questioning. The search for SCP-7956 is still ongoing, with the entirety of Site-400's personnel having already been notified and encouraged to keep an eye out.
* * *
**Addendum 7956-3, Incident Log/Recovery:** On the 9th of June, 2018, personnel stationed at Acroamatic Abatement Facility AAF-Y/400[4](javascript:;) reported seeing an unknown humanoid entity wading aimlessly through the excrement repository of the Non-Anomalous Assorted Waste Section (or the NAAW Section). The entirety of AAF-Y/400's operation was immediately put under indefinite lockdown, and security personnel outfitted with specialized AcroaMat suits were dispatched to properly handle the situation.
Without delay, the security personnel were able to surround and entrap the humanoid using a heavy metal net. A remote-controlled rover was sent to approach the entrapped humanoid in order to ascertain its appearance and possible origin. However, upon closer inspection, it was discovered that the humanoid was actually SCP-7956, who was at the time extremely dehydrated and malnourished.
Security personnel were fortunately able to quickly transport SCP-7956 to Site-400's Health and Pathology Clinic for emergency medical treatment. He was promptly given specialized nutrients via intravenous injection and now currently sits in a comatose state. This incident was reported to the Department of Human Resources, who has spearheaded the investigation into the nature of SCP-7956's present condition.
On another and possibly unrelated note, attending nurses assigned to SCP-7956 have reported that the individual in question possesses an unknown and seemingly irremovable foul odour constantly emanating from his body, described as being similar to the smell of urine.
Footnotes

[2](javascript:;). According to Officer Vody, he has exhausted himself after volunteering to aid personnel in preparing for the [Site-400's 100th Year Anniversary](/scp-7520) celebration.
