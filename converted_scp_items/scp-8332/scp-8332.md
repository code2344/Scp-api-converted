There exist no tenable intervention strategies for SCP-8332. It was inevitable.
**Description:** On 12-01-2024, 09:37:16 EST, Junior Researcher John Mahler (SCP-8332-A), aged 33, abruptly suffered total cardiac failure in combination with severe, spontaneous blunt force trauma throughout his body. Injuries sustained included: shattered pelvis, shattered femur & tibia, ruptured left femoral artery, perforated large intestine, left kidney, stomach, and bladder (resultant of pelvic bone fragments), fractured skull, fractured left arm, collapsed left lung, and partially severed left foot.
* * *
SCP-8332-A's death was instantaneous and incongruous with its immediate causal context, prompting tentative designation as an anomalous event until further investigation.

SCP-8332-A and SCP-8332-B's activity from 2016-2021 display highly congruent patterns of mental health treatment and inconsistent employment. Data from prior to 2016 is erratic and incomplete (Pending).

Documents recovered from the personal belongings of SCP-8332-A and SCP-8332-B indicate superficial or inconsistent cognitive consideration of the polar instance, colloquially described by Dr. Harman Waters as "Lopsided"
From 1994-2000, SCP-8332-A and SCP-8332-B both attended Banyan Creek Elementary School. Findings suggest this time period was the only span of such in which the two anomalies had sustained direct interpersonal interaction; this is corroborated via entries and one superlative[1](javascript:;) in the school's 2000-edition yearbook.
