SCP-4508
**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4508 is currently held in Safe Security Locker 6 at Site-71.
The Parazoology Division sends patrols to the area of discovery on a monthly basis. Any otter populations will be observed and contained if necessary.
**Description:** SCP-4508 is a 1.7 meter tall statue depicting a Eurasian otter (_Lutra lutra_), of unknown geologic composition. No feasible method of damaging SCP-4508 has been discovered. Etched into the base of SCP-4508 is the Arabic word النبي[1](javascript:;).
Sealed within SCP-4508 is a human male identified as Thomas Lapen, designated SCP-4508-1. Despite SCP-4508-1 lacking the ability to consume food or water, MRI scans indicate its vital signs remain stable. The lucidity of SCP-4508-1 is currently unknown.
**Discovery:** The Foundation was tipped off by an emergency call originating from Hallsburg, Oregon after the caller claimed that their friend was "abducted by evil otters". Field agents found evidence of a struggle in SCP-4508-1's home, and SCP-4508 was discovered in the back yard surrounded by used candles and various species of shellfish.
**Addendum 4508 -1:** The following excerpts are from SCP-4508-1's text message records, detailing the chain of events leading to the discovery of SCP-4508.
