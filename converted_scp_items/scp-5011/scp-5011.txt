LIVING ARCHIVE DOCUMENT: LEVEL 4 SECURITY CLEARANCE REQUIRED

The following documentation is curated by Chief Archivist Bridge. It is still considered an active security breach and as such has received perpetual exemption from -ARC or -EX reclassification. This will be reviewed in the event of SCP-5011's cultural significance diminishing.

…The veil between light and dark is very thin, barely translucent. A pair of eyes glimpsing what’s really on the other side can alter the course of history.
