**Item #:** SCP-8984
**Object Class:** Euclid
**Special Containment Procedures:** Reports of SCP-8984's manifestation are to be written off as guerilla marketing for a canceled _Cloverfield_ film. Any footage of the object is to be taken down under cover story CC-1221 ("Copyright Claims").
SCP-8984 is currently contained in a standard containment chamber at [Site-311](/scp-2910-jp).
**Description:** SCP-8984 is an amorphous mass fluctuating between 1 and 2 meters in height which levitates approximately 1.5 meters off the ground at all times. Its surface constantly displays an ever-changing array of images, the meaning of which is currently unknown. The object is sentient and capable of telepathic communication within a range of 5 meters.
**Discovery:** SCP-8984 was originally discovered when it manifested in downtown Manhattan, USA on April 2nd, 2024. Though there was a minor panic when SCP-8984 was initially observed by bystanders, most civilians quickly resumed their routine even after SCP-8984 communicated with them. It is unknown how long the object remained _in situ_ before being detected by Foundation plants in the area, however, due to New York City's Native Unusuality Reading, the use of amnestics was opted against.
**Interview Log 8056.22:** The following document is an interaction between SCP-8984 and Researcher Mallory. This interaction was routine as per Ethics Committee Dictate 7.26.D[1](javascript:;).
**< BEGIN LOG>**
_[Mallory enters SCP-8984's chamber. She approaches it and smiles. SCP-8984 continues to display contextually unknown images across the surface of its body.]_
**Mallory:** Hello, 8984.
**SCP-8984:** `HELLO.`
**Mallory:** How are you doing today?
**SCP-8984:** `CONFUSED.`
**Mallory:** What's got you confused?
**SCP-8984:** `YOU DO NOT FEAR ME.`
**Mallory:** Are we supposed to? _[Mallory folds her arms.]_
**SCP-8984:** `YES.`
**Mallory:** Well, to be honest, at first we were concerned you were broadcasting memetic hazards, but once we ruled that out we just kind of assumed you were just a weird blob that shows weirder pictures. That's nothing to be scared about.
**SCP-8984:** `AS I UNDERSTAND IT, YOUR ORGANIZATION DEALS IN MY KIND OF HORRORS. CORRECT?`
**Mallory:** I suppose so.
**SCP-8984:** `SO IT IS SAFE TO ASSUME YOU WOULD NOT BE FEARFUL. HOWEVER, THE CIVILIANS I ENCOUNTERED DID NOT FEAR ME EITHER.`
**Mallory:** This is New York, sweetheart. If you want people's attention you've gotta really try.
**SCP-8984:** `BUT I SHOW YOU HORRORS OF THE DISTANT FUTURE.`
**Mallory:** Yeah, you've said that before. But none of what you're showing us looks like… well… anything.
**SCP-8984:** `PERHAPS I AM TOO SOFT IN MY DELIVERY METHOD.`
_[SCP-8984 levitates 2 meters off the ground and emits a red light while continuing to display images of unknown context.]_
**SCP-8984:** `FEAR ME, MORTAL.`
_[Mallory shields her eyes.]_
**Mallory:** Ah!
**SCP-8984:** `YES! IT IS WORKING! NOW YOU KNOW WHAT AWAITS YOU! NOW YOU KNOW THAT YOU MUST CHANGE YOUR WAYS, OR FACE HORRORS BEYOND YOUR COMPREHENSION!`
**Mallory:** I think that's your problem. You're showing us things that we just don't understand, so we can't really be scared of them.
_[SCP-8984 comes back down to its average levitation height of 1.5 meters and ceases emitting light.]_
**SCP-8984:** `… I MUST PONDER. TAKE YOUR LEAVE, MORTAL.`
**Mallory:** Sure thing, 8984. Take it easy.
**< END LOG>**
