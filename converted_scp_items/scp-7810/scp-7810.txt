Item #:

 SCP-7810

Object Class:

 Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:

 Additional copies of SCP-7810 are to be confiscated and contents photographed upon discovery. Personnel handling SCP-7810 are prohibited from reading its contents, except with testing pre-approval. Entities E-7810-01 through -174 are to be contained in habitats containing sufficient terrestial and aquatic ecosystems appropriate for their species. During testing, SCP-7810's 175th chapter is forbidden from being read. Should HK-E-7810-14 be realized, she must be praised immediately. Individuals who summoned HK-E-7810-14 must be relocated to the nearest body of water.

Description:

 As of March 15th, 2028, SCP-7810 is a 175 chapter non-fiction book, published in 1800 CE titled "Ducks. Ducks? Geese? GEESE! SWANS!?!?" subtitled "A Guide to the Featherly Host and How to Survive". SCP-7810 is credited to Drake M. Gosling

1

 and published by Mallard Books, a supposed subsidiary of Penguin Books.

2

 Seventy copies of SCP-7810 have been discovered by the Department of Acquisition and Liquidation as of March 15th 2028 in 58 different major and regional languages and dialects.

174 of SCP-7810's chapters are dedicated to the documentation of all 174 extant species of the bird family Anatidae, referred to frequently as members of 'The Holy Fowl', 'The Featherly Host', and 'The Celestial Feathered Ones'. Descriptions of each species matches baseline physical characteristics, with the exception of height and weight. Behavior, environmental, and psychological descriptions of each species are anomalous. Upon reading a chapter of SCP-7810, the species described within will manifest into baseline reality. These entities are thus labeled as E-7810-01 through 174, with the second number indicating which chapter of SCP-7810 triggered their manifestation.

3

 Each recovered instance of SCP-7810 has slight variations to its chapters, theorized to be a result of cultural drift, local folklore, and anomalous circumstances. Additionally, each chapter is written with a different voice and style than the chapter that preceded it.

Partial transcriptions of SCP-7810 do not retain their anomalous properties.

The final chapter of SCP-7810 contains a passage that ends with a seemingly random number that has decreased since the anomaly was first discovered. In 1958 when first identified, this number was at 42. As of 04/02/2028 it is at 25.

As of 04/08/2028 SCP-7810 exhibits a low level memetic effect on associated documentation over time, primarily affecting ancillary documentation and image captions. The reasons for this are unknown.

Upon clearing access to the containment unit and cutting through to the interior of the plane, responding agents discovered the plane was filled with E-7810-021 and their droppings.

Manifestation:

 E-7810-172 was manifested into a light containment habitat. Upon materialization, researchers attempted to take measurements, at which point the lone individual dispensed a cone of pure lightning, instantly vaporizing 2 of the 3 attending researchers. It proceeded to eviscerate and remove the remaining researchers’ limbs, before breaching containment. MTF PSI-32 “Birds of a Feather” were deployed, but not before an additional 15 personnel were killed. E-7810-172 could not be subdued with conventional weaponry, and a prototype Omega-15 Atomic Disseminator had to be deployed to neutralize the entity, resulting in severe damage to a quarter of the East Containment Wing of Site-116.

Addendum HK-E-014

Chapter 175 of SCP-7810 deviates substantially from the rest of the book, and is dedicated to an HK class entity

27

, designated HK-E-014, known as Doland. HK-E-014's baseline description is given in the excerpt below:

For lo she is a grandiose queen, with green feathery hair, possesses the voice, wings, and ferocity of a swan, and the aggressiveness of a goose. She is Mother goose, Queen of the Mallards, Baroness of the pond. Our Savior, our Goddess, Doland be praised! May Doland ever approve us!

Upon reading Chapter 175 of SCP-7810 mentally or aloud, HK-E-014 will manifest in reality. Any individual within visual line of sight who fails to praise HK-E-014 in a substantial way are slowly transformed into a random member of the Anatidae family over the course of 5-7 days.

28

 The individual responsible for bringing HK-E-014 into reality will be immediately immobilized, unable to move from their current location, and subsequently embraced in HK-E-014's wings. Upon release, the target individual will have been transformed into a new E-7810-XXX and an additional chapter added to SCP-7810.

Footnotes

1

. Foundation historians were able to identify 15 Drake M. Goslings and one Ryan Gosling, none of whom can be traced to SCP-7810.

2

. Penguin Books was founded in 1935.

3

. 

Doland be praised.

4

. 

Doland approved.

5

. 

And she made a promise to all, that they would be remade in her image. And whence they were, she was glad and they were glad.

6

. 

Those who knew wrote of her roguery, her playfulness even in the dark of her forgotten rine.

7

. 

For thence did she call to all her rascals, and even those of other times knew of whom they were called.

8

. 

Doland laughed.

9

. 

But in the blackest of pits She did not yield to the fowlest of intentions. No, Her love for all burned strong in the piercing pitch of the abyss.

10

. 

"For even those in their most wayward hours must be aided!" She said unto us. We listened, oh how we listened!

11

. 

Oh how we cried as we fell backwards onto our knees! For how many had we left to the wayside in all our travels! But lo, She forgave! Oh how She forgave! And sought to bring us home!

12

. 

"And thou whilst never know fear!" She proclaimed to the flock.

13

. 

"For when cataclysm threatens you shall find reprieve! For Doland's blessing are many! Hark, look upon the thy companion perched on yonder head! No? Yes that is perfection for she cannot be seen! Rejoice! Rejoice!"

14

. 

Doland threw the dice.

15

. 

"For all shall know the greatest joys in life. For money shall be no object, nothing but a vanity of well tidings. And with it you shall make plenty among the humans, and their flock. And therein you will spread my word!"

16

. 

Doland approved.

17

. 

"And all shall know the beauty of our siren's song. And to their souls we shall cry, and we shall sing, of the glory of feather perches on high."

18

. 

And they slew and desecrated Her favorite child. Many perished against their 

hardened steel

. Their blades cold with the icey winds of towering peaks as they swam from the coldest skies unto the fertile lands. They burned and slew. So many lost. So many lost.

19

. 

And Her response was swift and terrible. "Lo!" She cried to the people from the heavens "You shall avenge me for thou arts sons of Rome. LET CARTHAGE BURN. LET THE EARTH BE SALTED. NEVER AGAIN SHALL SHE LAY HANDS UPON MY CHILD."

20

. 

Doland snapped.

21

. 

AND SO THEY CAME. IN THOSE DESPERATE HOURS WHEN ALL HOPE WAS BLEAK. THEY SANG TO HER, AND DOLANDS SONG GREETED THEM. THE TRAGEDY OF THEIR YOUTHS, THE PLUNGES FROM BUILDINGS AS SWEEPING EXCHANGES OF MEANINGLESS LINES ROLLED DOWN UPON THEM. HARK TO ME. HARK TO ME CHILDREN OF MANN, SO YOU SHALL BE WELCOME AND NONE SHALL SUFFER.

22

. 

Doland awwed.

23

. 

And so she remade a special love in her long lost's image. And so she ensured none would dare try again.

24

. 

Doland ruffled with rage!

25

. 

AND WHEN THEY STRUCK DOWN THAT BEAUTIFUL CREATION SHE CRIED OUT. OH HOW SHE WEPT. BUT NOT OUT OF MALICE DID THEY STRIKE BUT FEAR. AND SHE PROCLAIMED "MERCY MERCY! FOR MY CHILD! FOR THE CHILDREN OF MAN. YOU SHALL KNOW MY LOVE, AND YOUR SINS BE TAKEN. COME TO ME MY CHILDREN. LET US DISPENSE WITH THIS DISTRACTION YOU AND I."

26

. 

Doland swooned.

27

. Deific Class Subjugation Entity.

28

. 

Doland disapproved.
