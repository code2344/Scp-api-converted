Description:

 SCP-8474 is a mind-affecting phenomenon known by its unprecedented impact on the world's birth rate in the past few centuries. It is mainly characterized by a biological female's unwillingness to accept a gestation.

In order to accelerate the recovery from all the damage caused by SCP-8474, the Department of Biology and Medical Science is now working on the development of new forms of childbirth.
