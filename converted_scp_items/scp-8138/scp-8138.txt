SCP-8138:

 

Dead

 Man Walking

Author:

 Doctor Scrappy

There is more to it than there may initially seem.

Special Containment Procedures:

 SCP-8138 is to be contained within a modified humanoid anomaly cell, accommodating for its anomalous properties.

1

 The standard dietary regimen for humanoid anomalies is not to be provided to SCP-8138. It is to be allowed access to Site-67’s garden area,

2

 supervised by at least one member of Level 2 security staff. Any deviations in SCP-8138’s behavior 

(see below)

 are to be reported to Site Dir. B. Dellen immediately.

Description:

 SCP-8138 designates a male human of Asian descent, standing at approximately 175 centimeters, identified as Caishen Feng.

3

 SCP-8138 does not display any need to intake sustenance, hydration, nor does it excrete any waste products; despite this, however, SCP-8138’s bodily functions continue to function within acceptable parameters.

It is either unable or unwilling to move, nor does it respond to any attempts at communication, or outside stimulus.

SCP-8138 came to the attention of the Foundation on 09/13/2011, where reports of an individual displaying its anomalous properties within the Tongji Hospital, Shanghai, China, emerged. It was discovered with several medical devices attached onto its body.

[BEGIN RECORDING]

(Dr. Krug enters the cell, a cup of coffee in hand, and sits down across SCP-8138.)

(He places the cup of coffee onto the table between him and SCP-8138.)

Dr. Krug:

 Greetings, Mr. Feng. I am Dr. Adam Krug of the Strategic Care Partner Foundation.

 Excuse the unusual circumstances.

(5 seconds of silence. SCP-8138 remains unresponsive.)

Dr. Krug:

 Could you please tell me about yourself? About your condition?

(10 seconds of silence. SCP-8138 remains unresponsive.)

Dr. Krug:

 Mr. Feng, I am unable to provide help if you don’t respond to my questions.

(10 seconds of silence. SCP-8138 remains unresponsive.)

Dr. Krug:

 

(sighs)

 Then I will return at a later time, when you’re in condition of talking, Mr. Feng.

(Dr. Krug motions for security personnel to unlock the door.)

Dr. Krug:

 

(whispers into hidden microphone)

 Subject unresponsive to all inquiries. Abort interview.

Dr. Krug:

 Excuse me for the inconvenience, Mr. Feng! I…

(SCP-8138 does not respond, nor move in any way.)
