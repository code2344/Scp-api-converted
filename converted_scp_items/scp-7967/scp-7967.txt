Description:

 SCP-7967 is a device developed by the Department of Tactical Theology in 2003. It was designed to harvest the abnormally high amount of Akiva Radiation that is produced when a human being dies.

SCP-7967 functions through the theory that before entering an afterlife, a being tends to worship at greatly increased levels, a result of attempting to enter a 

positive afterlife

 and contemplating one's mortality.

This energy tends to dissipate shortly after the subject's death. SCP-7967 functions by tracking these events and using Wozny-Hellman Worship Sinks to absorb it successfully.

Addendum

SCP-7967 has been deemed to be nonfunctional and has gathered no Akiva Radiation in the two months since its activation. This is believed to be a result of the fact that although during this period approximately 11,000,000 humans have become corpses, none of them have died.
