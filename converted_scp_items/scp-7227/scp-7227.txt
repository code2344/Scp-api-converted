 Hello Mx.! Sorry to bother you, can I show you something?

 Sure.

 Is that an Army of Monsters card?

 It is, it is! Do you play?

 I did, once. Actually…

 A GOLDEN BLISS BLIGHT!?!?!???!??!

 Mx. Thorley! Mx. Thorley!

 Hey kiddo, how can I help you?

 I've been taking care of him, just like you asked. See! He's nice and safe with me.

 It sure seems like it, though I think you might have me confused with someone else.

 Really? But they looked just like you…

 Just like me?

Thorley:

 Well, nevermind that! Actually, while you're here, mind completing a super secret mission for me?

 One only you can complete. I need you to sneak into my office and fill my

 Mind if I sit?

 Didn't you already ask to sit?

Thorley:

 What? No.

Trintavon:

 I could have sworn—

Thorley:

 This again?

Trintavon:

 Excuse me?

Thorley:

 What's with everyone acting like there are two of me? I could stand it when all of you kept pretending I didn't exist, but this? It's getting on my nerves.

Trintavon:

 …right. My apologies.

<Trintavon resumes his work quietly while Thorley continues to eat their burger. A few minutes pass before Thorley speaks again.>

 You ever feel like you're going crazy?

 More and more, as of late. You?

Thorley:

 All of the time. All of the fucking time.

<The pair stare at each other for a few moments. Finally, Trintavon sighs and returns to his work. Thorley takes a minute to finish their burger before standing to leave.>

Trintavon:

 It's not impossible, you know.

Thorley:

 Pardon?

Trintavon:

 That there are two of you. Just something to consider.

 What?

 Constantly being confused for someone else?
