**James:** Really? But they looked just like you…
**Thorley:** Just like me?
_< James nods, still frowning.>_
**Thorley:** Well, nevermind that! Actually, while you're here, mind completing a super secret mission for me?

**Thorley:** You ever feel like you're going crazy?
**Trintavon:** Sometimes, why?

**Trintavon:** Didn't you already ask to sit?
**Thorley:** What? No.
**Trintavon:** I could have sworn—
**Thorley:** This again?
**Trintavon:** Excuse me?
**Thorley:** What's with everyone acting like there are two of me? I could stand it when all of you kept pretending I didn't exist, but this? It's getting on my nerves.
**Trintavon:** …right. My apologies.
_< Trintavon resumes his work quietly while Thorley continues to eat their burger. A few minutes pass before Thorley speaks again.>_
**Thorley:** You ever feel like you're going crazy?
_< Trintavon laughs.>_
**Trintavon:** More and more, as of late. You?
**Thorley:** All of the time. All of the fucking time.
_< The pair stare at each other for a few moments. Finally, Trintavon sighs and returns to his work. Thorley takes a minute to finish their burger before standing to leave.>_
**Trintavon:** It's not impossible, you know.
**Thorley:** Pardon?
**Trintavon:** That there are two of you. Just something to consider.
