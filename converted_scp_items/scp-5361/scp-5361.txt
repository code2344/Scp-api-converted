Instance of SCP-5361

Item #:

 SCP-5361

Object Class:

 Neutralised

Special Containment Procedures:

 Foundation web crawlers were to monitor UK weather agencies and other media outlets reporting on abnormal weather patterns detected to be as a result of SCP-5361-1, suppressing this information from public view.

SCP-5361-1 was prepared to be contained within a 

corporeal entity containment chamber

 at Site-301, with a Faraday cage constructed around the unit. The activity of SCP-5361-1 was to be monitored at all times. If SCP-5361-1 began to dematerialise, an inbuilt SRA would be activated.

As of 20/6/2021, SCP-5361 and -1 are considered neutralised.

Description:

 SCP-5361 were a series of weather phenomena that occurred based on the emotional state of SCP-5361-1, a humanoid entity, superficially resembling the late Doctor Fordham who died on 27/5/2021.

SCP-5361-1 produced an intermittent antimemetic effect on subjects viewing it and would manifest at a variable time at a variable location within the UK before beginning to wander without direction. After travelling for roughly 2 hours, SCP-5361-1 would dematerialise. SCP-5361-1 was not affected by outside stimuli, capable of walking through solid surfaces and would ignore any attempts at communication.

As of 20/6/2021 SCP-5361-1 has yet to manifest again.

Addendum.1:

 Below are a series of text messages between Doctor Roberts and the late Doctor Fordham.

 Hmmm I wonder what?

Dr. Fordham

:

 Ah yes

Dr. Fordham

:

 When I first asked you out

Dr. Fordham

:

 Good times

Dr. Roberts

:

 I still reminisce about the old days

Dr. Roberts

:

 When things were much simpler

Dr. Fordham

:

 I miss them as well

Dr. Fordham

:

 But the promotion allowed us to buy that new house we always wanted

 Opened up a lot of doors as well

Dr. Roberts

:

 Yay

Dr. Roberts

:

 Coming back home today just in time for your birthday

Dr. Roberts

:

 I brought you your favourite

27/05/2021 at 12:29

Dr. Roberts

:

 Hey?

Dr. Roberts

:

 So when are you back home?

Dr. Fordham

:

 Something's come up

Dr. Roberts

:

 ?

Dr. Fordham

:

 Well Simon said that there's a potential promotion up for grabs if I decide to stay a little longer

Dr. Roberts

:

 What do you mean by staying a little longer?

Dr. Fordham

:

 Well there is the whole tracking, observing and studying stuff and then all the paperwork has to be entered onto the database

Dr. Fordham

:

 It's a very tedious process, but you get the extra money and it could lead to a higher paying position

Dr. Roberts

:

 Is this not a steady enough job for you at the moment

Dr. Roberts

:

 You might not even get it and it will just be more time wasted, when you could be home

Dr. Fordham

:

 We could always use the extra money

Dr. Fordham

:

 Go on that holiday we always wanted

Dr. Fordham

:

 Get a new car and stuff like that with the job

Dr. Roberts

:

 That's all well and good

Dr. Roberts

:

 But is it all worth it if you're always away on some research trip and never here

Dr. Roberts

:

 It would be nice to finally spend a bit of time together

Dr. Fordham

:

 We can have all the time in the world

Dr. Fordham

:

 It's just that moving up the ranks would benefit us

Dr. Fordham

:

 Just imagine

Dr. Roberts

:

 When will it stop though

Dr. Fordham

:

 I though this is what you wanted

Dr. Fordham

:

 A stable job

Dr. Fordham

:

 Money for us

Dr. Fordham

:

 I'm doing this for us

Dr. Roberts

:

 But what's the point if we can't enjoy our life together

Dr. Roberts

:

 It's always about work

Dr. Roberts

:

 Ever since we first got together

Dr. Fordham

:

 It's just another week or so

Dr. Roberts

:

 Yes, but when will it end

Dr. Roberts

:

 Every time you come home from your latest trip out of the country

Dr. Roberts

:

 You're immediately off the next day to some other place

Dr. Fordham

:

 I'm trying okay

Dr. Fordham

:

 Balancing this job and still having time for us is frustrating

Dr. Fordham

:

 I just want to get it over and done with so things can go back to being about us

Dr. Fordham

:

 Is that not what you wanted? For us to be happy

Dr. Roberts

:

 Is that what you want Jeffery?

Dr. Fordham

:

 Well

Dr. Fordham

:

 It's complicated

Dr. Roberts

:

 You're tiring yourself out for a job that you're not happy with

Dr. Fordham

:

 Who says I'm not happy

Dr. Fordham

:

 I'm happy because in the end it will all be worth it

Dr. Fordham

:

 To live our best lives together

Dr. Roberts

:

 I think we need to figure out what's important to the both of us

Dr. Roberts

:

 This relationship

Dr. Roberts

:

 Or our work lives

Dr. Fordham

:

 I mean what did you think this job would do?

Dr. Roberts

:

 I had never really thought it through

Dr. Fordham

:

 Why?

Dr. Fordham

:

 Because you didn't think it would be successful

Dr. Roberts

:

 No

Dr. Roberts

:

 Because I didn't think that it would mean you'd be away for so long

Dr. Fordham

:

 Do you not think I can get the promotion or something

Dr. Roberts

:

 It's not like that

Dr. Roberts

:

 I just don't want you to be disappointed in yourself again like last time

Dr. Fordham

:

 What happened last time won't happen again

Dr. Fordham

:

 You can trust me

Dr. Fordham

:

 Just a little more time for what's most important to me right now

Dr. Roberts

:

 I think the both of us need a break from it all

Dr. Roberts

:

 Figure out this whole life thing if we want to keep this relationship going

Dr. Roberts

:

 I'm going to stay round my sister's for a bit

Dr. Roberts

:

 I can't stand being in this house alone without you

Dr. Fordham

:

 Hey?

27/05/2021 at 12:31

Dr. Fordham

:

 Hey

Dr. Fordham

:

 I didn't mean it like that

27/05/2021 at 12:34

Dr. Fordham

:

 Hey?

Dr. Fordham

:

 You there?

27/05/2021 at 12:37

Dr. Fordham

:

 I don't need this right now ok

Dr. Fordham

:

 I'm stressed

Dr. Fordham

:

 See you in a couple days then

Dr. Fordham

:

 Goodbye

Roughly 2 hours later, Doctor Fordham was killed during a head on collision after the Foundation vehicle swerved off the road and hit a civilian vehicle. Doctor Fordham was situated in the front passenger seat.

Upon hearing what had occured, Doctor Roberts was allowed a week off work for grieving purposes.

Addendum.2:

 Roughly 2 weeks after its discovery, Doctor Roberts was informed about the manifestation of SCP-5361-1. Doctor Roberts applied for a test to be conducted on SCP-5361-1. This application was approved.

Date:

 20/6/2021

Procedure:

 Dr. Roberts would make contact with SCP-5361-1 and attempt to communicate with the entity.

Purpose:

 To test whether SCP-5361-1 will react when presented with a person of interest from Dr. Fordham's life.

Results:

 While SCP-5361-1 had begun to walk down an alley, Dr. Roberts rounded the corner and stood in front of SCP-5361-1. SCP-5361-1 proceeded to tilt its head downwards to observe Dr. Roberts, before they both embraced each other in a hug. SCP-5361-1 then proceeded to dematerialise.

Note:

 After a prolonged absence of SCP-5361-1 once the test had concluded, the item was reclassified as neutralised.
