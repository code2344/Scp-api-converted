SCP-7260 awaiting a walk.
**Object Class:** Safe
**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7260 is currently contained in an unfurnished standard containment chamber. Personnel are to escort the entity to the Site-16 D-Class exercise yard and allow it to walk for 30-45 minutes once daily.
**Description:** SCP-7260 is a pair of size thirteen hiking boots. They are capable of movement and possess a degree of sentience. SCP-7260 will respond to words and phrases such as 'Stay', 'Go', 'Come', 'Walk'[1](javascript:;), and 'Daisy.' The entity has been observed to engage in what is believed to be 'play behavior' with assigned personnel, in which SCP-7260 will nonviolently kick objects it is presented with.
**Discovery:** SCP-7260 was discovered on 07/26/1994 at the Maroon Bells hiking trail. The Foundation was alerted of SCP-7260's presence following reports of a 'pair of ambulatory boots' approaching civilians along the trail. The dispatched recovery team located SCP-7260 and followed the entity to a secluded ravine, where the remains of a barefoot male hiker[2](javascript:;) and canine[3](javascript:;) were discovered.
Mulls was found to have suffered several bone fractures and a concussion prior to expiring, likely caused by an accidental slip or equipment failure. Autopsies reveal that Mulls expired from his injuries while the canine expired due to dehydration.
