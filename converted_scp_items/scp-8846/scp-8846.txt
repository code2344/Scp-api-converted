Item #:

 SCP-8846

Object Class:

 None

1

Special Containment Procedures:

 SCP-8846 must not be used.

In the event SCP-8846 becomes used, the NARCISSUS Protocol is to be enacted.

Description:

SCP-8846 is the unsupported classification within the Anomaly Classification System (ACS) 'Aconcentra', a shorthand for the class 'Pending/Concentra'.

The ACS, by design, is capable of supporting an interaction between any two classifications, even contradictory ones

2

. SCP-8846 is one of few known exceptions to this.

Should SCP-8846 become used, it will corrupt any files classified under it due to emergent behavior from the 'Pending/Concentra' classification. As 'Pending' refers to anomalies which have not yet been classified, and 'Concentra' refers to anomalies affecting recursive phenomenon, the ACS assumes that the item cannot be classified until recursive behavior occurs

3

, and that recursive behavior will not occur until the item is classified

4

. This definition is in itself recursive, and the ACS cannot compensate for it, invariably resulting in file corruption.

Addendum: NARCISSUS Protocol

The NARCISSUS protocol is comprised of two steps: Identification, and Activation.

Identification involves finding a suitable center for the protocol. Suitable centers must possess the following characteristics:

Having been diagnosed with narcissistic personality disorder by a medical professional. This diagnosis must have been sustained over no less than 30 months.

Having no more than 3 close friends.

Having no extant family.

Having no large public footprint, nor any successful internet endeavors

5

.

This individual must then be designated 'POI-8846'.

Activation involves the interaction of POI-8846 and an anomaly classified under SCP-8846. Following or during Identification, POI-8846 will have become the essophysical

6

 embodiment of being 'self-centered'. Both geometrically and ontologically, POI-8846's center will be themself. From this point on, any interaction with POI-8846's center will inherently be recursive

7

.

POI-8846's center is to interact with the anomaly classified under SCP-8846. Due to the recursive nature of this interaction, the anomaly will technically become related to recursive phenomenon and be classified as 'Concentra'. SCP-8846 will no longer be used.

Should POI-8846 survive the interaction, they are to be amnesticized and returned to their prior life. The POI-8846 designation is to be rendered null.

Footnotes

1

. ACS class definitions cannot use ACS classes.

2

. IE. Thaumiel/Apollyon.

3

. Per the definition of 'Pending'.

4

. Per the definition of 'Concentra' as a subclass.

5

. IE. An account on a social media platform with a large number of 'followers'.

6

. The study of tangible concepts.

7

. As is any interaction in which an element contains itself as a nested sub element.
