Reports of anomalous phenomena caused by SCP-6926 are to be tracked and witnesses are to be amnesticized appropriately.
**Description:** SCP-6926 is a humanoid entity resembling a balding, elderly male with a short white beard. SCP-6926 always appears dressed in a manner somewhat resembling traditional depictions of Santa Claus, with additional articles of clothing worn in cold weather.
Areas within a twenty-five mile radius of SCP-6926 experience the following phenomena:
**Environmental:**
  * Decrease in local temperatures; enough to sustain the presence of ice and snow.
  * The appearance of partially drunk alcoholic beverages within local homes.

**Phenomena displayed in humans:**
  * Increased fatigue and idleness. Often causing subjects to remain sleeping longer than usual.
  * The inability to keep track of time consistently throughout the day.
  * Severe headaches in subjects that drank alcohol the previous day, no matter how minimal the amount consumed.
  * Feelings of melancholy and regret (Reasons vary between subjects).

Additionally, SCP-6926 has displayed various anomalous abilities, including instant teleportation between locations, manipulation and control of ice and snow, inducing alcoholic intoxication through physical contact, and the manifestation of holiday themed/related beverages (Eggnog, Irish-cream, Coca-Cola). SCP-6926 only uses these abilities to aid itself in its annual activities.
SCP-6926 manifests annually on the 26th of December in countries that celebrate the holiday “Boxing Day”. During such times SCP-6926 will travel between locations that have hosted social gatherings the night prior, specifically those containing uneaten foodstuffs and beverages leftover from the night before. While there, SCP-6926 will take part in recreational activities such as drinking, eating, and general relaxation. SCP-6926 will de-manifest at 12:00am local time on December 27th.
**Discovery Log:** Local phenomena resulting from SCP-6926’s anomalous properties were first detected in the village of ██████, England, on December 26th 1995. Due to the sudden drastic change in local weather, Foundation agents in the area were dispatched to investigate. SCP-6926 was discovered traveling between pubs in the area, joined by civilians partaking in a pub-crawl that had begun the previous night. Interviews with witnesses revealed SCP-6926 had become heavily intoxicated over the night, during which they made various references to a confidential event that took place on [September 22nd the same year](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5925).
**Interview Log:** The following is an improvised interview that was recorded following SCP-6926’s sudden manifestation at Site-17’s annual employee boxing day gathering in 1996.
> _Foundation personnel can be heard talking to one another over the sound of music. The room goes silent and the music stops, as personnel notice the presence of SCP-6926. Loud crunching can be heard from SCP-6926. Researcher Agnew approaches._
> **Researcher Agnew:** Wow. Um, excuse me? Who’re you?
> **SCP-6926:** Hi. What’s up? I’m Santa Claus.
> **Researcher Agnew:** Yeah… Um, what are you doing here?
> _SCP-6926 continues eating cookies_
> **SCP-6926:** Eating right now.
> **Researcher Agnew:** Right. Any particular reason you’re here though?
> **SCP-6926:** Food. You want some?
> **Researcher Agnew:** No thanks. _Researcher Agnew gestures to personnel to alert security._
> **Researcher Agnew:** So you’re Saint Nick then?
> **SCP-6926:** No. I’m Santa Claus. Well, not today at least. It’s my day off.
> **Researcher Agnew:** You don’t seem quite jolly enough to be Santa Claus.
> _SCP-6926 picks up a can of coke and notices that it is warm. Frost forms around the can and SCP-6926 smiles._
> **SCP-6926:** I don’t care.
> **Researcher Agnew:** You know, it’s strange. When I was a kid, I didn’t believe in Santa.
> _SCP-6926 looks at researcher Agnew. SCP-6926 takes a sip of coke._
> **SCP-6926:** You’re an idiot.
> **Researcher Agnew:** Any other business?
> **SCP-6926:** Probably finish off here. Go someplace else. You’re kinda bringing down the mood here buddy.
> _Security personnel enter the room and approach SCP-6926. Both restrain SCP-6926 and escort them into the hallway. Shortly afterwards, both security personnel begin to stupor and suddenly collapse onto the floor. SCP-6926 re-enters the room._
> **Researcher Agnew:** Hey! What’re you-
> _SCP-6926 grabs a bottle of whisky from a nearby table._
> **SCP-6926:** Haha. Lightweights.
> _SCP-6926 disappears_
