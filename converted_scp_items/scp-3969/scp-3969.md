SCP-3969 upon capture
**Item #:** SCP-3969
**Object Class:** Safe
**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-3969 is to be housed in a standard humanoid containment chamber at Site-17. No further containment procedures have been deemed necessary at this time.
**Description:** SCP-3969 is a middle-aged human male of Irish-American descent. SCP-3969's primary anomalous property appears to render it invulnerable to numerous forms of injury, disease, and aging — although whether SCP-3969 is entirely impervious to these ailments or merely resistant to them remains unclear.
SCP-3969 claims to have acquired its anomalous properties through an extensive thaumaturgic ritual involving "consuming 138 fermented lima beans a day", "bathing in the blood of a blind coyote", and [DATA EXPUNGED]. Investigation of these claims is ongoing.
SCP-3969 first came to the attention of Foundation personnel in Seattle, Washington, following reports of a local derelict falling from the roof of a seven-story apartment building and emerging unscathed. Upon confirmation of its anomalous abilities, SCP-3969 was detained and transported to Site-17 for questioning.
A transcript of this interview, conducted by Dr. Phillip Grant, has been attached to this file below.
**Addendum 1:** First interview
> **Date:** 9/16/2008  
>    
>  **Objective:** Ascertain the source of SCP-3969's anomalous properties.
> * * *
> **[BEGIN LOG]**  
>    
>  **SCP-3969:** I always knew this would happen.  
>    
>  **Dr. Grant:** What do you mean?  
>    
>  **SCP-3969:** Nothing. Just some black-suited government bastards swooping in and putting me in a place like this. So what next, Doc? You wanna probe my esophagus?  
>    
>  _Dr. Grant laughs._  
>    
>  **Dr. Grant:** Well, I can't speak to what they'll do to you—  
>    
>  _Dr. Grant gestures to the other research staff outside the room._  
>    
>  **Dr. Grant:** —but I'm just here to ask you some questions. Mainly, how you ended up in your current… ah, predicament?  
>    
>  **SCP-3969:** You know, I can't say I'm too _sure_ , considering your friend over there gave me enough downers to sedate an elephant for a month.  
>    
>  **Dr. Grant:** I was referring to your invulnerability.  
>    
>  _Silence._  
>    
>  **SCP-3969:** I sold my soul to Satan.  
>    
>  **Dr. Grant:** Sarcasm doesn't help either of us.  
>    
>  **SCP-3969:** Sarcasm? _Sarcasm_? I'll show you sarcasm, you condescending sack of shit—  
>    
>  _SCP-3969 violently gestures to Dr. Grant, before appearing to notice the presence of two security guards outside of the conference room._  
>    
>  **SCP-3969:** _Tch._ Like I'd show some disgruntled laymen my legumes.  
>    
>  **Dr. Grant:** Your… what?  
>    
>  **[END LOG]**

**Addendum 2:** Second interview
Three days after its first interview, after previously remaining uncooperative, SCP-3969 requested to speak with Dr. Grant in an apparent desire to "negotiate". The following meeting was arranged shortly thereafter, and is transcribed verbatim.

> **[BEGIN LOG]**  
>    
>  **Dr. Grant:** I understand you wish to cooperate.  
>    
>  **SCP-3969:** You really wanna know my secret?  
>    
>  _Dr. Grant chuckles._  
>    
>  **Dr. Grant:** If that's how you'd like to put it.  
>    
>  **SCP-3969:** Then fine. But I have some conditions.  
>    
>  **Dr. Grant:** Which would be?  
>    
>  **SCP-3969:** Getting to see the sun for more than five minutes a day would be nice.  
>    
>  _Dr. Grant sighs._  
>    
>  **Dr. Grant:** If you are unsatisfied with the accommodations you've been provided, I will put in a request with—  
>    
>  **SCP-3969:** You call a lightless metal cell "accommodations"?  
>    
>  _Silence._  
>    
>  **Dr. Grant:** I'll see what I can do.  
>    
>  **SCP-3969:** Good. Now for my end. Got a pen?  
>    
>  _[FOUR HOURS OF EXTRANEOUS DIALOGUE REMOVED]_  
>    
>  **SCP-3969:** Three hundred and twenty-seven of them, to be exact. And it has to be in one sitting.  
>    
>  **Dr. Grant:** Is that before or after the radish stems?  
>    
>  **SCP-3969:** It doesn't matter, as long as you soaked it in lamb's blood for exactly 6 hours. But make sure not to boil them for too long, or you'll have to start from scratch.  
>    
>  _Dr. Grant appears to write something down._  
>    
>  **Dr. Grant:** Is that everything?  
>    
>  **SCP-3969:** Yup.  
>    
>  **Dr. Grant:** And this won't carry any… unanticipated side affects?  
>    
>  **SCP-3969:** Besides getting beaten up and abducted? No. Not that I know of.  
>    
>  _Dr. Grant stands up, and folds the papers in front of him._  
>    
>  **Dr. Grant:** Thank you, SCP-3969. Your cooperation has been duly noted. Expect changes in the weeks to come.  
>    
>  **[END LOG]**
_Excellent work, Dr. Grant. Please submit yourself to your nearest human resources office for voluntary amnesticization. We'll take it from here. —[DATA EXPUNGED]_

>    
>  **O5-7:** Yeah, _seven_ barrels of carp? Ridiculous.  
>    
>  **O5-9:** The supplements should stop the worst of it — cyanide poisoning and such. Now we just have to wait.  
>    
>  **O5-4:** `YOU'RE ALL ANIMALS`.

>  **O5-1:** I think it was… let me see.  
>    
>  _The sound of shuffling papers can be heard._  
>    
>  **O5-1:** Around three hours? Thaumaturgy has never been a very exact science. Or, well — a science.  
>    
>  **O5-9:** Actually, I think I can feel it kicking in right now.

>  **O5-12:** What was that?  
>    
>  _O5-6 enters the room, appearing noticeably older than moments earlier._  
>    
>  **O5-12:** Christ! What the hell happened to you, Jason?  
>    
>  **O5-6:** _(Hoarse)_ I… I… I—  
>    
>  _O5-6 bursts into dust._  
>    
>  **O5-9:** Oh no.  
>    
>  _Sounds of falling debris, wounds fissuring, and screams can be heard for the next fifteen minutes, followed by silence._  
>    
>  **O5-4:** `GUYS?`  
>    
>  _Silence. A phone is dialing._  
>    
>  **O5-4:** `BERTRAND?`

Following this incident, Site-17 staff attempted to consult SCP-3969 — but upon entering its containment chamber, were greeted only with a single word crudely etched into a nearby wall:
> SUCKERS.
