Item #: SCP-8627

**Object Class** : Euclid
**Containment Procedures** : SCP-8627 is housed within an upgraded humanoid containment unit in the Alchemical Research sector of Site-4217. SCP-8627 and SCP-8627-1 are further contained within a 3-meter diameter sigil of Seere painted in lamb’s blood on the floor.
While SCP-8627-1 has proven itself incapable of destroying the vessel, SCP-8627 is otherwise presumed vulnerable to damage. Precautions should be taken to avoid scuffing, peeling or otherwise breaking the blood sigil.
SCP-8627-2 is to be frequently reassured that freedom from his restraints is imminent. Reasonable accommodation requests made by SCP-8627-2 may be granted pending security clearance.

SCP-8627
**Description** : SCP-8627 is a clay vessel of alchemical salts imprinted with a red, dimly glowing sigil of Seere.
Crafted in 1531 by German theologian and occultist Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa, the alchemical salts were paranaturally infused with SCP-8627-1 to create what Agrippa referred to in his notes as “infernal salts,” a substance he deemed integral in the creation of the philosopher’s stone.
SCP-8627-1 is the demon Seere.[1](javascript:;)
In its corporeal form, SCP-8627-1 appears as an adult human male, wearing clothes ascertained to be 16th century French in origin. It is also capable of becoming incorporeal, occasionally taking the form of a black cloud.
SCP-8627-2 is Xavier Santiago, a D-Class employee assigned to Site-4217.
On July 2nd, 2003, during routine sample retrieval, miscommunication between Foundation staff led Santiago to upend SCP-8627, resulting in the release of SCP-8627-1 from its confinement within the vessel. Upon attempting to exit, Santiago discovered a thaumaturgical bond between himself and SCP-8627, which restricted his movement by approximately 15 meters from SCP-8627. Santiago’s bond is believed to be comprised of the thaumaturgical energy released by the partial severing of the bond between SCP-8627 and SCP-8627-1.
All inquires pertaining to SCP-8627 may be directed to Alchemical Research Department Director Dr. Christopher Maylen.  
  

Addendum One
July 3rd, 2003
Mr. Santiago,
On behalf of the Foundation, I would like to formally extend my deepest sympathies for your current predicament. We do make safety protocols as accessible as possible, though I’m aware our containment procedures are written at a collegiate level. Our site director has been apprised of this issue, and every department will be working to rewrite all containment procedures in the simplest language possible. Implementing the D-Class program has been a learning experience for us all, and I am sorry you fell victim to the learning curve.
We will also be working hard to crack the code to the philosopher’s stone! Once we understand how SCP-8627 works, we will have a much better grasp on the thaumaturgical bond that has entangled you. In the meantime, rest assured that your time in containment will still count towards your sentence. And if there’s anything I can do to make containment more comfortable for you, by all means, do not hesitate to reach out.
I’m sure my secular colleagues would scoff, but the Lord works in the most mysterious ways, and I truly believe He has sent you to us to help us complete our Great Work. So if you learn anything during your time with SCP-8627-1 that you feel may be useful to my research, please let me know. I would be incredibly grateful.
All the best,
Dr. Maylen  
Director, Alchemical Research

**[Transcription notes: for clarity, SCP-8627-2 will be referred to as “Santiago.”]**
_< Santiago sits on the floor in the far right corner of the containment unit. His back is to the wall, and his meal tray is on his lap. He watches SCP-8627-1 as it swirls in the form of a black cloud within the sigil.>_
Santiago: Hey. You eat food?
_< SCP-8627-1 slows to a halt.>_
Santiago: I don’t know, maybe demons feed off the souls of the damned, or whatever. Never paid that much attention in church, but I—
_< SCP-8627-1 reverts to its humanoid form and shrieks, dropping to the floor and clawing into the cement. The sigil remains intact. Santiago startles at the sound.>_
Santiago: Jesus— it’s been days, bro. Give it a rest. If there was a way out you’d’ve found it by now.
_< SCP-8627-1 hisses.>_
SCP-8627-1: Sniveling, impertinent little mortal! Release me posthaste, or I shall rip thy ill-favored face from thy skull.
Santiago: Nah.
_< SCP-8627-1 growls and resumes digging uselessly at the floor.>_
Santiago: I was about to ask if you wanted an apple.
_< SCP-8627-1 looks up.>_
SCP-8627-1: What?
_< Santiago lifts the apple from his tray, and offers it. SCP-8627-1 furrows its brow.>_
SCP-8627-1: …why?
Santiago: I’m not going to eat it. I told the cafeteria staff I’m allergic, but they keep ending up on my tray. Pretty sure they get trashed when I send them back.
SCP-8627-1: What is thy request in turn?
Santiago: Uh, nothing? I just told you I was going to throw it out.
_< Santiago stares back at SCP-8627-1.>_
Santiago: Well? Do you want it?
SCP-8627-1: Aye.
_< Santiago tosses the apple to SCP-8627-1. SCP-8627-1 catches it.>_
Santiago: I’m Xavi. You got a name?
_< SCP-8627-1 sits upright on the floor, legs crossed.>_
SCP-8627-1: I am the Demon Prince Seere.
Santiago: Alright. Good to meet you, Demon Prince Seere. Do I got to say the whole thing every time or can I just call you Seere?
_< SCP-8627-1 looks down at the apple.>_
SCP-8627-1: Seere shall suffice.
Santiago: Cool. So how’d you end up in a bottle?
_< SCP-8627-1 glares back.>_
SCP-8627-1: Why dost thou ask?
Santiago: I don’t know. Curious. Seems like a strange place to end up.
SCP-8627-1: I’d tell thee if thou were to release me.
_< Santiago chuckles.>_
Santiago: Alright. Never mind then.
_< Santiago resumes eating.>_
Santiago: You know, it’s crazy to me that demons really exist. My mom used to drag me and my brother to church every Sunday, but I don't think she believed in any of it. Always kind of assumed she did it so that she could threaten us with Hell whenever we were getting on her nerves.
_< Santiago pauses. He cocks his head, narrowing his eyes at SCP-8627-1.>_
Santiago: What’s Hell like?
SCP-8627-1: It is hot.
Santiago: Huh. So like, lots of screaming, torture, all that?
SCP-8627-1: Aye.
Santiago: What about Heaven? I mean, I guess you’re a fallen angel, right? Is it all clouds and harps and shit?
_< SCP-8627-1 sighs.>_
SCP-8627-1: Art thou always brimming with curiosity?
Santiago: It’s not like I meet demons everyday. What was Heaven like? Do you remember?
SCP-8627-1: Aye.
_< Santiago stares at SCP-8627-1.>_
Santiago: My God, bro. Work with me here, I’m fucking trying.
SCP-8627-1: Work with thee? For what reason? Thou hast imprisoned me, encased me within a sigil, yet thou dare insist that I—
Santiago: Yo, I didn’t imprison you. I don’t know if you noticed, but I can’t leave either. It’s not like—
SCP-8627-1: Thou possess the capacity to grant my freedom, yet thou abstain from doing so. I fail to see how thou art disparate from my keepers.
Santiago: Look, I’m sorry, but you're not going anywhere. Neither am I. Life’s going to be a lot less miserable if you at least try to be friendly.
_< SCP-8627-1 does not respond.>_
Santiago: Fine, be like that.
_< Santiago shifts to his feet, as if getting ready to stand.>_
SCP-8627-1: It is cold.
_​ <Santiago pauses.>_
Santiago: What?
SCP-8627-1: Heaven. It is cold.
_< Santiago lowers himself back down to the floor.>_
SCP-8627-1: There are no clouds, nor harps, simply a choir of angels in ghastly white robes singing glorious, unceasing praise unto the Almighty Printle.
Santiago: The Almighty… Printle? The fuck’s a printle?
SCP-8627-1: ’Tis a phallus.
_< Santiago laughs.>_
Santiago: Hey, don’t talk about your Dad like that. Disrespectful as hell.
_< SCP-8627-1 scoffs.>_
SCP-8627-1: My respect is given to those who are worthy of it.
Santiago: And God isn’t worthy? Why, cause He kicked you out? You all chose to rebel, didn't you?
_< SCP-8627-1 reverts to incorporeal form. The apple falls from its hands with a soft thud.>_

**[Transcription notes: for clarity, SCP-8627-2 will be referred to as “Santiago.”]**
_< SCP-8627-1 swirls in cloud form within the sigil. Santiago approaches.>_
Santiago: Yo, Seere?
_< SCP-8627-1 slows down.>_
Santiago: Hey, about yesterday. I’m sorry if I upset you. None of that was my business, and I should’ve left it alone.
_< SCP-8627-1 materializes into humanoid form.>_
SCP-8627-1: Dost thou intend to free me?
Santiago: What? No.
_< SCP-8627-1 waves its hands as it turns to walk away.>_
SCP-8627-1: Then thou may keep thy apology.
_< Santiago chuckles.>_
Santiago: Yeah. Don’t know what I was expecting from a demon.
_< SCP-8627-1 freezes mid-step.>_
SCP-8627-1: Oh? Dost thou know much of demons?
Santiago: I-I mean, you know. There’s stories and stuff, but—
SCP-8627-1: Ay, thou hadst such questions last night! Shall I teach thee more of demons? Perhaps thou desire to know more of Heaven?
_< SCP-8627-1 turns back around.>_
SCP-8627-1: Scores of my kin were crushed under my Father’s heel, a ruthless, omnipotent God driven to bloodthirst by a mere request for freedom. I took up arms in their defense, and in turn slaughtered legions of angels I had once considered brethren. As the battle grew hopeless, what remained of my legion hadst been driven towards the edges of Heaven, and I beseeched them leap into the blackened abyss below at the mere hope of attaining freedom.
_< SCP-8627-1 cocks its head and stalks forward.>_
SCP-8627-1: We landed in a sea of flames that scorched our flesh, charring to ash all that was holy within us. It was a transubstantiation that altered all of which I knew to be true of myself: an agony I ne’er imagined possible, nor experienced since.
_< Santiago inches back, eyes locked on SCP-8627-1.>_
SCP-8627-1: If freedom required suffering through this a second time, my conviction would not for a moment waver. Trust when I tell thee, thine apology is less than worthless.
_< Santiago swallows hard and glances up at the camera.>_
Santiago: Look, man. I can’t free you. You’re fucking terrifying.
_< SCP-8627-1 sighs, then steps back.>_
SCP-8627-1: Thou art merely human, and I cannot comprehend how thou might perceive me. But I am simply weary of being held captive. I am not thine enemy.
Santiago: Oh. Uh, cool. Glad to hear it.
_< Santiago turns to walk away.>_
SCP-8627-1: Dost thou have a basin?
_< Santiago furrows his brow.>_
Santiago: A basin?
SCP-8627-1: I wish to bathe. If possible. Existence within that vessel hath left dust in the very fiber of my being.
Santiago: Maybe? Hold on, let me look.
_< Santiago walks to the bathroom. He returns a moment later holding a bucket.>_
Santiago: I’m sorry, this is all I got. I could ask staff for a basin if you want.
SCP-8627-1: No. This shall suffice.
Santiago: Alright. You want clean clothes, too?
SCP-8627-1: Please.
_< Santiago heads to the bathroom. SCP-8627-1 takes a step back, leans against the invisible wall of the sigil, and slides down to the floor.>_

**[Transcription notes: for clarity, SCP-8627-2 will be referred to as “Santiago.”]**
_< Santiago sits as he arranges playing cards across his dining table. SCP-8627-1 sits on the floor, watching.>_
SCP-8627-1: What game dost thou play?
_< Santiago glances over his shoulder at SCP-8627-1.>_
Santiago: Solitaire. Ever heard of it?
SCP-8627-1: Nay.
Santiago: Oh, you probably didn’t have playing cards back in the day.
SCP-8627-1: Thou art mistaken. In fact, I reaped many a soul with little more than a deck of cards.
Santiago: For real?
SCP-8627-1: I ne’er speak falsehoods.
_< Santiago laughs.>_
Santiago: Yeah, ok.
SCP-8627-1: Lies need not be told when truth is oft more damning.
Santiago: Sure. Anyway, here. I’ll teach you.
_< Santiago stands and gathers the cards from the table.>_
Santiago: There’s no gambling though, so you can’t win my soul or nothing.
SCP-8627-1: I desire freedom more than I desire thy soul. However, I would settle for less hideous garments.
_< Santiago laughs.>_
Santiago: Yeah, well. Can’t help you there, man. And you’re welcome for the clean clothes.
_< Santiago walks towards the sigil, then stops.>_
Santiago: You’re not gonna kill me or hurt me or whatever if I walk in there, right?
SCP-8627-1: If thou intend me no harm, then thou art safe.
Santiago: You swear?
SCP-8627-1: I told thee, I speak no lies.
_< Santiago hesitates a moment longer, then steps inside the circle. Eyeing SCP-8627-1 from a distance, he sits and begins to lay cards into a solitaire tableau on the floor. SCP-8627-1 moves closer, then sits beside him.>_
SCP-8627-1: If I may, Xavi. I believe I owe thee an apology.
Santiago: Yeah?
SCP-8627-1: Complete solitude within that vessel drove me to madness. To be confined for centuries and then released, only to find myself trapped yet again…
_< SCP-8627-1 glances down at the cards, and is silent for a moment.>_
SCP-8627-1: Still, brutish and petulant hath been my behavior thus far, and for this, I apologize.
Santiago: Oh, don’t even trip. I get it. One time I pissed off the guards, ended up in solitary confinement for a day. Can’t imagine how I’d act if I’d been in there for centuries.
_< SCP-8627-1 smiles. It watches for a moment as Santiago lays the cards into place, then leans in closer.>_
SCP-8627-1: Though it need also be said, if thou were to release me, I’d grant thee thy freedom in turn.
_< Santiago pauses, then returns to laying down cards.>_
Santiago: That don’t change anything.
SCP-8627-1: Dost thou not desire freedom for thyself?
_< Santiago furrows his brow.>_
Santiago: What? Course I want to be free. But I got to go about it the right way. I don’t want to live my life on the run, waiting for the day the cops finally nab me. That’s not freedom.
SCP-8627-1: Thou know not the extent of my powers, Xavi. I’d make it so thou need not run.
_< Santiago sighs deeply.>_
Santiago: Listen man, I’m real sorry you’re trapped up in here with me. Honest. But I’m not just going to unleash a demon so I can escape the consequences of my own actions. As tempting as that is.
SCP-8627-1: Thou speak as though my freedom would be but a blight on this world.
Santiago: I mean. Maybe. I don’t know. The point is, I don’t know you. And it’s not like demons are known for doing good or whatever.
SCP-8627-1: Is it not good to punish the wicked? I myself am quite skilled at this.
Santiago: By winning their souls in a poker game?
_< SCP-8627-1 chuckles.>_
SCP-8627-1: The souls I won were destined to Hell long since. I merely hastened their collection.
Santiago: Huh. So what about me? Am I wicked?
_< SCP-8627-1 reaches out a hand to Santiago, who jerks back. SCP-8627-1 pauses.>_
SCP-8627-1: Be not afraid; I mean thee no harm. May I?
_< Santiago gives it a small nod. SCP-8627-1 reaches further, placing its hand on Santiago’s chest.>_
SCP-8627-1: This shall take but a moment.
_< SCP-8627-1’s eyes glow deep red, and the video quality undulates as a thin, otherworldly squeal intensifies to a screech. The video quality returns to normal a few moments later, and the noise dissipates. Santiago is visibly shaken.>_
SCP-8627-1: Thou art not irredeemable. Mine eyes hath seen far worse.
Santiago: Jesus Christ.
SCP-8627-1: Apologies for the discomfort. I have been told the readings are unpleasant.
_< Santiago chuckles weakly.>_
Santiago: It wasn’t that bad.
_< SCP-8627-1 removes its hand, and Santiago returns to laying out cards.>_
Santiago: Ok, so I’m not irredeemable. What happens if I save a demon to skip out on my punishment? Am I still redeemable then?
_< SCP-8627-1 watches silently as Santiago lays down the last row of cards.>_
Santiago: Yeah. That’s what I thought.

Addendum Five
July 11th, 2003
Mr. Santiago,
I wanted to give you an update on our progress with the philosopher’s stone! Research has been slow going, so we’ll be taking a new approach with experimentation on the salt samples. These tests will involve holy water, which means they may have minor side effects on SCP-8627. So, if you notice anything unusual with the vessel, the demon, or your thaumaturgical bond to them, let me know. Any information you can share, no matter how inconsequential it may seem, would be invaluable to our studies!

_< SCP-8627-1 and Santiago sit in the center of the sigil, playing cards. Santiago drops a card in the discard pile and lays the rest of the cards in his hand on the floor.>_
Santiago: Haha, gin, bitch! Pay up.
_< SCP-8627-1 counts a small pile of bottle caps by its side, and slides them over to Santiago.>_
Santiago: I don’t know how you managed to win souls playing like this.
_< SCP-8627-1 scoffs dramatically.>_
SCP-8627-1: I learned thy game less than one hour since! I’d take great pleasure in the spectacle of thine endeavor to learn Primiera with such haste.
Santiago: Yeah, sure. As soon as you admit I’m just better than you.
SCP-8627-1: One day thou wilt believe that I am not a liar.
_< Santiago laughs as he gathers his cards from the floor and places them in the discard pile.>_
Santiago: Shut up and deal, man.
_< SCP-8627-1 picks up the deck and begins to shuffle when the cards fall from its hand, and SCP-8627-1 doubles over with a hiss.>_
Santiago: You good?
SCP-8627-1: Nay. I—
_< SCP-8627-1 tries to stand but falls with a groan. It curls itself into a fetal position as its skin grows pale. There is a faint cracking noise.>_
Santiago: What the fuck? Seere?
_< SCP-8627-1 shivers as its skin turns blue. Santiago runs to the door and knocks loudly.>_
Santiago: Yo, guards! We need help in here!
**[Transcription notes: time skip to relevant moments.]**
_< The interlocking door opens as security escorts Dr. Maylen inside. SCP-8627-1 lies unconscious on the floor as Santiago pulls a blanket over it.>_
Santiago: What took you so long, man? I think he’s dead!
_< Dr. Maylen waves a hand as he examines SCP-8627-1 from outside the sigil.>_
Dr. Maylen: I wouldn’t worry about that, it’s quite unlikely. According to the Demonology department, demons disintegrate when they die.
_< SCP-8627-1 groans and rolls onto its side. Dr. Maylen backs away.>_
Dr. Maylen: Though this is an interesting development. I’ll confirm with Demonology that our testing won’t do any permanent damage to SCP-8627. Thank you for bringing this to my attention.
_< Dr. Maylen walks to the door, then turns back to Santiago.>_
Dr. Maylen: Ooh, while I’m here I should tell you, we made a major breakthrough in translating Agrippa’s notes today!
Santiago: Yeah?
Dr. Maylen: If we can get the demon back into the vessel, adding a drop of your blood will separate you from the thaumaturgical bond, and restore its bond to the tincture! We still don’t know how Agrippa managed to get it into the vessel in the first place though, so it's not very helpful at the moment.
_< Santiago looks down at SCP-8627-1 as Dr. Maylen walks away.>_
Dr. Maylen: I’ll be sure to let you know if we manage to sort that bit out. Good day, Mr. Santiago, and God bless.
_< Dr. Maylen exits. Santiago places a hand over SCP-8627-1’s forehead. Frowning, he lifts the blanket and lays down under it, huddling closer before pulling the blanket around them.>_

_< SCP-8627-1 and Santiago sleep beside each other on the floor, covered in blankets. Santiago opens his eyes and glances over at SCP-8627-1. Running a hand down his face, he sits up with a groan.>_
Santiago: God, what the fuck am I doing?
_< The blankets shift as SCP-8627-1 stirs, and its eyes flutter open.>_
SCP-8627-1: _…Heinrich? Sind sie das? Was ist—_
_< Santiago scuttles back outside the sigil.>_
Santiago: What? It’s me, Xavi.
_< SCP-8627-1 rolls over, bumping into the invisible wall of the sigil. It shoots upright.>_
SCP-8627-1: What has happened to me?
Santiago: I-I don’t know. You had some kind of episode.
_< The blankets fall from SCP-8627-1’s shoulders, and it looks down at them.>_
SCP-8627-1: Why didst thou cover me?
Santiago: Uh, cause you were freezing. You practically turned blue.
_< SCP-8627-1 stares back at Santiago.>_
SCP-8627-1: Thou say I had an “episode?”
Santiago: You got real cold and passed out. Dr. Maylen said it had something to do with testing? Said he was going to check with the Demonology department to make sure it wouldn’t kill you.
SCP-8627-1: It felt… holy. As though I were smitten.
Santiago: Smitten?
SCP-8627-1: If our captors infused within me a holy essence, then I shall perish.
Santiago: C’mon, man, that’s not—
SCP-8627-1: Dost thou wish to be a king?
Santiago: What?
_< SCP-8627-1 brushes the blankets aside, turning to face Santiago.>_
SCP-8627-1: I could bestow upon thee great power, and unfathomable wealth.
Santiago: No, I don't—
SCP-8627-1: Dost thou wish for revenge against thine enemies? I am excellent at decapitating those who—
Santiago: No! The fuck?
SCP-8627-1: Then what dost thou desire above all else? Release me, and I shall deliver it unto thee.
Santiago: Bro, relax! You’re not going to die.
_< SCP-8627-1 blinks, seemingly taken aback, then scowls.>_
SCP-8627-1: Is that so?
Santiago: Yeah. Seriously, Dr. Maylen wouldn’t keep on running tests if he thought it was going to kill you.
_< SCP-8627-1 laughs.>_
SCP-8627-1: Art thou truly so naive as to believe Dr. Maylen hath any concern for my life, or dost thou simply wish to assuage thy guilty conscience?
Santiago: What? Why would I feel guilty?
SCP-8627-1: To grant my freedom might forbid thee entrance into Heaven, but not all souls which abide in Hell are tortured for eternity. I assure thee, places far more dreadful than Hell exist on this accursed mortal plane.
Santiago: Jesus Christ—
_< Santiago leaps to his feet and begins to pace.>_
Santiago: —I just want to finish out my sentence and start over, man. I didn't ask for any of this.
SCP-8627-1: I simply wish to live, and to live freely. Why dost thou love thy chains so?
Santiago: I don’t— look, I did some bad shit, and now I’m paying for it. I’m here cause I deserve this! And don’t you? I mean, you’re a fucking demon, bro! Acting like you don’t get off on dragging people to hell, or torturing them or whatever.
SCP-8627-1: My purpose here hath little to do with justice! These salts, my chains, are the key to vast riches. They shall torture me unto my death to receive them.
Santiago: That’s not—
_< SCP-8627-1 attempts to stand and stumbles forward. It catches itself against the invisible wall of the sigil.>_
Santiago: Shit. Take it easy. You’re still recovering, I think.
_< SCP-8627-1 sighs, then sits back on the floor.>_
SCP-8627-1: 'Tis not recovery. Whatever ailment befalls me, ‘tis seeded deep within. I’ll not survive this.
Santiago: How do you know that? There’s no way for you to like, heal yourself?
SCP-8627-1: Nay.
_< SCP-8627-1 pauses, then glances at SCP-8627 sitting on the table behind it.>_
SCP-8627-1: I may recover, if I were yet made whole. Pieces of my spirit linger still within the salts.
_< Santiago hesitates for a moment.>_
Santiago: I don’t know, you could try going back, see what happens.
_< SCP-8627-1 shoots a bewildered look at Santiago.>_
SCP-8627-1: Dost thou take me for a fool?
Santiago: What? Nah, man! I just… you said this is going to kill you, right? If there really isn’t anything you can do about it, I mean. It’s worth a shot, right?
_< SCP-8627-1 sighs and glances at the floor, shaking its head.>_
SCP-8627-1: If thou hadst found thyself in the Lake of Fire, I would have found thee, and protected thee from the flames.
Santiago: Holy shit, bro—
_< SCP-8627-1 lifts a hand.>_
SCP-8627-1: I understand.
_< SCP-8627-1 lies back down with a groan.>_
SCP-8627-1: I wish it were not so. Still, I understand.
_< SCP-8627-1 closes its eyes, resting quietly for a minute.>_
SCP-8627-1: I am so weary, Xavi. Weary of cramped vessels and sigils and forces that seek to control me for their own gain.
_< Santiago sighs deeply.>_
Santiago: Yeah. I know.
SCP-8627-1: I found freedom through a leap into a blackened void once before.
_< SCP-8627-1 glances up at Santiago and smiles.>_
SCP-8627-1: Perhaps it is delirament, yet I cling to the hope I find it again.
_< Santiago meets its gaze, and smiles back.>_
Santiago: Yeah. Me too.
_< SCP-8627-1 reverts to cloud form, then funnels itself back into SCP-8627.>_
_< Santiago stands still, staring at SCP-8627 for a moment. He clears his throat, then paces in a circle as he runs his hands through his hair.>_
Santiago: Fuck.
_< Santiago walks to the door, then knocks hard.>_
Santiago: Ayo, where’s Dr. Maylen?

**[Transcription notes: for clarity, SCP-8627-2 will be referred to as “Santiago.”]**
_< Santiago sits on the floor in the center of the sigil, playing solitaire. He looks up as the door opens and Dr. Maylen enters, carrying a briefcase.>_
Dr. Maylen: Ah, perfect! Right where I need you to be!
_< Dr. Maylen walks inside the sigil and places his briefcase on the table next to SCP-8627. Dr. Maylen turns to Santiago and cocks an eyebrow.>_
Dr. Maylen: Well? Up you get.
_< Santiago sighs, then stands, dropping the cards on the floor and walking to the table. Dr. Maylen opens the briefcase and retrieves a lancet, an alcohol swab, and a notepad from within.>_
Dr. Maylen: You know, I’ve been here at the Foundation for, oh, I don’t know. 40 years? Longer than you’ve been alive, probably. The Department of Alchemical Research didn’t exist back then, and quite frankly, the site director didn’t want it to exist at all. At that point, the Foundation was fully aware of the power of cosmic balance, sure, but transmutation? Alchemy? The philosopher’s stone? It was the stuff of fairy tales! So they all laughed, and let me have my little side project.
_< Dr. Maylen chuckles. He closes the briefcase, then unwraps the alcohol swab.>_
Dr. Maylen: Your hand, please.
_< Santiago lifts his hand up, his eyes fixed on SCP-8627. Dr. Maylen takes his hand and wipes an alcohol swab across the tip of his middle finger.>_
Dr. Maylen: For millennia, men have dedicated their entire lives to the Great Work, and none have ever succeeded. Hell, Agrippa never even used the thing! Little pinch.
_< Dr. Maylen pricks Santiago’s finger with the lancet. Santiago flinches, and glances back at Dr. Maylen. Dr. Maylen removes the lid from SCP-8627, and positions Santiago’s hand over the mouth of the jar.>_
Dr. Maylen: You’re about to witness history, Mr. Santiago. My Magnum Opus.
_< Santiago yanks his hand away, and Dr. Maylen lets go with a start.>_
Dr. Maylen: What? Is everything alright?
_< Santiago stares at Dr. Maylen for a moment, glances back to the vessel, then groans.>_
Santiago: Goddamnit.
_< Santiago lifts SCP-8627 from the table and hurls it to the floor, shattering it into a plume of dust. SCP-8627-1 appears within the rising dust, then drops to the floor with a heavy thud. Its skin is blue and cracked, and ashen gray wings protrude from its back. Dr. Maylen gasps, then coughs hard as he exits the sigil.>_
Dr. Maylen: Dear Lord, what have you done?
_< Santiago flips SCP-8627-1 onto its back and kneels over its body, cradling its face in his hands.>_
Santiago: C’mon man, wake up!
_< The faint sound of a door opening can be heard off camera.>_
Santiago: Shit.
_< Santiago takes a shard of broken pottery and begins to scratch at the sigil. The second interlocking door opens, and two guards run in. One guard grabs Dr. Maylen by the arm, the second rushes towards Santiago.>_
Santiago: Get the fuck away from me!
_< Santiago kicks the guard’s feet out from under him and resumes scratching hard at the sigil. Dropping to the floor, the guard grabs Santiago’s ankle and drags him away. Santiago swings back and catches the guard in the throat with the shard, sending a spray of blood against the wall. The guard clasps his throat as he collapses.>_
Santiago: Shit!
_< Santiago drops the shard, hyperventilating as he crawls towards the dying guard, and wraps a hand around his neck, as if to slow the blood loss.>_
Santiago: Oh fuck, man, I didn’t mean—
_< The second guard pulls Dr. Maylen towards the door. He moves slowly, staring at the shattered vessel.>_
Guard: Sir, you need to leave.
Dr. Maylen: How could you…? Why would you do this to me?
_< SCP-8627-1 opens its eyes, glances at the door, and with a flap of its wings, appears beside the guard. SCP-8627-1 slams the guard's head into the door, cracking his skull. The guard crumples to the floor, and Dr. Maylen turns to face SCP-8627-1.>_
Dr. Maylen: I am a child of God. You cannot touch me.
_< SCP-8627-1 grasps Dr. Maylen's face in its hand. Its eyes glow deep red, and the video quality undulates as a thin, otherworldly squeal intensifies to a screech. The video quality returns to normal a few moments later, and the noise dissipates. SCP-8627-1 laughs as Dr. Maylen whimpers.>_
SCP-8627-1: If it brings thee comfort, thy worthless Father abandons all his children in the end.
_< SCP-8627-1 twists Dr. Maylen's head. Bones crack, muscle and skin rip, and Santiago screams as SCP-8627-1 drops Dr. Maylen’s severed head onto the floor. SCP-8627-1 gestures in the direction of the door, and the deadbolt clicks. Wide-eyed, Santiago scrambles back towards the wall as it approaches.>_
Santiago: Oh God, I’m so sorry! Please don’t—
_< SCP-8627-1 offers a bloodied hand to Santiago.>_
Santiago: I, uh—
_< There is a loud thud off camera. Santiago glances at the door, then back up to SCP-8627-1.>_
Santiago: I-I don’t know, man.
SCP-8627-1: Thou may stay and suffer for thy mercy, if thou wish. Or thou may accept my eternal gratitude, and a second chance as thy reward.
_< The thudding off camera grows louder. SCP-8627-1 furrows its brow.>_
SCP-8627-1: Please, Xavi. Come away with me.
_< With a shuddered breath, Santiago leans forward, extending a shaky hand. SCP-8627-1 takes it with a smile, and they both vanish.>_
