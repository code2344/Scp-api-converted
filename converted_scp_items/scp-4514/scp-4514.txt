===MESSAGE FROM ETHICS COMMITTEE RECEIVED===

Dr. Young,

We have reviewed your experiment logs, and deemed them excessive, and unwarranted.

However, if we are to be honest, we noticed your undue testing of SCP-4514 a while ago. It's rare to have D-Class actively line up for experimentation. Testing actual employees was only inevitable.

We needed to discuss what the next step should be: create a standardized process for choosing SCP-4514 test subjects, offer this service to the public, etc.

In the end, as you can tell, we returned to our core principles as an organization. The world has forced us to redefine the status quo, but it is not our job to change it back. No matter how much we want to be at eternal peace, normalcy dictates that we can never achieve it.

Officially, you are hereby removed from the SCP-4514 project.

Unofficially, we get it. 

Life's a bitch.

- Dr. Violet Mesmur, Ethics Committee
