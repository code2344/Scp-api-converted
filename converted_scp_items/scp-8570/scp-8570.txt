SPECIAL CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES

The anomaly is stored as a set of amber borosilicate glass ampules held within a refrigerated, vacuum-sealed containment locker in Site-43's Health and Pathology Department. Knowledge is limited to members of implicated departments and select members of the administration.

1

SCP-8570 should only be handled by personnel equipped with full-body experimental Randall/Yossarian Akiva Nullifier (ERYAN) suits and protective eyewear. Subjects selected for experimentation must first undergo comprehensive physiological and psychological evaluations. Any abnormal internal cavities discovered (such as sinus deformities, congenital voids, surgically induced reservoirs, etc.) are to be filled with a proprietary medical hydrogel in order to neutralize unintentional absorption vectors.

In the rare case testing is permitted, efforts are to take place within a non-porous isolation chamber secured with negatively-pressured atmosphere and regulated via internal HVAC systems. All physical and symbolic containers (e.g. bottles, flasks, religious icons, wearable charms, and more metaphorically-relevant objects, such as notebooks, partially-consumed food, and uncharged electronic devices) must be identified and excluded from the testing environment unless part of the test itself.

 

 

DESCRIPTION

SCP-8570 is a fluidic substance suspended in a state closely resembling 

quark–gluon plasma

 condensate.

2

 It exhibits unstable iridescence and sporadic visual resistance, registering inconsistently across electromagnetic spectra.

Progression of QGP into common hadron gases upon transitioning away from the early conditions of the universe.

✖

SCP-8570 exists with metastability while stored within sealed borosilicate glass ampules treated ritualistically by members of the Applied Occultism Division.

3

 If an ampule is broken, the substance rapidly disperses, and a kenotic event occurs.

Upon release, SCP-8570 seeks out viable vessels inside the smallest enclosed space with relation to the substance itself. If no such enclosure exists, the material disperses and is lost. In the presence of multiple open containers (be them traditional, biological, symbolic, metaphysical, et cetera), it will attempt to divide itself equally among them all, often with catastrophic results to involved subjects; while Humans are easily-affected recipients due to their interpretive fluidity, physical variance, and symbolic capacity for comprehension of SCP-8570's concepts, abstract interpretations of valid criteria for absorption often go overlooked.

Exposure to SCP-8570 results in progressive, linear degradation of the subject’s personality and cognitive growth over time. This process, deemed "theological 

nadirosis

,"

4

 replaces cognition, emotion, and volition with divine receptivity. However, all individuals that have experienced this degradation failed to accept the entirety of SCP-8570 and therefore have not experienced any deific communications.

 

 

ADDENDUM

 — Discovery

SCP-8570 is an Abatement byproduct produced during Targeted Preemptive Worldline Disruption (TPWD),

5

 a banned practice in the wider extradimensional Foundation alliance.

SCP-8570 was first isolated during a containment failure within the now-defunct Worldline Disposal Sector-A2, when high-energy residue manifested spontaneously inside post-disposal observation buffer tanks. This residue eventually condensed into proto-kenotic matter, which, with the help of the Applied Occultism Division, was transferred into a sealed flask and later designated SCP-8570.

As one can see, the emerging pattern defies all theological, symbolic, and scientific expectation; SCP-8570 does not appear to positively respond to perceived purity, completeness, or sanctity. Rather, it seeks that which is fundamentally, irreparably unfinished: an absence incapable of resolution.

Efforts to create "perfect" vessels, physical or spiritual, invariably result in rejection. Conversely, objects with unresolved context, such as symbolic incompleteness, emotional stasis, perceptual ambiguity, physical underdevelopment, et cetera, consistently trigger kenotic events. SCP-8570 selects vessels not based on suitability, but on existential deficit. Receptivity alone is insufficient; it must be involuntary, unresolved. Uninvited. Thus, Divinity, as expressed by SCP-8570, is not awarded to the devout, the pure, or even the prepared. It is conferred to the unfinished. The irrelevant and ignorant.

There is no path to godhood here. Only the weight of our own gravity. SCP-8570 is undoubtedly an agent of kenosis, the stripping away of form to invite total spiritual unification, but the mechanism appears incompatible with human ontology. It is not built for us, and we are not built for it.

— Sr. Rsr. Naomi Deckard, Site-43 Theological and Teleological Division

The prevailing hypothesis suggests that SCP-8570 represents a key aspect of some sacramental process created by an extinct or nonhuman intelligence, the purpose of which may never be discovered. However, speculation of potential use for the substance raised new priorities regarding the study of SCP-8570.

PRESENT:

DR. STANISLAV HESS, ACROAMATIC ABATEMENT SXN., SR. RSR AADHYA PARIKH, RESEARCH AND EXPERIMENTATION, SITE-43

DR. HESS:

 Alright, follow me here.

RSR. PARIKH:

 Shoot.

DR. HESS:

 If the buffer matrix from SCP-8570 carries cognitive and metabolic reversibility at the conceptual level… we may not be looking at waste at all. We might be sitting on pharmaceutically-relevant quanta.

RSR. PARIKH:

 Hm. Would extraction be non-theurgical, then? SCP-8570 is extremely unstable, after all.

DR. HESS:

 

Technically

, it would still need to be under ritual constraints.

RSR. PARIKH:

 What are you thinking?

DR. HESS:

 I suppose it boils down to whether a capsule is a container or not.

RSR. PARIKH:

 …Oh, wow. Okay. Yeah. Let me reach out to Pharmacokinetics.

PRESENT:

DR. FRANCES GRAY, PHARMACOKINETICS NVD

DR. GRAY:

 Status update, 8570-12. This is Dr. Frances Gray of the Department of Pharmacokinetics' Novel Synthesis Division.

DR. GRAY:

 We've received the inscribed gelatin capsules from Applied Occultism. Careful manipulation of the ampule allowed us to break the object while sealed within another container. Since no other containers were inside, SCP-8570 evenly dispersed itself throughout the outer container. Process was repeated with the outer container filled with a specialized multistratum solvent developed by our friends over at R&E.

DR. GRAY:

 Resulting solution was diluted at various strengths for testing purposes. Then, batches were subjected to lyophilization

6

 until crystalline structures began to form.

DR. GRAY:

 From there, limited animal testing was carried out.

DR. GRAY:

 Dilution of SCP-8570-derived fluid at 1:10

9

 yielded 97% remission rate in necrotic tissue. Same-day follow-up revealed reversed Type I congenital abnormalities in all murine subjects. Substance designated Y-

500

. Further dilution projected to be necessary for a clinical trial batch. Say 1:10

13

?

DR. GRAY:

 From here, compounding and encapsulation will be trivial. I have no illusions that this substance will ever see the light of day, but I remain hopeful that it may be used, in limited capacity, to save the lives of the few whose lives are necessary to save. I am extremely grateful for the opportunity.

 

 

ADDENDUM

 — Y-500 Incident Summary

Following a series of encrypted messages intercepted within internal Site-43 relay traffic, a coordinated breach was discovered involving six disillusioned personnel affiliated with the Health and Pathology and Research and Experimentation departments. The group successfully exfiltrated a secure storage container identified as 'Y-500 TRIAL SET BETA (1:1E13)' during routine site transit, replacing it with a mass-equivalent decoy of powdered glucose. Internal trackers were disabled. Approximately three thousand capsules were reported stolen.

PRESENT:

UNKNOWN PARTIES, O5-3 (as Mr. J. Aberfeld), O5-5 (as Dr. T. Langdon)

CHAIRPERSON 1:

 —rumors, gentlemen. Pharma-killers? Miracle cures? This is homeopathic sentiment, wrapped in illicit synthesis, you know the kind. It does not justify its own moral superiority.

O5-3:

 Agreed. Internet hysteria. We have an investigation in motion. Our associates are… already aware of the source of the claims. Unsurprisingly, it fails to live up to the hype.

CHAIRPERSON 2:

 This precludes the possibility of monetization, then? I'm sure less-than-effective products could be sold through some of our more… 

holistic

 subsidiaries.

CHAIRPERSON 1:

 Well, if we are sure of its inefficacy, it is no longer a threat. I don't see why we couldn't—

O5-5:

 The product in question is unstable. It's an unrealistic endeavor.

CHAIRPERSON 2:

 Unrealistic or not, demand’s rising. We can find a stable analogue—

O5-3:

 

Enough.

 There is no conversation to be had here. Things are already underway. This time next week, god willing, you and I will never have to hear nor speak of this non-issue again.

 

 

ADDENDUM

 — Y-500 Status Update

BY ORDER OF COUNCIL MAJORITY VOTE

 

(8–4 in favor, 1 abstain, 1 absent)

PRODUCTION OF Y-500 IS HENCEFORTH TERMINATED.

All research files pertaining to Y-500 are to be sealed with Level 5 clearance. Dissemination constitutes a breach of safety protocol.

Ethics Committee notes on determination:

 

While the therapeutic potential of Y-500 is undeniable, its theological, ontological, and political consequences render it incompatible with any public-facing or private internal initiative. Further manufacture has been labelled a significant threat to the Veil.
