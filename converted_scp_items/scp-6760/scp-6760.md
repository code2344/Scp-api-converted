**Description:** SCP-6760 is a hyper-complex machine intelligence built by the Foundation Department of Tactical Theology. SCP-6760 possesses several experimental components which lend it the following anomalous analytical capabilities:
  * Ultra-high-fidelity probing and mapping of the Infosphere;
  * Widespread pataphysical data-processing;
  * Ontokinetic and semiontological reality manipulation — for the purposes of revealing unknowable and/or inaccessible information.

SCP-6760 was built as a software framework, surrounding the existing Foundation artificial intelligence construct CROM.aic — chosen for its unparalleled analytical processing skillset.
SCP-6760 was created for the purpose of determining "objective truth" via comprehensive mapping of the entirety of human knowledge and further extrapolation.

**Addendum 6760-1, Test Log / Incident 6760-A:** On 05/14/2030, succeeding permission from the O5 Council, SCP-6760 was activated, and its CROM.aic communications terminal was initialized.
Communication with SCP-6760 is accomplished in the form of data queries; operators may present a data point, object, or entity. This information is then processed by SCP-6760 and a simple descriptive response is generated. SCP-6760 also returns information describing the founder, progenitor, or other creator of the selected concept, but due to fundamental design constraints describes these creator entities as "authors"..Shortened to "`au`" in the command line.
Complex queries — those which are not able to be communicated by the declaration of a single object or entity — are disallowed, such that SCP-6760 does not respond with potentially dangerous or overwhelming information, which may cause physical harm or harm to the human psyche. It is to be noted that SCP-6760 would actively avoid answering such queries prior to this.
The following are reproduced transcripts of the subsequent tests and interactions with the intelligence.
