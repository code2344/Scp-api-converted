SCP-8762
**Description:** SCP-8762 is a middle aged man of indeterminate age who identifies himself as "Steve"..SCP-8762 has responded to a variety of names, including, but not limited to; Hubert, Larry, John, Bob, and Juggletron. No records of SCP-8762 exist in any known country, region, or sovereign state. Physically, SCP-8762 is non-anomalous and has the same physiological requirements as typical humans.
SCP-8762 has one noticeable, yet extremely potent anomalous effect: whenever SCP-8762 is within close proximity of any anomalous location or object, their abilities will temporarily cease; the reason behind this is currently unknown. Anomalous personnel will remain conscious, although any abilities will cease until SCP-8762 exits the anomalies proximity. SCP-8762 must be awake, conscious, and in a healthy mental state for this to occur. .Although entering REM sleep doesn't negate this effect, medically induced comas appear to do so.
SCP-8762 was first discovered at Site-01. Camera footage showed SCP-8762 wandering through the hallways for fifteen minutes, appearing extremely confused. After being noticed by several security guards, SCP-8762 was detained and interviewed. Extensive testing revealed that SCP-8762 was not associated with any known group of interest.
SCP-8762 emits no Humes, Akiva radiation, or any forms of anomalous energy, thereby eliminating the possibility of it being a weapon. After it temporarily neutralized SCP-001, it was designated as SCP-8762.
Below is an interview log between SCP-8762 and Foundation researcher Elizabeth Carter.

Following confirmation of SCP-8762's anomalous traits, it was exposed to several minor anomalies to test the limits of its abilities.
> **Test 1**  
>  **Anomaly:** [SCP-6161](/scp-6161), a cake knife that causes all cut objects to become cake.  
>  **Results:** SCP-8762 used SCP-6161 on various items, all resulting in nothing remarkable. He frowned, proclaiming that "You me promised cake, this is a knife."
> **Test 5**  
>  **Anomaly:** [SCP-8022](/scp-8022), a clay brick. Whenever it strikes an individual, they will vividly dream. Individuals hurt by SCP-8022 sustain trauma typical of being hit by a brick.  
>  **Results:** `[TESTING HALTED PER O5 ORDER]`
> **Test 8**  
>  **Anomaly:** [SCP-609](/scp-609), a growing collection of identical green billiard balls capable of being moved telepathically.  
>  **Results:** SCP-8762 is requested to attempt to move SCP-609. Upon attempting for several minutes, .During this time, SCP-8762 held out its hands and loudly grunted, sweating and growing red. it responded, exhausted; "That's enough thinking for now."
> **Test 11**  
>  **Anomaly:** [SCP-113](/scp-113), a small gemstone capable of causing anyone who touches it to swap biological sexes.  
>  **Results:** Results pending. SCP-8762's sex is currently unknown, as all biological scans give mixed results. When asked, it replied with "I'm John."
> **Test 13**  
>  **Anomaly:** [SCP-6914](/scp-6914), a small sign that says "KEEP OFF GRASS". If individuals step on grass located near SCP-6914, they will then be struck by lightning.  
>  **Results:** SCP-8762 proceeded to step on the grass with no issues, although later stated that it felt "a bit inconsiderate."
> **Test 44**  
>  **Anomaly:** SCP-173  
>  **Results:** Initially, SCP-8762 stood within the same room as SCP-173 and did not report any findings. Shortly afterwards, however, personnel report a mild swelling in SCP-8762's face, which it attributed to "a mild peanut allergy"..SCP-8762 had no known allergies, nor has it eaten any peanuts. Moments later, SCP-8762 spontaneously combusted.
Following its untimely death, personnel discovered that its remains still shared the same properties as the anomaly itself. Lead theories suggest that SCP-8762 "absorbed" the properties of other anomalies. Because of this, smaller fragments of it are still capable of weakening anomalous effects. Following research, a new, revised file for SCP-8762 is available below.
