**Item #:** SCP-7544
**Object Class:** Safe
**Special Containment Procedures:**
SCP-7544's entryway should remain locked at all times outside of experimentation. Signage has been installed nearby indicating that SCP-7544 is for janitorial services only. Janitorial services are to be explicitly instructed not to enter SCP-7544.
No other containment procedures are believed to be required at this time.
**Description:**
SCP-7544 is an unlabeled corridor located behind a pair of windowless steel doors within the Administrative Wing of Site-19. It is not present on Site-19's official floor plan, but a few dossiers found within the offices of Analytics & Internal Affairs employees have the anomaly labeled as the "_Department of_ ![blank.png](https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-7544/blank.png) _Meeting Room_."[1](javascript:;)
SCP-7544 does not connect to any rooms save for the initial entryway. It is also devoid of any internal decor, and its walls are painted in stark white (in contrast to the Administrative Wing's grey coloring).
When a subject enters SCP-7544, walks to its far end, and returns, they will be subject to a phenomenon henceforth labeled as SCP-7544-1.
SCP-7544-1 entails the alteration of memories in multiple aspects, the most common of which are listed below:
  * Public spaces (meeting rooms, break rooms, restaurants, etc.) will be remembered as more spacious than they actually were, but lacking in any significant features.
  * Conversations (particularly those with loved ones) will be remembered as brief and without substance.
  * Subjects will recall long stretches of rest and "doing nothing" at times when they were verifiably engaged in productive behavior.

Notably, SCP-7544-1 does not affect memories that the afflicted perceive as significantly impactful on their lives, such as major relationship troubles, graduations, childhood traumas, significant promotions, containment breaches, and other such events.
Occasionally, documentation that appears in [SCP-6208](/scp-6208) will reference SCP-7544. The ramifications of this phenomenon are currently under review.
**Addendum-7544-1: Discovery**
SCP-7544 was discovered when multiple recently-hired Analytics & Internal Affairs personnel reported inconsistencies between their memories and reality, prompting an internal investigation. When interviewed, all subjects reported seeing SCP-7544 in their introductory dossiers, finding SCP-7544 itself, and walking its full length.
Upon further investigation, each of the above personnel were found to have one or more files on their computers which contained or referred to unfinished meeting minutes, all of which appeared to have taken place within SCP-7544. None of the questioned personnel had any memory of the contents of these reports, or of writing them. An example of one of these meeting minutes is included in Addendum-7544-2.
After multiple D-Class tests confirmed SCP-7544's anomalous properties, it was cordoned off, and the current containment procedures were instated.
