**Item #:** SCP-7506
**Object Class:** Safe
**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7506 is kept in a standard containment locker.
**Description:** SCP-7506 is an electric steam iron manufactured in the early 1960’s. The soleplate is heavily dented and covered in various burn marks.
While SCP-7506 is plugged in and switched on, contact between its soleplate and any clothing will cause an audible scream to vocalise from the latter while contact is maintained. The screams will match that of a human, varying in tone and pitch depending on the intended body type the clothing was designed for.
