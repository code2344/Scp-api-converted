**Item #:** SCP-8247
**Object Class:** Euclid
![tiger](https://scp-sandbox-3.wikidot.com/local--files/well-she-s-harmless-to-me/tiger)
An instance of SCP-8247 in an active state.
![cat1](https://scp-sandbox-3.wikidot.com/local--files/well-she-s-harmless-to-me/cat1)
An instance of SCP-8247 in an inactive state.
**Special Containment Procedures:** Instances of SCP-8247 are each to be kept in large, separate animal enclosures at Site-908. SCP-8247 instances are to be provided with appropriate food, water, and enrichment daily. As SCP-8247 instances can transform at will, Foundation Personnel are to approach instances of SCP-8247 with extreme caution. Access to the enclosures outside of providing SCP-8247 instances with their daily needs is not permitted.
Reports of wild animals and/or house pets that show behaviors or abilities that align with documented information about SCP-8247 instances are to be monitored by the SCP-8247 research team in cases of possible containment breaches.
All witnesses of SCP-8247 are to be administered amnestics and released.
Diamond Summers may be allowed to visit SCP-8247-A27 for three hours twice a day during its meal times. Summers is permitted to feed SCP-8247-A by hand.
**Description:** SCP-8247 refers to an anomalous subspecies of felines. SCP-8247 instances possess the ability to transform into a Bengal Tiger at will. SCP-8247 instances have often been observed to display violent tendencies, often attacking and consuming other animals and humans. Despite their primal behaviors, instances demonstrate behaviors of a typical house cat regardless of which form they are currently in. SCP-8247 instances do not require raw meat and are capable of surviving on processed cat food, although larger portions are required and instances still exhibit a preference for fresh meat. Despite anatomy differences, SCP-8247 maintain behavioral traits influenced by the anatomy of big cats, such as the inability to purr except when exhaling. There are currently 247 instances of SCP-8247 in containment.
**Addendum-1-Findings:** The following are relevant media discovered of a notable SCP-8247 instance (dubbed SCP-8247-A27) found by the Foundation in deduced chronological order. This includes social media posts on the platform _Instagram_ and journal logs by its owner, Diamond Summers. This is the only SCP-8247 instance known to be a house pet.

So my therapist (before money became an issue) suggested this journaling thing, so hello journal lol. Anyways, I can’t fucking BELIEVE I’m getting evicted from my apartment. And my only option is to move in with my aunt and uncle
They fucking hate me. They’ve always thought internet influencer wasn’t a ‘real job’. But they offered to let me live with them, probably just so they can boss me around tbh
They've always been so bossy, even when I was a fucking kid. They always yelled at me and called me lazy and shit, and still do. Like they'd even insult my parents for letting me turn out the way I did. Anyway at least I’ve got Meagan, she’s always been so sweet

Ever since we got here, Meagan has been acting very strange. She’s been hissing and scratching my aunt and uncle and once she even bit my aunt. They’re threatening to call animal control if I don’t have her checked out I don’t know what I’m going to do
Poor Meagan doesn’t even seem to notice she’s in danger, she’s just been cuddling up with me at night and licking my face
I don’t deserve her
May 14th
Thank fuck I have a job interview in 2 weeks just about. The closer I am to getting a job, the closer I am to getting out of here. Being an influencer is not paying as well as I thought it would. I’m just not popular enough and sponsors are so hard to come by these days. Maybe they were right. Maybe being an influencer isn’t a real job, I shouldn’t have quit my job

meaganthekittycat Hey guys! I've noticed something kind funny about Meagan. She only purrs when she exhales! Do any of your cats do this? Like she doesn't purr normally. I wonder if it's the breed she is, which I actually don't know lol.

meaganthekittycat Hey guys! I have a few questions I was hoping you could answer. So Meagan has always had a bit of a large appetite LOL. I was wondering- firstly, do any of you have cats with large appetites? And how do you afford all that food? Cause she sure is running me dry! :P

May 22nd
It was a mistake asking Rachel and Todd for help with cat food
they just fucking screamed at me and said "IF YOU CANT AFFORD IT GET RID OF THE DAMN CAT"
I wish Meagan didn't eat so much
I love her but she has the biggest appetite of any cat I've ever seen in my entire fucking life
May 20th
im shaking so badly rn
my whole life has just been turn upside down a lot just happened and why im even still writing in this thing I dont know
they tried to throw Meagan out of the house when I was asleep. I woke up in the middle of the night to get water and I heard meowing by the front door, so I opened it and I FUCKING FOUND HER OUTSIDE I KNOW SHE WOULDNT HAVE GOTTEN OUT ON HER OWN SHE HATES GOING OUTDOORS
So I go and wake the fuckers up and confront them and they just scoffed and said ‘it’s not a big deal’
so I tell them 'YES IT IS THATS MY CAT SHES MY BABY'
and they're like 'its always about the damn cat'
and we argued for awhile about meagan and how I only care about the cat and how they hate me and that im worthless and I need to do something worthwhile and then eventually
Todd jumps out of bed and grabs me by the collar and punches me screaming at me to shut up
and then
theres a fucking tiger in the room
blood
and guts and gore
they're gone
then it just walked up to me afterwards, turned into MEAGAN, and rubbed against me like nothing happened
what am I supposed to do
meagan is a tiger
my aunt and uncle are fucking dead
its a gory mess in here
im fucking terrified
May 20th
I have to get out of here the police are going to come and find me and they'll blame me for this
should I take meagan with me?
what if she just eats me
but I can't just leave her im all shes ever known
but I just
I dont know what to do

**Addendum-2-Police-Reports:** On June 8th, 2021, Diamond Summers and her cat Meagan were reported missing by the local Police Department after the discovery of the bodies of Rachel and Todd Smith. Summers had left behind all personal belongings, including all electronics. Summers was later discovered on June 17th in Saint Joseph, Michigan, approximately two hours away from her hometown of Joliet, Illinois. Summers' was discovered when local reports of a tiger mauling local residents were released. Upon Summers' apprehension, physical notes were found on her person.
June 9th
I had to go
I had to protect Meagan
people would find out
they were going to look for her
and I couldn't have that
I know im homeless now
but I was going to be anyway
its worth it
June 10th
I just realized
how am I gonna feed her
I dont have cat food
shes a fucking tiger
what if she eats someone again
what if she eats me
shes never attacked me before but what if she does it when she goes hungry
shit
June 12th
I haven't given her something to eat in like 3 days we're both starving all she's had is grass
shes started to lick me for no reason im scared
June 13th
I don't think I trust Meagan anymore
shes been acting really weird
shes been randomly turning into her tiger form for no reason
I do not like this
how did I ever trust her
why did I do this
maybe I should go back
and just turn her into the authorities
save my own skin
shes just a cat
June 14th
she did it again
someone tried to talk to us
and she ate them
she can't keep doing this
I begged her to stop and I think she understands
June 14th
Oh my god
he had a knife
I think he was gonna try to mug me
or something
she did it to protect me
not because she was hungry
why do I keep doubting her
I'm such a terrible cat owner
she loves me
and I love her
meagan I love you
**Addendum-3-Interview:** Diamond Summers was taken into by the Foundation on June 20th, 2021. Summers' was later interviewed about SCP-8247-A27. This interview took place before SCP-8247’s file was created.
[ Open Interview](javascript:;)
[\- Close](javascript:;)
> **Interviewed:** Diamond Summers
> **Interviewer:** Researcher Cara Sandals
> **Foreword:** Researcher Cara Sandals of the Zoology department at Site-908 was tasked with interviewing Diamond Summers, the owner of SCP-8247-A27.
> **< Begin Log>**
> **Sandals:** Hello, Diamond. I appreciate you coming to talk with me about Meagan.
> **Summers:** Uh… hello? You said you wanted to like, study her. You’re not going to poke and prod her with needles or anything are you?
> _Researcher Sandals laughs._
> **Sandals:** Oh, no. It’s closer to observing her. But no poking or prodding involved.
> **Summers:** Good. Also, just for your information, the people she hurt were in self-defense! She doesn’t just attack people for no reason she’s not dangerous just because she’s a tiger!
> **Sandals:** Diamond, I understand your defensiveness, but I’m going to ask you to calm down. I didn’t accuse her of being dangerous. You seem to know a lot about her.
> **Summers:** Of course I know a lot about her, she’s my cat! I’ve had her since she was a kitten. And are you sure you don’t think she’s dangerous? I don't believe that you don't!
> **Sandals:** While others like Meagan have shown violent tendencies, Meagan herself has not. I’ve worked with animals a long time. I can tell when one is bonded to a human the way Meagan is bonded to you. I do not think she’s dangerous. I think she’s protective.
> **Summers:** I still don't believe you! I still don't believe you won't take her away from me! Wait- others like her? There are others like Meagan?
> **Sandals:** Yes. We currently have other instances in containment. As I said, you seem quite knowledgeable about the species. What else have you observed about Meagan?
> **Summers:** Observed? Like what? Like what she likes to do? Why do you want to know that? So you can use it against her?
> **Sandals:** Like behaviors, natural instincts, likes, dislikes. Stuff like that. And no, not to use it against her. To help her. Please just answer the question.
> **Summers:** Ugh, fine. Um… she eats.
> _Summers pauses, then laughs._
> **Summers:** _A lot._ Like she’s got this _huge_ appetite! But that makes sense with the tiger thing now.
> **Sandals:** Bengal tigers can eat as much as sixty to seventy-five pounds of food in one night. The instances we currently contain have all been observed to eat a lot of animals and people. But it seems Meagan was able to survive off of cat food.
> _Visible discomfort is seen on Summers’ face._
> **Summers:** Egh, I could never imagine Meagan doing such a thing. She’s a sweetheart, she really is. Yeah, but she eats a lot of it like I said. Um, she also doesn’t purr right. Like she only purrs when she exhales.
> **Sandals:** That’s another natural behavior of a tiger. I’m surprised that didn’t set you off to there something being off sooner.
> **Summers:** Me too, to be honest. Recently I made a post asking my Instagram followers about it, but I never looked at the comments. Still, this all confuses me. What's your goal here?
> **Sandals:** I get that. We’re not all thinking about things like that too hard. Our goal is to help Meagan as I already said. Anything else you've observed?
> **Summers:** Yeah. I’ve found Meagan really likes to play with toys. Have you tried toys with the other instances? Meagan really loves those wands that have the feathers and worms you know?
> **Sandals:** We have not. Currently, we just feed them and give them places to climb and such.
> **Summers:** The fact that you call them 'instances' tells me a lot. Even though they’re tigers, maybe they’d be happier if you played with them! They’re cats too! Maybe you just haven’t found some of their playful sides. Cats often get what seems to be violent when they really just want to play.
> **Sandals:** That’s true. That’s a very common house cat behavior.
> _Sandals sets down her clipboard._
> **Sandals:** Diamond. You’re very knowledgeable about Meagan. Which leads us to believe that you may be of some help to us here. Meagan has also already shown to not like to be distanced from you for too long. It’s been a week and she’s already injured three staff members and attempted to injure two more. Before this interview, I was discussing something with my colleagues, and you've only further proven yourself here. We would like to offer you an opportunity.
> _Summers gasps._
> **Summers:** What kind of opportunity?
> **Sandals:** The kind where we allow you to continue to see Meagan. As we see you’re currently homeless, we will house you and provide you with basic needs. In exchange, you will help us study and take care of Meagan, and possibly other instances of SCP-8247 if it is deemed safe.
> **Summers:** I… I get to keep Meagan? So you were serious about helping her? Now I feel kind of bad for doubting you.
> **Sandals:** You can’t live with her anymore. But you will be allowed to visit her. How often is yet to be determined. What do you say?
> **Summers:** I… of course. I’m not really in the position to turn you down. I’d love to help you. Thank you. Thank you so much.
> **Sandals:** No problem, Diamond. Now, Meagan is probably waiting to see you.
> **< End Log>**
> **Closing Statement:** As of June 25th, 2021, Diamond Summers has been granted Level 0 clearance with some exceptions. Allowing Diamond Summers access to interact with other instances of SCP-8247 is currently pending.
