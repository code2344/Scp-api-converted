Special Containment Procedures:

Dr.Fleischer Holding SCP-8959-1

SCP-8959 is stationary within Observation Post-8959, Site Building 1. Due to its nature, SCP-8959 can not be moved. Unless clearance is granted, entrance into the SCP-8959 Containment Space requires a minimum Security Clearance of level 3.

The Containment Space of SCP-8959 must remain sealed, and entrance into the event horizon of SCP-8959 is forbidden, and unauthorized attempts to enter SCP-8959 will be met with violent force.

Any objects that emerge from SCP-8959 are to be removed by Security Staff with oversight by Site Manager Dr. Bethany Fleischer (updated as of 24/03/2023) and contained within secure chambers until needed for examination.

Description:

SCP-8959 refers to a dimensional breach that emerged within the town of Newville, Hundred Acre. The breach extends 3 by 2.5 meters and can be entered as one would enter an archway.

SCP-8959 began without any notable cause or precedent, appearing within the Newville main street. Immediately following its appearance a brick, hence SCP-8959-1, emerged from SCP-8959. Newville was foreclosed and refurbished into Observation Post-8959. Former residents of Newville were amnestied and distributed throughout local principalities under the 

SCP Amnesiac Distribution Scheme.

SCP-8959-1:

SCP-8959-1 During Initial Discovery

Fundamentally, SCP-8959-1 is a conventional clay brick in its composition, size, and texture. Its unique properties solely encompass its appearance (see image for clarification.) SCP-8959-1 has been described as appearing ‘raw,’ ‘gross’ and ‘wrong’ by observers. Beyond this, SCP-8959-1 shows no abnormal traits and is uninteresting.

SCP-8959-1 will remain within a marked storage unit until needed for further examination or experimentation.

Exploration of SCP-8959:

Dr. Pecker Giving His Presentation

No new objects emerged from SCP-8959 for the following year. Seeking to understand the anomaly, Dr. Elwood Pecker volunteered to enter SCP-8959 and return immediately after 3 minutes. Dr. Fleischer allowed Dr. Pecker to engage with his experiment following a lengthy presentation available for reading under 

SCP-8959 / ‘Know Thy Enemy: Other Dimensions and the Necessity of Examination’.

Dr. Pecker was prepared with an AHS (Anomaly Hazard Suit), modified with a unique multiplane video and audio transmitter nicknamed the Rostrum.

Dr. Pecker prepares to enter SCP-8959

.

Dr. Pecker:

 Dr. Fleischer, you and the gang better be pulling all the bells and whistles for me.

Dr. Fleischer:

 Only the best for you. Although do recall, this is your crusade, not mine. If you get stranded, we won't be back for you any time soon.

Dr. Pecker laughs as begins to march towards SCP-8959.

Dr. Pecker:

 Serves me right, Bettie. Keep the kettle on, will ya?

Dr. Pecker pauses within reach of SCP-8959 and slowly begins to reach into the anomaly.

Dr. Pecker:

 Are my celluloid readings still coming in clear?

Dr. Fleischer:

 You know it, Woodie. Keep doubting me and we’re pulling the plug!

With a deep breath Dr. Pecker dives into SCP-8959. There is an audible scream from Dr. Pecker - all celluloid readings flare up before quickly subsiding. There is no visual feed from Dr. Peckers hazard suit.

Dr. Fleischer:

 Drat and double drat! You there, Mr. Plateau! Get us back a visual feed.

Engineer Plateau starts working his console before Dr.Pecker’s voice comes in through the intercom.

Dr. Pecker:

 If I might describe what I see, Dr. Fleischer? I’m recording everything on my end, and I don’t wanna linger here more than I should.

Dr. Fleischer:

 Fine, fine. Give it to us clear as day.

Dr. Pecker:

 Oh gosh, I don’t know how to describe it.

Dr. Fleischer audibly groans.

Dr. Fleischer

: Try.

Dr. Pecker:

 Well ma’am, I appear to be walking through a corridor of light. There are many openings ahead, potentially thousands. Millions.

Dr. Fleischer:

 Clarify Mr. Pecker.

Dr. Pecker

: It’s giving me the creeps. It’s like there is a vast wall ahead of me, invisible except for all these rectangular openings. When I look up, down, or vice versa it goes on forever.

As I tarry along, this corridor of light branches off into an equally infinite amount forming what I presume is a bridge to every opening. Wait, no. Some are flickering off, whilst others are flickering on. It’s strange, like a city at night.

I’m heading toward an opening as we speak. It could be five meters wide. Starting to feel slightly nauseous too, but that could be nerves.

Dr. Fleischer:

 Noted. Please continue towards the opening. Your celluloids are coming in nominal.

Dr. Pecker:

 Alright and here we go, I am now entering the opening. I can make out shapes in the darkness. Humanoid. One foot in and - Oh GOD!

Dr. Fleischer:

 Pecker? Pecker!? Dr. Pecker can you read me?

Dr. Fleischer gags. There are sounds of screaming and a crowd of people rushing around. Dr. Fleischer eventually vomits; celluloid readings are off the chart!

Dr. Pecker:

 Oh gosh!? They’re disgusting, deformed humanoid lifeforms!

There are sounds of a struggle, trampling feet. Dr. Fleischer gasps, followed by the sounds of something crushing under great weight.

Dr. Fleischer:

 Get out of there! Go just go! Can he even hear me?

Engineer Plateau:

 Yes Doctor, he can hear us.

The sounds of a stampede end. Dr. Pecker takes labored breaths before lifting something heavy. Dr. Pecker is still audibly distraught and yet is unresponsive to any communication. It takes five minutes of dead air before Dr. Fleischer emerges from SCP-8959. He falls unconscious immediately followed by an object hence known as SCP-8959-2

Dr. Fleischer:

 Gosh darn it, get a medical team in here pronto!

Dr. Fleischer stops and grimaces at the sight of SCP-8959-2.

Dr. Fleischer:

 And get more security down here. Get everyone! I think I’m going to be sick.

END LOG

Dr. Pecker remained in psycho-evaluative care for the following two months. He sustained minor dimensional bends and has since continued to work on SCP-8959 in a minor role until such a time he considers fit.

Images taken during his visit inside SCP-8959 are available at the viewer's discretion.

Lifeforms Native to SCP-8959

SCP-8959-2 Shortly After Entering our Universe

SCP-8959-2:

SCP-8959-2 is a deceased humanoid lifeform - killed due to cranial trauma due to a stampede of similar lifeforms after the appearance of Dr. Pecker. Attempts to revive the object were unachievable due to our ignorance of its biology.

Observably, the lifeforms of SCP-8959, hence SCP-8959-3, are equally distressed by the appearances of our nominal universe. SCP-8959-2 is revolting in appearance, similar to SCP-8959-1. After thorough sterilisation, SCP-8959-2 was prepared for deep analysis.

Dissection:

The Heart of SCP-8959-2

SCP-8959-2 is internally reminiscent of conventional humans

, but after the recent development of Dimensional Scanners, every atom of SCP-8959-2 is reflective of a total, three-dimensional universe. It is apparent that the existence of SCP-8959-2 and SCP-8959-1 within our Universe is a geometric paradox. Vitally, the object does not contain any celluloid and instead microscopic cells containing a 3-dimensional equivalent of proteins and h20.

It is unknown how SCP-8959-2, along with SCP-8959-1, continue to exist as 3D objects within a more dimensionally limited space. Current theories suggest that it is a photonic layering created when any object, SCP-8959-1 or Dr. Pecker, enters the in-between the 2-Dimensional and 3-Dimensional spaces. Time is necessary to determine the permanence of this effect.

Following the autopsy, Dr. Fleischer released the following to the SCP-8959 Senior Containment Team.

 SCP-8959-1 Clarifications & Future.

Good morning all, I hope you had a fine and dandy weekend.

I’ve decided to clarify the recent findings with SCP-8959-2. You are all seniors on the SCP-8959 containment and thus will have the responsibility to maintain composure and confidentiality. The possibility of such life was entirely theoretical, and its proven existence requires greater study. However, entrance into SCP-8959 is to be restricted. SCP-8959-1 entered our reality, meaning these admittedly disgusting objects can fall into our Universe. If we probe any further, we may garner the attention of our 3-dimensional neighbours.

We will further study how SCP-8959 came to be and, when the time comes, how to close the anomaly.

In response, Dr. Pecker gave the following:

 RE:SCP-8959-1 Clarifications & Future.

Afternoon,

With respect, we’re beating around the bush here. You all saw the photographs of what is beyond this anomaly. Yes a room, but what sort? Gosh, it's so plain as day is frustrating.

Rows of seats, a large screen from which I emerged? It was a picture theatre! Isn’t that odd?

Now I can’t see where this leads, beyond the observable facts. I stake my career that there is something more, and I encourage we do some kind of reconnaissance into SCP-8959 before we close the anomaly.

I won’t be stepping in again, not after that slaughter I saw - those animals are unpredictable but there is a society over there worth some record. It’s just an itch at the back of my head. I encourage us to do something.

Dr. Pecker

Addendum:

Due to pressure from both the SCP-8959 containment team and growing interest from The Senior Officials, Dr.Fleischer authorized another investigation into SCP-8959. Under the protection of MOBILE TASK FORCES ‘Carve’, Dr.Fleischer headed a team of scientists into SCP-8959.

Three hours passed until four subjects emerged from SCP-8959: Specialist Dr. Toon, Guardsman Mortimer M. of the MTF Carve, and two residents of SCP-8959 (SCP classification pending.)

The following documentation was presented to Dr. Pecker:

 TO THE FOUNDATION

TO THE FOUNDATION & REPRESENTATIVES OF THIS UNIVERSE.

We write to you with a proposition rooted in mutual understanding, scholarly cooperation, and the pursuit of knowledge.

On 9 November 19██, it came to our attention that a version of our institution exists within an alternative continuum—one governed by a reality structure vastly different from our own. It was the appearance of Dr. Pecker from SCP-8959, a cinema screen by our observation, that initially brought the anomaly to our attention. Shortly thereafter, objects from your universe began to enter our world leading to the containment of the sight for further research. We launched SCP-8959-1, a brick, that we launched into your Universe to unify the temporal inconsistencies of our worlds. We have documentation to both clarify and explain this technology, should we deepen communication.

Rather than approach with typical containment protocols or defensive measures, we wish to extend a hand in peaceful discourse. We believe that open communication between our two realities may yield valuable insights into cross-dimensional anomalies, the fundamental nature of existence itself, and more simply the anomaly we have both independently dubbed SCP-8959.

We propose an initial controlled exchange of knowledge, facilitated through neutral communication hubs and secured by the respective containment specialists of both foundations. This exchange would serve as a foundation for future discussions, cultural understanding, and scientific collaboration between our two worlds.

Furthermore, we are prepared to accommodate any stipulations or safeguards your continuum may require. We recognize the vast differences in how our respective realities function—our own bound by rigid laws of physics, while yours may adhere to fluid, surreal principles. It is with great respect for such differences that we move forward with this proposal in good faith.

Should this offer be met with approval, we will arrange a formalized system for discourse that ensures minimal risk to the integrity of either reality. Our foremost priority remains the security, stability, and well-being of all parties involved. Otherwise, we will continue our intention to close SCP-8959 after returning your representatives led by Dr. Fleischer.

We eagerly await your response and hope this marks the beginning of an unprecedented and fruitful partnership.

A Token of Friendship

Sincerely and with great respect,

Director Dalton

Head of Interdimensional Relations

SCP Foundation
