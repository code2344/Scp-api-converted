Around 20 years ago, my dad bought a 

Komputer Świat

1

 magazine, which included a CD. From that CD, he installed a video game called 

Warblade

.

I still remember, when I was around nine, I saw him playing the game for the first time before I joined in.

Over half a year ago, I reminded myself of the game and we came back to it.

Even now, during my third year of college, I played the game during classes.

Who could have thought such a simple game would bring so much joy both to me and my dad?

I love you, Dad!

Item #:

 SCP-8260

Object Class:

 

Euclid

 Neutralized

Special Containment Procedures:

 A webcrawler has been created in order to search for mentions of 

Warblade MK II

 and flag them for review. Every mention of the contents of SCP-8260 or download link to the game needs to be taken down.

Description:

 SCP-8260 is an early test version of the video game, 

Warblade MK II

, made in unity engine by Edgar M. Vigdal. The author shared the version on his 

blog on EMV Software Website

 as a test of the game's performance on various hardware setups.

Before it gained anomalous properties, the game would start with a low-quality main menu displaying a two-headed golden eagle. From there, the player could acces an unplayable level prototype and unusable level editor.

However, since the object gained anomalous properties, the player is shown a message box on the black background after running the executable file. It is worth noting, that the test version does not have internet connection or remote access in any shape or form.

The message box is shown below:

Warning!

Looks like your copy of the game is outdated! Would you like to update?

Yes

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

No, thanks!

After clicking the "No, thanks!" button, the player goes to the test version, which does not have any changes. However, after clicking "Yes", the game gets drastically modified. It is worh noting, that despite drastic changes in the contents of SCP-8260, none of the files get altered.

The game within SCP-8260 is a space shoot 'em up game, which is fundamentally the same, as 

Warblade

.

The main gameplay consists of shooting bug-like aliens on top of the screen from a spaceship on the bottom. There are various items and bonuses dropping from aliens after they get shot.

There are exactly 100 levels in the game. Every twenty five levels, there is a boss battle against a giant spaceship.

There can be seen a significant improvement in the graphics and music of the game. However, most new features announced during the development of 

Warblade MK II

 were not included in SCP-8260.

There are minigames, which are the same, as in the original 

Warblade

. The player enters them by picking up a bonus item. Those minigames are: Meteorstorm,

2

 Memory Station

3

 and Gem drop.

4

Just like in the original 

Warblade

, there is no possibility of saving the progress of the game, thus forcing the player to start a new game each time they turn it on.

Addendum 8260-1:

Edgar Magne Vigdal

Edgar M. Vigdal was a Norwegian game developer and the founder of EMV Software.

5

Vigdal was initially making shareware games for Commodore and Amiga before he moved to Microsoft Windows. His most notable work is 

Warblade

, which gained him enough income to start making games full-time.

In 2007 Edgar M. Vigdal announced the development of a sequel to 

Warblade

, which was called 

Warblade II

 and later renamed to 

Warblade MK II

.

On August 16th, 2012, Vigdal published an early test version of 

Warblade MK II

, which would later become SCP-8260.

However, on April 1st, 2015, Edgar M. Vigdal passed away due to cancer, which was later announced by Simon Quincey

6

 on the EMV Software website. Due to that reason, 

Warblade MK II

 was discontinued.

Shortly after Vigdal's death, EMV Software went out of business. The company website is still up, but doing any purchases from it is impossible. Download links for demo versions on the EMV Software website were hosted on 

www.warblade.as

, which was taken down.

However, demo versions of the games can still be downloaded by entering download links to internet archive websites.

Addendum 8260-2:

Discovery of the anomaly

The anomaly was discovered in August 2025, when Dr. Andrew Fitzgerald ran an early test version of 

Warblade MK II

, which he already had on his computer.

8

 After discovering SCP-8260, he quickly began his research.

He found gameplay footages of SCP-8260 on Youtube, along with a small number of posts on forums and community pages focused on 

Warblade

,

9

 regarding the contents of SCP-8260 with download links to the game. All of those were later taken down. Their uploaders and viewers were given class B amnestics, and copies of SCP-8260 were removed from their computers.

The first important discovery happened, when Dr. Fitsgerald entered the EMV Software website and found out it was updated on April 1st, 2025. The new post from the main page is displayed below:

WARBLADE MK II IS OUT!!!!!

To everyone, who was waiting for the release of Warblade MK II throughout all those years, I have great news for you! Warblade MK II is finally out! Although I had some huge difficulties, I managed to get through it. Maybe I didn't manage to fullfill my full vision, but I am still happy with what I could pull off despite current conditions!

Oh, by the way! To anyone, who downloaded an early test version I posted in 2012, I have even better news! All of you receive a FREE UPDATE!

It was an incredible journey for me and I really hope the game will be worth all the wait you had to go through.

If anyone reads this, I really hope you enjoy. Thank you so much for your patience and playing my games. It really means a lot to me and I've already learned not to take it for granted.

~Edgar

Warblade MK II

 was added to the products page along with the demo. However, the download link for the demo is hosted on 

www.warblade.as

 and an attempt to purchase the game is impossible to complete due to inactivity of EMV Software.

All former associates of EMV Software were contacted and none of them were aware of the update.

An IP address responsible for the website update was tracked down and it turned out to be located in Edgar M. Vigdal's house, which is currently resided by his family. Specifically, the device responsible for the update was Vigdal's computer, which had not been booted since its owner's passing. The Foundation revised the house and examined the computer. However, no files associated with SCP-8260 were found. Residents of the house were given class B amnestics.

The Foundation took down the update of EMV Software Website and reverted it to it's previous state. However, download links for an early test version of 

Warblade MK II

 were removed from Warblade MK II Blog.

Addendum 8260-3:

 Notable differences between 

Warblade

 and SCP-8260:

Main Menu

SCP-8260 has no main menu. Instead, the game starts immediately after executing the file.

EXTRA

In 

Warblade

, the player is able to collect 5 letters, which together form a word 

EXTRA

. After collecting all of them, the player gets an extra life.

However, in SCP-8260, the letters are replaced with 

PNZHF

.

Rank

In 

Warblade

, the player starts with an assigned rank: ENSIGN.

There are six balls dropped from bigger enemies. After collecting all of them, the player's rank gets increased by one degree.

However, in SCP-8260, the player already starts with the highest rank. Now, collecting all of the balls decreases the player's rank by one degree. When all six are collected on a rank ENSIGN, the game crashes.

Lifes

In SCP-8260, the game crashes after losing all lifes.

Cutscenes

SCP-8260 has cutscenes after start of the game and before each boss battle. All of them consist of white text on black screen.

Levels

In 

Warblade

, each level starts with an introduction, shown as below:

GET READY

Level [NUMBER]

[QUOTE]

The formula in SCP-8260 is the same. However, the quotes in the introductions are worth noting.

Addendum 8260-5:

 Below is a list of all cutscenes and level introductions:

Once, there was a king.

The king ruled his own planet. It wasn't the size of Jupiter, nor was it a huge empire. It was even smaller than Pluto. Its size was more comparable to an asteroid.

The population was more of an average town on every other planet the king had been to. Around twenty to forty thousand citizens.

However, the planet could never complain about poor living conditions. Every citizen could live in peace and prosperity. The intergalactic politics was perfect as well, so nobody ever had to fear any potential war.

The citizens loved their king and the king loved his citizens.

The king also had a good life. Not only he was happy as a king, but also a happy father. He lived a peaceful life with his wife and three sons.

It wasn't a lot, but it was his and he was incredibly proud of what he had accomplished. He loved doing what he was doing and he did everything he could to improve the kingdom each and every day.

BONUS LEVEL

Suddenly, the king woke up in the middle of the night, shaking.

He immediately sat up on his bed, clenching his fists on the blanket covering his legs. He was hyperventilating and looking around in panic and confusion while hearing a loud, piercing noise from the outside.

He looked at his wife, who had also woken up. Then, his eyes turned to the window.

He was barely awake, but a few seconds later he sobered up a bit and realized, what was making the noise.

It was the only sound the king wished he would never have to hear in his life.

His heart stopped for a second.

It was an alarm siren.

The king immediately got up and ran up to the window upon realizing, what was happening. He opened the curtains and looked out the window. His heart was pounding and his breath was unsteady, while he was looking around. However, everything looked normal. 

For now…

His wife walked up to him.

– Wh–What's going on?

– I don't know yet… 

But I'm expecting the worst.

He rushed out of the room when he stumbled upon his sons in the corridor.

– Dad, what is that?

– Listen, everything will be okay.

Of course, he was lying. He had no idea, how things will turn. He just wanted to calm his boys down.

He got dressed and ran to his office before the Minister of Defense barged in. He immediately provided all the information he had to the king.

Of course, the planet was under attack. However, there was no military or space pirates. Instead, it was just one little spaceship.

– Just one spaceship? – the king said. – That's it? Just shoot it!

But that was the problem. They not only were trying, but they did not stop. The ship was not only perfectly dodging all the bullets, but also managed to wipe out tens of soldiers and it did not seem to stop any time soon.

The king immediately declared martial law. The citizens were in panic, while the military kept fighting the mysterious spaceship. However, all the defense measures did not give any results.

If the king could, he would go to the front lines himself and fight to his death to defend his home and legacy. However, the kingdom still needed someone to rule the planet. Especially in such difficult times.

At some point, one of the king's sons decided to go and fight. He wanted to defend his home no matter what. Although the father did not like that idea, he respected his son's wish.

The prince hopped onto a giant spaceship and flew towards the only target.

BONUS LEVEL

The funeral happened shortly after the prince's death. It was a big national tragedy perfectly capturing the horror of an ongoing war. Many people showed up, but after the funeral, the king was left alone. The only people who stayed were his wife and his two sons, who always were by his side. Saying, that the royal family was heartbroken would be an understatement.

After a sleepless night, the king locked himself up in his office. He wouldn't let anyone in outside of the ministry of defense. He immediately launched an investigation against the mysterious spaceship. He wanted to know everything.

Who controls the ship?

Who sent them?

What do they want?

But none of those questions were answered. There were negotiation attempts with the spaceship, but nobody from inside ever responded. They just kept going. They killed our soldiers. They slaughtered civilians. Men, women, and children. They kept bombing our land. There was no sign of stopping.

What is especially weird, that's the fact, that nobody occupied destroyed lands. Nobody pillaged homes and other buildings from valuable items. It was just that one spaceship shooting everything on its sight without doing anything else.

After some time, the king's second son barged into his father's office without permission.

– Dad, I want to fight. I want to avenge my brother's death.

BONUS LEVEL

Second death, second funeral.

However, this time there were much fewer people. That wasn't a shock to anyone. Deaths at the hands of a mysterious spaceship increased with each passing day.

The planet was in such a state, that the king got desperate. He did something, that he wished he would never have to do. But he did not have a choice.

The king signed general mobilization. The military started drafting civilians to fight the enemy. They needed as many people, as they possibly could.

But one day, something ironic happened.

Someone knocked at the royal family's door.

It was the commission.

The king's third son was drafted.

BONUS LEVEL

The sky is gray. There's not a single cloud. Instead, it's fully covered in smoke.

No alarm sirens can be heard. No anything. The only sound, that can be heard is a soft breeze blowing through the ruins of something, that used to be streets full of life. It used to be colorful and bright, but now it is in greyish vomit.

The king's hands are shaking as he finishes burying the fourth grave. There is nobody to help him out.

There lies the king's wife. She died in a bombing, alone in her living room, while mourning the death of her third son. With nobody by her side. Her husband, the only one she had left, who should have been there for her, was locked up in his office. He kept monitoring the situation and giving orders to his military.

But now?

There is nothing to monitor.

No orders to give.

No military to control.

No kingdom to rule.

No legacy to maintain.

The king clenches his teeth and his hands are shaking as he keeps staring at four graves. His wife, who he wanted to live a happy life with. His three sons, who he wanted to raise to be great people.

Well, too bad! Now we're here!

What's funny is, that the king knows one thing. The fact that his sons were from the royal family is the only reason their graves weren't marked as "Unknown Soldier".

Only then, the king realizes the true nature of the ship. It didn't want to rob the kingdom. It didn't care about the land. It didn't want to occupy the kingdom or steal anything of value.

It just wanted to destroy. It came here for nothing more, but pure destruction.

The king starts punching the ruined wall of something, that used to be his house. He continued until his mind sobered up and only then he started to feel incredible pain in his hand.

He calmed down.

He looked at a huge stain of blood on the wall. Then, he looked at his hand. Of course, it was bleeding. He didn't care about dressing his wound. He had nothing to care about anymore.

The king gave up.

But not without a fight.

GET READY

Level 100

** BIG TROUBLE **

This boss battle heavily differs from the rest and was considered worth noting.

The battle starts with the player alone on the screen. After a few seconds, the boss flies in from above. Instead of a giant spaceship, the player sees a medium-sized ship resembling a golden eagle with a crown on its head. It is holding a wide shield below it, preventing the player from shooting it.

There is no music in the background and the boss does not have a health bar.

After the player tries to shoot the golden ship and realizes there is no use, the boss pursues its attack.

The golden eagle floods the entire screen with bullets, making them impossible for the player to dodge. That continues and keeps killing the player over and over again.

When the player has only one life left, the boss stops shooting. Instead, the golden eagle throws itself at the player. After the spaceships collide, they both explode and the game crashes.

Thus, continuing the game to further levels is impossible.

Addendum 8260-5:

INCIDENT 8260-1

The incident occured after Foundation was done with all the procedures towards removing SCP-8260 from public eye and the object was contained. The computer with SCP-8260 suddenly booted up and started displaying white text on a black screen. It was in the same formula as the cutscenes in the game.

The text is shown below:

Once, there was a healthy man. He spent his lifetime making video games. It wasn't a lot, but it was his. He loved doing, what he was doing.

Somehow, he managed to make some big-selling shareware games. He enjoyed reading all the positive reviews. He appreciated support from his family and friends.

After he made 

Warblade

, he knew he was ready. He had big dreams. He had huge ambitions.

He wanted to create his biggest work. His magnum opus. Something, that would make everyone know his name.

Something, that had the potential to create a huge community. He wanted to bring joy to as many people as possible.

So, he started working. He worked hard. After starting a crowdfunding campaign, he earned far more, than what he asked for. He never expected this many people would be there to support him. To make sure his dream comes true. To bring to life all of the ideas, that stayed in his head for so many years.

He started programming. He hired a graphic designer and a musician to make sure the game's quality was as high as possible.

He couldn't wait to see all the awaiting players to finally be able to enjoy his game. Something he worked hard on all those years.

But then? Something came in.

Now, everything he was. Everything he could have been.

It's all gone now.

And all that took was one diagnosis.

Yesterday, he thought he was immortal.

But now, the doctor brings his family in.

He doesn't have much time left.

However, he did not give up. He knew he couldn't wait, because if he did, all of it would crumble. He started working even harder. He wanted to do as much as possible in as little time he had. He was racing with the grim reaper himself. The man was so close to finishing his work, but the death was faster.

First, the man lost his father.

Then, he lost his own life.

Now all of his ideas are taken to his grave. The crowdfunding was for nothing. Eight years of hard work was for nothing.

His work became the second Silmarillion, but there was no one to finish it.

Even if someone tried, it would not be the same. They will never have the same hand as the man, who worked on it. They will never know, what he wanted to make. All the ideas he had are now deleted by the death of his brain.

He could at least make a few bucks for his family after his death if only his own company did not go out of business. Now not only they can not rely on him anymore, but also no one can access any of his works. There are pirate downloads, but how little there are.

His biggest work is left unfinished, while all his already finished works are forever doomed to obscurity.

Now, very few people barely even remember his name.

The man couldn't stand that.

He could not let the world fuck him over.

He wanted to kill God with his bare hands.

He could not let it go. He did not want to die the second time yet.

He did not want to be forgotten.

So he dug himself up from the grave and finished, what he started.

However, the very moment he did that, no one was there to play it. There were very few people who did. It already brought a smile to his face knowing he brought some joy to at least one person.

But then 

they

 came in.

They deleted every update from the webstie. They removed all the copies of the game. Now everyone, who played it, doesn't even remember playing it. They made sure the man would not be able to put his work out there. They shut him down for good.

The man tried to finally give out his last breath, but was immediately choked before he could even do that.

The worst in all of that is, that he could never go out on his own terms.

After that, the computer blew up, thus destroying the only documented copy of SCP-8260.

The anomaly was marked as Neutralized.
