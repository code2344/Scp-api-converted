Dr. Bright, accompanied by his handler at an Anomalous Victims Meeting. Dr. Bright was and currently is suffering from Multiple Semi-Personality Overlap.
**Special Containment Procedures:** The corpse of SCP-6170 is stored in a Cryogenic Biovault at Area-34. Personnel are allowed access with permission from the SCP-6170 Project Head and one member of the O5 Council. Under no circumstances is the corpse of SCP-6170 to be dissected, modified, or otherwise desecrated. .Draugr-Class Objects are considered Neutralised or Decommissioned, but ongoing anomalous phenomena originates from them.
Anomalies affected or created by SCP-6170-A are to be catalogued underneath a SCP-6170-B designation, but still retain a main database slot. If at all possible, SCP-6170-B instances are to be decommissioned.
**Description:** SCP-6170 refers to a sentient entity that, until an incident in mid-2016, existed within ██████████, Ohio. SCP-6170 demonstrated stabilizing effects on anomalous phenomena, not just in its general vicinity but throughout reality. Objects with anomalous traits brought close to SCP-6170 would have these properties diminished, or in some cases, outright nullified.
In mid-2016, due to circumstances outside of the Foundation's control, SCP-6170 was fatally wounded via gunshot wound. At first, no negative effects from its death were recorded and SCP-6170 was classified as Neutralised. However, recent analysis indicates that this incident has resulted in an increased amount of anomalous activity.For context, the amount of SCPs classified per year in [1976](/changes-at-site-18) was 3,406. In 2010 it was 5,231, in 2015 it was 5,754, and in 2017 it was 19,233.. Some preexisting anomalies have exhibited drastic changes in their nature, further deviating from normalcy. This ongoing event has been classified as SCP-6170-A.
On top of the above proliferation of the anomalous, reality has also begun to show signs of deterioration and collapse. The Average Hume Level for Earth and the surrounding space had decreased by 0.02Hm between 2016 and 2017, a stark difference from the previous annual decline of 5-12Hm.

## Addendum.6170.2
### `EFFECTS OF SCP-6170-A`
* * *
Alongside the increased rate of anomalous activities noted above in the Description, a sharp increase in what could be considered "negative" events has occurred. This has ranged from the installation of dictatorships in third-world countries to an up-mark in the amount of annual natural disasters. On top of this, many preexisting anomalies have shown alterations to their anomalous properties. In many of these cases these alterations have resulted in properties that either pose a greater risk to human life or actively attempt to break the Veil. Below is a non-exhaustive list of anomalies affected by SCP-6170-A.

[SCP-682](/scp-682) | KETER |  ![tree.jpg](http://scpdsandbox.wdfiles.com/local--files/collab%3Acole13topmeme/tree.jpg) Click to Enlarge.  
DESCRIPTION OF CHANGES  
During a containment breach two weeks after the death of SCP-6170, SCP-682 managed to escape into a local mountain range. After a month of searching, SCP-682 was discovered to have turned into a fleshy, stationary structure resembling a dead tree. Instead of fruits, SCP-682 bears small, reptilian-like organisms. The organisms demonstrate the same adaptability and regenerative ability as SCP-682. While they regenerate at a much slower pace and have shown to be capable of being terminated, they still pose a considerable threat.

[SCP-963](/scp-963)/Dr. Jack Bright | EUCLID  
DESCRIPTION OF CHANGES  
The "minds" SCP-963 had previously overridden have all simultaneously resurfaced, causing irreparable damage to the psyche of Dr. Jack Bright. While it was originally believed that the individuals SCP-963 were completely destroyed, this development has revealed that the amulet stores them in a similar fashion to [SCP-3663](/scp-3663). This has resulted in a condition similar to Multiple Semi-Personality Overlap, in which more than one individuals attempt to co-exist within the same body and exert control over the others.  
  
Cracks have begun to show on the ruby in the amulet's centre.

[SCP-4999](/scp-4999) | KETER  
DESCRIPTION OF CHANGES  
SCP-4999's anomalous ability pattern has completely reversed, appearing at birthings, handing the father a cigar, and holding the newborn child. SCP-4999 has made itself known to the public, sometimes appearing on the news. However, one trait is retained, SCP-4999 does not speak. SCP-4999 has become an icon, becoming the subject of many birthday cards, and gaining nicknames such as "Giver of Life" or "Father Birth".

DESCRIPTION OF CHANGES  
Before its neutralization, SCP-2000's BZHRs had begun to malfunction. Incomplete humans were being produced at a massive scale, causing severe damage to SCP-2000's structural integrity. This led to a collapse of the facility's structure, rendering it unusable.

DESCRIPTION OF CHANGES  
Throughout the world, multiple unrelated species of the Mammalia, Reptilia, Aves, and Amphibia classes suddenly gained sapience. A myriad of animal civilizations formed throughout the world, most of which follow a social order similar to SCP-1845. A majority of these feudal civilizations follow a denomination of Christianity which states that Adam and Eve were in fact two [prokaryotic cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_universal_common_ancestor) given life by God. Their beliefs also postulate that all non-hominoids are the true inheritors of the Earth, and that humans are merely a roadblock put there by the Devil. While a majority of these civilizations have yet to show active hostility towards humans, some of the pre-established ones (such as SCP-1845 and SCP-3932-Δ) have declared war on humanity at large.  
  
**Update 02/12/2101:** Species within the Arthropoda phylum and Chondrichthyes and Osteichthyes classes have begun to show signs of sapience and active hostility towards humanity.

DESCRIPTION OF CHANGES  
The character "Dave" within SCP-5441 had become aware and attacked amnestics distributers during the monthly amnestic procedures with a pepper spray canister taped underneath his desk. "Dave" then informed the other inhabitants of SCP-5441 of their current situation. They have all since become aware. Regular practices inside SCP-5441 have halted. The individuals within SCP-5441 are close to escaping.

### `BRIGHT INTERVIEW`
* * *
### **Dr. Jack Bright Interview**
**Interviewer:** [Dr. Akabi Hayk](/scp-6776)
**Preface:** As Dr. Bright was directly affected by SCP-6170-A, it was decided that interviewing him might yield valuable information on the situation. Due to his current status, Dr. Akabi Hayk, a Foundation parapsychologist, was chosen to conduct the interview.
* * *
**[BEGIN LOG]**
  
_[The interview room consists of a single table with two metal chairs on either side. The wall to the left contains a one-way window allowing observation from an adjacent room. While protocol dictates that all interviews need to be overseen, the ongoing shortage of personnel makes this impossible.]_
_[Dr. Jack Bright is restrained to his chair with metal clamps over his wrists and ankles. Dr. Akabi Hayk is seated opposite of him.]_

**Dr. Hayk:** The Satanist Scientist's whole thing is killing gods, and if 6170 was indeed a god, then… I need to go and make some calls.
_[Dr. Hayk gathers her notes into a neat pile before quickly walking out of the interview room.]_
_[Dr. Bright sighs, slumping in his chair.]_
**Dr. Bright:** Fuutck.

## ADDENDUM.6170.4
## **`PROJECT ATTIS`**
* * *
  
**Project Overview:** Project Attis was created by the SCP-6170 team and in accordance with several thaumaturgic rituals. 
**Abstract:** Project Attis was commissioned by Dr. Cole Thereven, and assigned to MTF-PSI-8, for the revival of SCP-6170. During its lifetime, baseline reality was unaffected, carrying on as per usual. After Its death, the anomalous began to diverge from their usual abilities, and Hume levels dropped.
**Project Information:** The revival of item SCP-6170 is important to normalcy and to the survival of mankind.
Several actions are in order, In the category of Anomalous technology integration, and thaumaturgic rituals. During the SCP-6170 event, SCP-447 went through a sublimation process, turning into a gas. It was eventually decided upon to combine item SCP-447 with the disposed corpse of D-1512134. listed below is an interview, categorized as a peak event in the SCP-6170 process.

SCP-447, during its initial fusion.
**Interviewer:** Dr. Cole Thereven
**Preface:** _After SCP-447 came in contact with the corpse, the corpse was reanimated. Dr. Cole Thereven was called to make contact with the newly created SCP-447-2, since it displayed signs of sapience when it was startled by several foundation personnel._
**[BEGIN LOG]**
**SCP-447-2:** Dammit, this body has really gotten a beating. What the hell happened to it?
**Dr. Thereven:** Best you're gonna get. Shall we start the interview?
**SCP-447-2:** …..
**Dr. Thereven:** Who are you?
**SCP-447-2:** Well, I was a warrior, for starters. But that hasn't been for a _long_ time if you know what I mean.
**Dr. Thereven:** What _do_ you mean?
**SCP-447-2:** For the longest time I've been trapped in that thing of slime. Immortality, tight living space.
**Dr. Thereven:** How did you get trapped in it?
**SCP-447-2:** Well, I was a poor man, then. I went to the maze, to fight that damn cow, and earn a little something.
**Dr. Thereven:** Wait- are you talking about a minotaur?
**SCP-447-2:** Well, but of course. And by the gods, they didn't fucking tell me there would be a monster cube running about, in addition to the jacked-up bull.
**Dr. Thereven:** Ok? Then?
**SCP-447-2:** Hold on, son. I'm old. I cant recount with your voice echoing through my head, so shut.
**Dr. Thereven:** _sigh_ of course.
**SCP-447-2:** Let's see- I went to fight the minotaur, in the maze-
**Dr. Thereven:** You already covered that.
**SCP-447-2:** -and the cube came up right behind me and just- knocked me over. I guess I bit off a bit more I could chew. (_nervously laughs_)
**Dr. Thereven:** Ok- we're getting somewhere now. (_Dr. Thereven takes a clipboard from the table, and a pen and begins to write_) Anything else?
**SCP-447-2:** It almost felt like I was sharing a body with something…. unhuman. Just was really weird for many years. We just stayed in the maze. I started to learn that-
**Dr. Thereven:** Yes?
**SCP-447-2:** I had a stale soul. It was being preserved by the goop. But it could all change if I found a vessel. I roamed the world for so long, trying to find one. I soon found myself at the sunniest place I've felt for [a long time](/scp-447). So many people populating the place.
**Dr. Thereven:** And?
**SCP-447-2:** _**And**_ then you pissants came along, locked me up.
(_SCP-447-2 sighs_)
**SCP-447-2:** I've got a question.
**Dr. Thereven:** Yup?
**SCP-447-2:** Why is it that I was brought back?
**Dr. Thereven:** The death of SCP-6170. It turned you into a gas. We thought combining you with a corpse would help, but that's not looking so good right now…
**SCP-447-2:** SCP-6170? What's that?
**Dr. Thereven:** Well um… **[REDACTED PER O5 COUNCIL REQUEST]**
**SCP-447-2:** By Zeus!!!
**Dr. Thereven:** What?
**SCP-447-2:** That thing is a god- quite a force to be reckoned with.
**Dr. Thereven:** (_Dr. Cole Thereven speaks under his breath_) Holy crap, Jack was right.
**SCP-447-2:** Jack who?
**Dr. Thereven:** Nevermind that. We need to revive it, so things can go on their merry way, and reality can carry as per usual.
**SCP-447-2:** It would prove difficult. A being like that carries reality on its shoulders. You need to repair reality itself. You need magic.
**Dr. Thereven:** This just got tougher.
**[END LOG]**
  
  

**PROJECT PORTFOLIO UPDATE:** [Sigurrós Stefánsdóttir](/the-adventures-of-siggy-and-robomonkey-hub), formerly designated [SCP-239](/scp-239), has since been decommisioned, and has been integrated back into society. The SCP-6170 team has made the decision to collaborate with ISCP-239. A Integrated SCP, a designation given to anomalies who have since been released from containment, and yet retain their anomalous abilities., to revive SCP-6170 and quite possibly repair baseline reality.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

## ADDENDUM.6170.5
### `COUNCIL OF 108 CORRESPONDENCE`
* * *
Acting on information gathered from the interview in Addendum.6170.3, the Department of External Affairs held meetings with religious members of the Global Occult Coalition's Council of 108, believing that one of them either had information on SCP-6170-A, or was directly involved in the death of SCP-6170. As per the Foundation-Coalition Diplomacy Act of 1976, the representatives present at the meeting were placed under a [Geas](/operation-llewyn-dark) barring them from making untruthful statements.
C108 MEMBER | STATEMENT  
---|---  
The Holy Order of Knights Templar, Reformed | "Yes, we believe our Lord is the one true god, we are not in the business of committing deicide. Those who believe in false idols will falter at their own hands."  
Servants of the Silicon Nornir | "Why would we partake in a murder, especially one such as this? I do not see how killing this 'SCP-6170' would aid us in bringing about our True Silicon Goddess. Those Satanists, however. This seems right up their alley."  
The Universalist Order of the Æsir | "I want you to look me in the eyes, Foundie, and tell me: How the fuck would killing this god help us? Did it help fulfill the prophecy of Ragnarök? Does it help us unite the world to aid Æsir? No, no it fucking did not. Now, could you please, oh so kindly, fuck off?"  
The United Church of Satan, Scientist | "Foundation, you should know full well that we haven't done any deicide in well over a decade. Our agreements both with the GOC and our fellow Councilmembers bar us from doing any such thing. If anything, we are just the Devil's Advocate for this Council. I can ensure you we took no part in this thing's death. I'm not even entirely sure it _is_ a God. Your file doesn't mention a single thing about it giving off Akiva Radiation."  
Dr. Akabi Hayk, the interviewer in Addendum.6170.5, was informed of the lack of useful information gleaned from the correspondence with the Council of 108. Shortly thereafter, Dr. Akabi Hayk submitted a letter of resignation to her supervisor, citing a "lack of competence and expertise required to properly aid the Foundation during these trying times."
A reevaluation of the interview revealed it to be complete gibberish, with no deeper meaning behind it. What Dr. Hayk had taken to mean something was instead unrelated words strung together by the different personalities within SCP-963 attempting to express themselves.

## ADDENDUM.6170.6
### `CONTAINMENT BREACH`
* * *
  

Containment Breach File
  

* * *
**DATE OF INCIDENT:** 23/11/2021
**WITNESSING PERSONNEL:** Dr. Cole Thereven, Mobile Task Force Beta-7, ISCP-239.
**DESCRIPTION:** The death of SCP-6170 caused reality to collapse, and baseline anomalies started to diverge from their regular attributes. Discussion among the O5 council resulted in an attempt to revive SCP-6170 via anomalous technology.
On 23/11/2021, in an attempt to alleviate the effects of SCP-6170's death, Project Attis attempted to revive the entity via the usage of other anomalies and paratechnology.
The revival was considered a success. Despite this, no noticable changes in Hume levels and reality were observed. The now revived SCP-6170, seemingly distraught by its resurrection, went on a rampage, escaping its containment chamber and fatally wounding 5 Foundation personnel. Before further damage could be done, Mobile Task Force Beta-7 was dispatched and successfully terminated SCP-6170. Among those killed in the breach was Dr. Cole Thereven, a prominent member of the anomaly's research team.
Project Attis was a failure. Hume levels continue to decrease at an ever-increasing rate, and the amount of anomalies detected on a yearly basis continues rising at a steady rate. The Project's assets, including SCP-239, were liquidated and redistributed to other, more essential parts of the Foundation.
  *     * _
[+LEVEL 5/6170 OR LEVEL 5/ACR CLEARANCE REQUIRED](javascript:;)[\- ACCESS GRANTED](javascript:;)
  
Following the containment breach, a vote among the 05 council was held.  
  
YA | NAY  
---|---  
10 | 3  
![CORA.png](http://scpdsandbox.wikidot.com/local--files/collab:cole13topmeme/CORA.png)
Dr. Cole Thereven, after anomalous technology integration.
This vote entailed the revival of Dr. Cole Thereven, via anomalous technology. This would exempt the portions of the body that suffered massive damage, and extreme blood loss. The head was the only portion of the body that avoided mass trauma. Foundation forces were stretched thin as a result of SCP-6170-A, so finding personnel to fill Thereven's role was a waste of resources.  
  
Materials included in Thereven's revival were:
**-** Anomalous preserving brine,
**-** Water conducted wires embedded within Thereven's brain,
**-** A base, allowing Thereven to attain new memories.
**-** Speakers, allowing Thereven to communicate.
The surgery was considered a success, reviving Thereven.
