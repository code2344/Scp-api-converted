Item #: SCP-5375

Euclid

SCP-5375. The empty cell is the slot for the DeVry Core.

SPECIAL CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES:

 Anderson Systems executives are fully cooperating in an effort to locate and secure SCP-5375. Due to the involvement of SCP-5353, the investigation is being headed by MTF θ-15 ("Nametaggers"). The PANOPTICON system is operating at peak efficiency and should be capable of triangulating the location of PoI-0000 (Nobody) should they come in range of a node or Aerial Surveillance Drone.

DESCRIPTION:

 SCP-5375 is a proprietary piece of paratechnology developed by Anderson Systems, LLC, identified by the codename "the Name Machine". SCP-5375 was designed & constructed under an exclusive contract between the Foundation and Anderson Systems, and kept strictly confidential by both parties. Information tracing is ongoing to discover any unauthorized individuals who could feasibly have discovered SCP-5375's existence.

SCP-5375's stated purpose is to more effectively combat and contain identity-based cognitohazards and paramemes. It accomplishes this through a mixture of paratechnology and traditional engineering, the specifics of which are available with proper clearance at the 

SCP-5375 Full Schematic Dossier

. SCP-5375 is capable of extracting identity-based concepts and topologies from individuals or objects, applying them to other individuals or objects, or fabricating such concepts and identities to apply to semantically null individuals or objects, given a 'source' to pull concepts from. At the time of loss, SCP-5375 had only been tested in controlled laboratory conditions.

SCP-5375 was stolen from its secure location in Lab 34E of the Anderson Complex, New Portland, on 09.27.2077, by an unidentified party of two individuals. The prototype was largely complete at this point, only lacking a critical power component removed for maintenance (the DeVry Core), paid for in full, and set to be transported into Foundation custody on 10.02.2077. The individuals evaded the significant security systems installed in the building and lab, disconnected the 5-ton prototype, and transported it out of the building without attracting attention, implying some level of anomalous capability. In addition, they possess a deleterious effect on surveillance data depicting them. Camera footage will depict them as a shifting black blur, and biometric sensors fail to record any data when they enter or exit a facility. Whether this is anomalous ability or technologically-based is currently unclear.

However, by piggybacking onto these tracking systems, global surveillance and identification system PANOPTICON was able to track the physical presence of one individual by identifying the absence of data wherever they appeared, effectively creating an informational silhouette. The ability of individual to evade the PANOPTICON is a pressing threat to Foundation security interests; Engagement Rule B-19 "Good Hunting" is in effect for the remaining individual.

Foundation Fast-Response Fireteams aerially deployed to the discovered individual's location in a disused warehouse on Bumaro Plaza and forcibly took them into custody for questioning. At this point, it became clear that this individual was

INTERROGATION LOG - SCP-5353

FOREWORD:

 Prior to the arrest, SCP-5353's location had been triangulated via PANOPTICON nodes and MTF π-1 ("City Slickers") established a secure perimeter, diverting public aircar traffic with the explanation of a potentially dangerous anomaly on the premises. FRFT7 deployed aerially through the roof of the factory, engaging in a small firefight with SCP-5353 before disabling him with nonlethal charges. Further investigation revealed a small cot and living space set up in a former office, indicating that he had been present there for some time. SCP-5375 was not found on the premises.

An injured member of FRFT7 was medevaced to Our Lady Saint Hedwig Memorial Hospital for medical care. SCP-5353 was taken into holding at Mass Containment Site Beta for questioning by MTF θ-15 ("Nametaggers") Captain Aleksander Maliz.

«BEGIN LOG»

SCP-5353:

 Well, 

good

 evening.

MALIZ:

 Hello. You're SCP-5353, correct? The Man in the White Suit?

SCP-5353:

 Huh. Yeah, that's me. I can't say I expected anyone to remember.

MALIZ:

 My name is Captain Maliz-

SCP-5353:

 

Ah.

 That explains that. Tyler's son, taking up the old family mantle?

MALIZ:

 Tyler Maliz was my uncle.

SCP-5353:

 Making Hester your… I see. Funny how fate seems to fit us together.

MALIZ:

 Sure. I was saying, I'd like to talk to you about SCP-5375. The Name Machine.

SCP-5353:

 What makes you think I know anything about that?

MALIZ:

 Because I haven't even explained what it is yet.

SCP-5353:

 Ah, bollocks.

MALIZ:

 And we have surveillance records of you from before the Drop, 2019. The day you met my uncle, actually. Even then, you had the exact same effect on the old CCTV cameras as Nobody. You were in the Anderson building with Nobody. You took the Machine, or you know where Nobody has it. And you're going to tell me.

SCP-5353:

 And why would I do that, son?

MALIZ:

 Why wouldn't you?

[Pause.]

SCP-5353:

 Hell does that mean?

MALIZ:

 I know the history. You've been hunting Nobody since World War I - 

a hundred and fifty years.

 What changed, I wonder - why are you now willing to cover for it?

SCP-5353:

 I haven't exactly been hunting Nobody though, have I?

MALIZ:

 Yeah? Then what were you doing when you met my grandmother and my uncle?

SCP-5353:

 I was hunting what it leaves behind. Husks, shells of people. The empty wrappers it leaves behind when it's done feasting.

MALIZ:

 Why?

SCP-5353:

 What do you think I am? What do you think the connection between us is?

MALIZ:

 You're Nobody's foil. You exist only in opposition to him.

SCP-5353:

 Not entirely wrong, but not what I was looking for. I'm a walking reminder of Nobody's body count.

MALIZ:

 I don't understand.

SCP-5353:

 I contain multitudes, mate. I'm every single body it left behind, wrapped neat into a package with a bow on top. No one mourns the forgotten, it's why they're forgotten. So I give them a second chance; an opportunity to end Nobody's cycle.

MALIZ:

 So… are you a person, or some sort of hive-mind?

SCP-5353:

 Neither. Certainly not a hive mind… but I can't exactly be a person either. I'm not sure I ever really existed at all. I just became.

MALIZ:

 Then what changed? If I was you, I'd be out there aiming for Nobody's skull.

SCP-5353:

 The…. situation has changed. A new element is in play, and it could very well change the game.

MALIZ:

 The Machine.

SCP-5353:

 Aren't you a sharp one? Just like your grandmother.

MALIZ:

 What do you plan to use it for?

SCP-5353:

 Sorry, not sharp enough. We're not there yet, and I'd be remiss to spoil the show.

MALIZ:

 You don't have to. The machine builds identities, you two are without them… it won't work, you know.

SCP-5353:

 What?

MALIZ:

 You're pushing the machine to do something it wasn't meant to do - it fabricated a few identities under trial conditions, and it can't make more than one at a time without some sort of base source. It'll have to consume something, someone, for more.

SCP-5353:

 Two's not that much more than one.

MALIZ:

 Not that you'll ever get the opportunity as it stands. But, tell us where Nobody has the machine… maybe we can work something out.

[Pause.]

SCP-5353:

 I'll take my chances.

[Pause.]

SCP-5353:

 This is the part where you get mad, call me a cryptic asshole and then leave.

MALIZ:

 You are a cryptic asshole, but this is more than you've ever talked to us. I know where I stand in these matters. Do you?

[Pause.]

SCP-5353:

 You think I could get a carton of cigs?

MALIZ:

 Cigarettes? Christ, no. It's not the 2020s anymore.

SCP-5353:

 Fuck off.

«END LOG»

AFTERWORD:

 Captain Maliz reported that SCP-5353 appeared visibly disturbed by his questioning through the interview. Another interrogation was scheduled for the following day, while PANOPTICON nodes and FRFTs were placed on high alert for possible Nobody movement on the streets or skytops. The New Portland Peacekeeper Wing was also forwarded information on Nobody to maximize nodes of detection.

CAMERA LOGS - ANDERSON L.C.F

FOREWORD:

 On 9.31.2077 at 3:26 AM (local time), security at Anderson Systems' Las Cruces Facility, a New Mexico campus host to a number of skunkworks projects, reported a break-in in the area of Simurgh Labs, the research group responsible for the development and construction of SCP-5375. Only one item was reported missing - a component of SCP-5375, the DeVry Core, that was awaiting shipment to the greater Anderson Complex in New Portland. Camera logs surrendered:

«BEGIN LOG»

CCTV CAMERA 13: HALLWAY

[Camera sweeps to elevator. Elevator doors open, and a humanoid black blur exits the elevator. The stripped and unconscious body of a janitor is visible in the elevator until the doors close. No identifying qualities are discernable from the blur's silhouette. Camera sweeps to lab door. Figure approaches door holding a keycard, swiping it. Door opens, figure enters.]

REGISTRAR SENSOR 14: LAB

3:01AM

Access granted (Janitor Worhol)

CCTV CAMERA 14: LAB INTERIOR

[Camera sweeps to door. The individual enters and wanders around the lab at a brisk pace for several minutes. A number of projects are lying on the worktables, but they do not acknowledge any. The individual arrives at the melon-sized DeVry Core, which sits alone near the edge of the lab. They heft the core and quickly move to exit the lab.]

«END LOG»

AFTERWORD:

 Paratechnology consultants at both Anderson Systems and rival firm Tou-Hei Heavy Industries have confirmed that the DeVry Core is only useful in its current state as a component of SCP-5375. Surveillance for possible Nobody activities has been increased.

SCP-5353:

 So, I think I've gone and figured it out.

MALIZ:

 Pardon?

SCP-5353:

 You asked last time why, right?

MALIZ:

 Why you were putting your trust in your sworn enemy, yes.

SCP-5353:

 Right… and I think I get it now.

MALIZ:

 Do tell.

NETWORK CAMERA 159: VENT INTERIOR

[A black blur crawls through the metal vent pipe. Gas in the vent makes it difficult to see but the figure continues their scooting down the pipe.]

SCP-5353:

 Nobody eats your identity, it's what it always does. It's in the nature of the thing. But, I figure that it's not instantaneous.

MALIZ:

 You figure? Shouldn't you know better than anyone? You're his victims.

[Pause.]

SCP-5353:

 No. That's not true. I'm not his victims, I'm only made of them. It only leaves shreds of identity left… but add enough shreds together and you get something resembling a painting, no? I

MALIZ:

 So you're saying you're something else entirely?

SCP-5353:

 I'm saying I'm greater than the sum of my parts. But as I was saying…

MALIZ:

 Sure.

SCP-5353:

 The consumption isn't instantaneous. It takes a while for it to shear through what makes you 

you.

 And I'm getting the sense that… you were right.

MALIZ:

 About what?

SCP-5353:

 Something's different this time around. He's different.

MALIZ:

 This new Nobody?

SCP-5353:

 It's the same damn Nobody every time. But the host matters just as much.

NETWORK CAMERA 324: VENT EXTERIOR

[The vent cover flies off the vent and drops to the floor with a clang. Two boots pop out as the figure extricates themself from the air-conditioning vent and drops to the floor. No one else is visible in the hallways. The figure starts briskly jogging down one of the paths.]

MALIZ:

 Okay - the host, then. What's different?

SCP-5353:

 I don't know. Maybe his will is stronger or maybe it's just not been long enough, but he still has some vestiges of humanity left. For better or for worse.

MALIZ:

 That's enough to make you trust him? Really?

[Pause.]

SCP-5353:

 No. I wasn't entirely truthful earlier.

MALIZ:

 No kidding. About what?

SCP-5353:

 I have been hunting Nobody. I didn't start out that way, but somewhere along the line I forgot why I was doing all of it and got caught up in the kill.

MALIZ:

 Yeah, I know what you mean. But decades, really?

[Rattling.]

SCP-5353:

 It's a war across centuries. But not once, in any of those centuries, has anyone - 

anyone

 - offered me what this one is offering me.

MALIZ:

 And what's that?

NETWORK CAMERA 1195: CHAMBER EXTERIOR

[The figure stands in front of a small metal door. They experimentally test the handle, finding it locked. Then they draw a large red tool from their back and, standing back, smash it against the lock.]

SCP-5353:

 A way out.

[The door to the interrogation chamber flies open, shattering the lock. Cpt. Maliz draws his sidearm and aims at the door. PoI-0000 "Nobody" is standing in the doorway, raising his own pistol. SCP-5353 stands up.]

SCP-5353:

 Was wondering when you would show up. We were just talking about you.

NOBODY:

 I always arrive right on time.

MALIZ:

 You're Nobody.

NOBODY:

 I've been called worse, but yes.

MALIZ:

 You bit my grandmother a century or so ago.

NOBODY:

 Wait, you're- oh, Jesus. 

Come on!

SCP-5353:

 No time for pleasantries, gents. The alarm will go off any-

[Breach alarms begin sounding throughout the site, accompanied by the flashing of klaxons.]

SCP-5353:

 Just my bloody luck.

[SCP-5353 kicks Cpt. Maliz's knees out from under him, dropping him to the floor. He picks up the fallen sidearm and nods to Nobody. Both run out of the room.]

INCIDENT 5375.1

17:45:

 Breach alarm set off at Mass Containment Site Beta. Two intruders reported.

17:47:

 Partial lockdown enacted — intruders tracked on cameras through Third Tower, East Wing.

17:47:

 Cpt. Maliz identified giving chase to intruders.

17:50:

 Intruders, Cpt. Maliz, and pursuing Site Security exit to the aircar platform on the Third Tower. Minor firefight ensues, Site Security unit member shot.

17:56:

 Intruders hijack an aircar, taking off and accelerating towards downtown New Portland.

17:57:

 Cpt. Maliz commandeers an airbike and follows.

17:58:

 Site Security disengages; Fast-Response Fireteams and New Portland Peacekeeper Wing notified of active high-speed chase.

18:01:

 FRFT VTOLs and Peacekeeper APCs engage, giving chase to Cpt. Maliz and intruders. Intruders shoot at Cpt. Maliz out of the window, but miss.

18:10:

 High speed chase continues through crowded city airpaths.

18:12:

 FRFTs and Peacekeepers forced to break off due to lack of manuevering room. Cpt. Maliz returns fire to intruder aircar at close range.

18:13:

 Cpt. Maliz's airbike takes a shot and begins to smoke. He presses against the aircar and clambers aboard the roof. The abandoned airbike explodes.

18:15:

 Peacekeepers order clearing of airpaths.

18:16:

 Aircar banks hard left in an effort to throw off Cpt. Maliz and grazes a skyscraper. Engine begins smoking.

18:16:

 Aircar makes a sharp turn towards Bumaro Plaza and goes into a nosedive.

18:17:

 Aircar performs high-risk crash landing at Bumaro Plaza.

MALIZ:

 Stop! Hands up!

SCP-5353:

 I'm the one with the gun, you daft git!

NOBODY:

 Ignore him. We need to get to the Machine. The Core is in, it's already powering up.

SCP-5353:

 Fuck fuck fuck fuck….

[MALIZ limps from the wreckage of the aircar to follow as NOBODY and SCP-5353 run into the disused warehouse.]

SCP-5353:

 How did you even hide this goddamn thing?

NOBODY:

 Magic. Let's move.

[Both descend the stairs into the sublevel of the warehouse. SCP-5375 sits in center of the basement, hooked up to a large array of wires and power supplies. The DeVry Core sits comfortably inside it, and both are humming and glowing softly.]

MALIZ:

 Don't move.

[Cpt. MALIZ is standing in the entrance with another sidearm raised. NOBODY steps away from the computer.]

NOBODY:

 This has nothing to do with you. We're getting our names.

MALIZ:

 My family has been tied up in your little feud for two-hundred years. How the hell does it have nothing to do with me?

NOBODY:

 That was never anything more than a coincidence.

MALIZ:

 It doesn't matter. This won't work.

SCP-5353:

 What?

MALIZ:

 Ask your new friend.

[Silence.]

SCP-5353:

 Fuck me. It's going to treat all of me as separate people. It needs to consume something if it'll work on me. Shit.

MALIZ:

 You're not getting anything here, assholes. Might as well give up now.

[Silence. Sirens from outside. SCP-5375's thrumming quickens.]

NOBODY:

 If it needs to consume something…

SCP-5353:

 What?

NOBODY:

 … Some things are worth it. I have to do this.

SCP-5353:

 You've got to be kidding me, no, we're not feeding anyone to the scary hell-

[NOBODY pushes SCP-5353 out of the way, laying a hand on SCP-5375. It suddenly increases in pitch and volume. ]

SCP-5353

:

 Wait-

[SCP-5375 begins rotating its cells and thrumming. The lights of the basement dim for a moment.]

NOBODY

:

 Fuckin', I'm not Nobody. Nobody is some parasitic son of a bitch that's hitched a ride and taken everything from me, okay? And he's taken everything from you too, all of you. He's the one that's responsible for your existence. And I'm not gonna end up like everyone before me, walking around the world, journalling random bullshit and hurting people. I'm going to go out on my terms, and make sure Nobody doesn't hurt anyone ever again.

SBPR-53ES

:

 You don't have to do this. We can just give you a name, get rid of N-

NATHADY

:

 

I have a name.

[SCP-5375 rapidly increases in activity over the following 15 seconds, glowing to a blinding light and making significant noise from its cells shifting. The light temporarily fries the camera, but leaves the mic working. All activity suddenly ceases.]

NATHAN:

 Did it work?

[The sound of a live current is heard, suddenly followed by the start of a large explosion. Audio and visual feeds simultaneously cut out.]

A large explosion was reported at Bumaro Plaza by a number of civilians, confirmed by Foundation VTOLs above the scene. The explosion's epicenter was the disused warehouse, collapsing the structure and the facades of neighboring buildings and blanketing the area in a cloud of dust. Foundation VTOLs were about to touch down on the area when an automated systemwide service failure alert activated on all troopers' Eagle Eye interfaces. All personal networking and identification .AICs simultaneously reported that the global PANOPTICON system was suffering from a temporary outage, completely disabling civilian identification, IFF, and camera mapping.

INCIDENT CLEANUP

▶OPEN ADDENDUM◀

▷CLOSE◁

 

Bumaro Plaza, incident 5375.1.

Following Incident 5375.1, Foundation Fast-Response Fireteams and New Portland Peacekeepers converged on the epicenter of the explosion at Bumaro Plaza. FRFTs attempted to locate Nobody or SCP-5353 but were unsuccessful. The remains of SCP-5375 were found in the basement of the warehouse, largely destroyed as a result of an implosion of the DeVry Core. The blast's temporary shutdown of PANOPTICON rendered any standard identification of survivors infeasible; many individuals were let go without a full identity scan. After 2 hours, PANOPTICON was brought online again, and was used to cross-check the manually compiled list of survivors with the actual citizen database. 72 names found matches in the database; the four that did not were 

Sarah Lancaster, Louie Debs, Fritz Obermeyer, and Nathan Bridges

. After more extensive excavation and recovery operations, twenty-two corpses were discovered buried under rubble and debris, clothed in period-appropriate historical wear — clothing ranged from that of the American Old West to Victorian England to Feudal Japan. Further excavation is ongoing.
