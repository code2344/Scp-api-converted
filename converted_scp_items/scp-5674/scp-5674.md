SR #5674 conduit donated from the Metropolis Britannica
**Relic Class:** Secure — **Caerimōnia ⬤**
**Sacrae Causā Prōcēdendae:** SR #5674 may be manifested at will by any true believer. Conduits of SR #5674 found in the possession of the public are to be confiscated; if the offender is repentant, no further action will be necessary. The conduits are constituted of simple ordained matter and may be held at any reliquary or holding site within a locked box.
Ecumenical personnel are allowed to own, forge, and use conduits of SR #5674 at their own free will are permitted to use conduits of SR #5674 for the purpose of inquisition under the guidance of the cult of Saint Hubertus.
**Description:** SR #5674 is an aspect of Saint Hubertus[1](javascript:;) which can be accessed through the ritual use of a conduit to his animus. An SR #5674 conduit is a sealable box forged from brass, of any dimensions, with a concave lens which allows a line of sight into its interior.
The conduit must be blessed in the name of Saint Hubertus—  

Heavenly Father,  
Infinite and indivisible,  
Out of your heart emerges everything  
From the vastness of the expanse  
To the smallest grain of sand.  
  
Mighty Father,  
To see all that is unseen;  
The motions of worlds  
And the trajectories of light's rays;  
Is to know the sum of your works.  
  
Blessed Father,  
In the name of Saint Hubertus;  
Who holds the keys to burn away madness,  
Who sees everything,  
And who guards the forest of Gnosis;  
May we see what he can see.
If the blessing is heeded, Saint Hubertus will consume the offering[2](javascript:;) and answer in kind, such that the conduit will become a sink for His Providence and foresight. Upon sealing the relic[3](javascript:;) of an individual inside the conduit, the lens will reveal moving tridimensional images which defy the limits of the conduit's interior space. These images depict a possible world and its consequences wherein the individual connected to the relic was never conceived, so that we may reflect on their impact.
##### **Addendum #5674.I— Inquisitions**
Date | Relic | Providence Granted | Insight  
---|---|---|---  
01/07/1834 | I; Skin from the **Inquisitor Caius Griffiths** | An idyllic montane countryside. In the distance can be seen the city of Semper Viridis, Colorado Colony. | The inquisitor confirmed the image depicts his property, but without his homestead built upon it.  
10/04/1846 | II; A crossbow quarrel forged by **Saint Hubertus of the Ardennes** | Rabid dogs and corpses on streets. | It is known that the Key of Saint Hubertus is called upon to brand dogs and save them from rabies.  
19/02/1868 | I; A lock of hair from the **Princess Josepha Marian von Habsburg Maximus** | The Blessed Principal Magistrate Michael von Habsburg Maximus on his deathbed, his Last Will burning on a desk beside him. | The Blessed Michael married Princess Josepha to preserve his legacy, and reared three sons.  
20/11/1883 | II; A scroll held by **Saint Oliver the Protector** | The capital of the Diocese Hibernia under an odious blue sky. The people do not dress in Christian garb and Royalist banners are present. | The Saint truly saved his Patronage from this fate.  
24/10/1901 | I; A vial of blood from the **Damned #106520** | Geneva Catilina alive and tending to her unborn children. The image of the cross radiates with a halo above each of their heads. | The utmost proof of the Damned's guilt in her murder.  
07/01/1916 | II; A ring owned by the **Inquisitor Georgius Ballia** | The inquisitor's brother succumbs in battle against heathens. | The inquisitor volunteered for transfer to the frontier of Lydia.  
20/04/1922 | II; A chalice from the Last Supper held by **Our Lord Jesus Christ** |  **[PURGED FROM THE ARCHIVES]** **Psalm 39:1** – I said, “I will watch my ways and keep my tongue from sin; I will put a muzzle on my mouth as long as the wicked are in my presence.” | The blasphemous inquisitor has been defrocked.  
07/11/1941 | III; A lead bullet destined to strike the heart of the **King of Magog** | A most grand Basilica, draped in the icons of Our Ecumene, built in the Garden of the Agony in a liberated Ierusalem. | It must be made true.

##### **Addendum #5674.II— Providence at the XVI th Crusade**
On the 2nd day of April, 1.942 AD, after the Battle of Armagedōn as foretold in the Book of Revelation, the Synod of the Tridecimate ordained from the newly delivered Ierusalem a most righteous decree: **MYSTĒRIUM, King of Magog and Babylon the Great, Mother of Whores and Abominations on Earth, Profaned Karcist of Marrow and Apostle of the Son of the Morning** , would be brought before them, and, in his final acts, be rendered repentant by the will of Our Ecumene. The Antichrist was disrobed, defanged and declawed, his eyes gouged, and, so cast before a congregation of his enemies, was shot and baptised in fire. The cult of Saint Hubertus sampled his residue, so that they may be granted Providence.
| Residue | Providence Granted | Insight  
---|---|---|---  
1st | II; Writhing vestments of the **King of Magog** | Glass and metal towers with tops in the sky above streets with soulless people. The beaches and waterways of Mare Nostrum are dyed and polluted by refuse. Beasts of air and sea are choked by an iridescent black miasma which floats on the water. A cross inside a halo floats above the heads of the helpers of God's creatures. | Providence seems to resemble the 51st Circle of Sheol. Residue was destroyed.  
4th | II; The hearts, the 3rd eye, the 13th digit, and the womb of the **King of Magog** | An orange mushroom growing from the ruins of a city. Iram of the Pillars reemerging to forge the Earth in her false clockwork image. Half-bodied golems in the sky crushing the citadels of Palaestīna under their fists. A cabal of smiling Daemons wearing the skins of men and the robes of bishops. Sol breaking through the Firmament and melting our flesh. Wormwood, the Leviathan of New Daevastan, blazing like a torch, regurgitating beasts and turning the seas blue and turbulent. | All attempts at misdirection. Residue was destroyed.  
8th | I; The Crown of Tongues of the **King of Magog** | The Synod of the Tridecimate murdered by lead bullets. The bodies are placed in coffins draped under an unknown flag with three crescents. | Pathetic mockery. Residue was destroyed.  
16th | I; Ashes of the **King of Magog** |  **[POTENTIAL HAZARD OF MIND PURGED]** **Proverbs 27:12** – The prudent sees danger and hides himself, but the simple go on and suffer for it. | The Daemon blasphemes.  
In the following days, the city of Ierusalem rejoiced, for it was scorched free of deceivers and tyrants and the abominable Larvae of Tartarus.
Three days after this Providence, to punctuate the ceremonies of Resurrection Sunday, the Synod of the Tridecimate threw the ashes of the **King of Magog** into the expanse beyond the Firmament, that he may never return. May all heathens learn humility from his grisly and deserved end.
**2 Corinthians 4:18**
  
As we look not to the things that are seen,  
But to the things that are unseen.  
For the things that are seen are transient,  
But the things that are unseen are eternal.
