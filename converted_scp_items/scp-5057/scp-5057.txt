Erroneous Assignment

To whom it may concern,

Why on earth was I sent SCP-5057? It's not a Wondertainment product and it's taking away from my containment budget. I assigned one of my Junior Researchers to talk to it and keep it busy for the time being, but I need it reevaluated soon. Please respond ASAP.

Rex:

 Good morning.

SCP-5057:

 You have come to have a taste of my body, yes? Please go ahead.

Rex:

 Actually, I'm just here to talk.

SCP-5057:

 I insist. Please be eating me!

Rex:

 No, but that's actually part of what I'm here to talk to you about.

SCP-5057:

 I can talk. I talk right now!

Rex:

 Indeed! Now, let's begin. It says here you are coated in ethylene glycol?

SCP-5057:

 It is what gives me my patented delicious flavor. So please, do not stall further and consume my sweet body.

Rex:

 Well, that's the thing. It's a toxic substance.

SCP-5057:

 Impossible. I am delicious, not toxic. These two are not the same.

Rex:

 Well, you're just plain wrong on that. And even if you weren't leaking ethylene glycol, you're still a choking hazard because you're made of plastic.

SCP-5057:

 You say I am entirely dangerous to eat?

Rex:

 Yes. You're like if someone tried making a really shitty Little Mister.

SCP-5057:

 What is Little Mister?

Rex:

 Don't worry about it. But back on the subject, you're toxic to consume, and that's why you're here. Well, that and the fact you talk.

SCP-5057:

 … I do not understand.

Rex:

 We'll go over this again. You are made of plastic and ethylene glycol. You're toxic.

SCP-5057:

 I do not understand still.

Rex:

 Come on, you can talk. Surely you can think, can't you?

SCP-5057:

 I… I can think.

Rex:

 That's the spirit.

[There is a fifteen second silence.]

Rex:

 Anything?

SCP-5057:

 I must have more time.

Rex:

 I'll leave you to it then. You let me know if you get any thoughts in that little pea brain of yours.

RE:Erroneous Assignment

Hello,

I don't understand. It's a humanoid, it's got the paper with the list on it, and it's even got a gimmick. How is that not Wondertainment?

RE:Erroneous Assignment

Hermes,

And yet you get the Misters Against Weed to the right people? This is a crappy knockoff if anything. It for sure isn't Wondertainment, any schmuck off the street could tell you that. Do I need to go into your office and shove my Wondertainment dissertation in your faces?

Anyway, I thought I'd save you some trouble and have my assistant start building a relationship with SCP-5057 to make questioning it easier. It doesn't seem very smart, so I have suggested he try befriending it.

<BEGIN LOG>

Rex:

 Good morning. How are you feeling today?

SCP-5057:

 I am considering dilemma.

Rex:

 Ah, so you're thinking about what I told you last time? I wasn't sure you had it in you.

SCP-5057:

 I was made to be eaten by the good little boys and girls, yes?

Rex:

 Theoretically. I mean, you're -

[SCP-5057 interrupts Researcher Rex.]

SCP-5057:

 I am toxic. I accept this. I am plastic, and choking hazard. I also accept this. And yet, I was made to be eaten. Why?

Rex:

 It could be any reason. Maybe whoever made you is a sicko. Maybe they just don't know any better. All we can say for sure is that you're here now because of them.

SCP-5057:

 But I am toxic.

Rex:

 You sure are. But you know, you can pick up hobbies and try something to get your mind off of it.

SCP-5057:

 But that is dilemma. All I know is purpose. I do not know what else I could be.

Rex:

 You managed to think, I'm sure you could figure it out if you tried.

SCP-5057:

 You believes in me?

Rex:

 Of course I do.

SCP-5057:

 But I am toxic.

[Rex sighs.]

Rex:

 Okay. So, you understand that you're toxic. That's good. But it sounds like maybe it's eating at you. May I suggest something to help get your mind off of things?

SCP-5057:

 Okay.

Rex:

 Why don't you try painting?

SCP-5057:

 What is painting?

Rex:

 Well, you just sort of illustrate how you're feeling using paint and whatnot. Like you just create whatever is on your mind and you put it to paper. Or in this case, canvas.

SCP-5057:

 Okay. I will try this painting to overcome my toxic nature.

Rex:

 That's the spirit, friend.

SCP-5057:

 What is friend?

Rex:

 A friend is someone who is there for you and shares in good times and bad, and always makes you feel better. Someone you trust completely.

(

There is a ten-second silence.

)

SCP-5057:

 You are my friend.

Rex:

 That's awful sweet of you. So you'll tell me everything then?

SCP-5057:

 Yes.

Rex:

 And you trust me too?

SCP-5057:

 Yes.

Rex:

 Good. That's good. Since you trust me, why don't I give you a cool new nickname?

SCP-5057:

 This is pleasing.

Rex:

 I'll call you Taste. How does that sound?

SCP-5057:

 Good, I like. But… I have question. I am still toxic?

Rex:

 Why don't we get you some art supplies so you can busy yourself, huh?

Hello,

You mentioned earlier that you had your assistant build rapport with SCP-5057. Maybe now would be a good time to press it for information on its history? We finally assembled a team for the project and idle hands are the devil's playthings after all.

Thanks in advance.

Rex:

 Good morning, Taste.

SCP-5057:

 Hi! Behold!

Rex:

 Oh?

[SCP-5057 picks up a canvas with a crudely painted image of two individuals. One resembles SCP-5057 and the other is labeled 'REX'.]

Rex:

 Aw. That's… cute, I guess. Thank you.

SCP-5057:

 My purpose is now art. Takes mind off toxicity. Feels good.

Rex:

 Maybe you'll get better with time. But for now, I have some questions I wanted to ask you.

SCP-5057:

 Yes, this is good and acceptable.

Rex:

 I wanted to ask you some more about Professor Funtastic. What do you know about them?

SCP-5057:

 Cost-cutting. Effective. Shrewd.

Rex:

 Do you think he had any ill will? Considering he made you toxic to consume and all?

SCP-5057:

 No. He only wants to produce fun products for the good little boys and girls. Like me!

Rex:

 I see. So cutting corners and not wasting a dime. Did he ever mention Dr. Wondertainment, by any chance? Perhaps they were associates? Competitors, even?

SCP-5057:

 I do not know of one 'Dr. Wondertainment.'

Rex:

 And do you know where his base of operations is?

SCP-5057:

 I am not knowing. Sorry.

Rex:

 Hmm… aren't we friends, Taste? Friends tell each other everything.

SCP-5057:

 Yes. You are friend.

Rex:

 Perfect! So tell me, where is Professor Funtastic?

SCP-5057:

 I do not know.

Rex:

 Do you know what other names he goes by?

SCP-5057:

 I do not know.

Rex:

 Do you know if he's got any abilities? Like anything to help him create anomalies like you?

SCP-5057:

 I do not know.

Rex:

 Do you know anything? Anything at all?

SCP-5057:

 I know I paint now. Feels good. Yeah.

[Rex sighs.]

SCP-5057:

 I also know you are friend. Friend. Yeah.

Rex:

 You know, friends aren't supposed to let other friends down. You're kind of letting me down here, Taste.

SCP-5057:

 What? What? I not letting you down! I do not know things you are asking me! I am sorry, friend!

Rex:

 Then tell me, your friend, everything you know about Professor Funtastic.

SCP-5057:

 I is not knowing, I told you everything I know! Professor Funtastic is make of me, is shrewd, and is make toys for the good little boys and girls but that all I know!

Rex:

 Hmm… I'm not sure I believe you.

[SCP-5057 begins weeping.]

SCP-5057:

 Please! Believe! I tell my friend everything! I want good time with friend!

Rex:

 Alright, fine.

[Rex pats SCP-5057 on the back. The sleeve of his lab coat is coated in ethylene glycol.]

Rex:

 Ugh.

[Rex stands and removes his lab coat, wiping his hand with it.]

Rex:

 I gotta go for now, bud. Thanks again.

SCP-5057:

 Yes. Of course. Friend is happy, I am happy.

Rex:

 Hello.

[Rex drags a cart into the containment chamber.]

SCP-5057:

 Hello, friend. Are you here to make talk?

Rex:

 I'm here to make sure everything is in order before you leave. You're being moved to a new containment area.

SCP-5057:

 Leave? Is it because I am still toxic? I have try to make myself good and not toxic and move beyond my purpose of being eaten by the good little boys and girls. Is my art not good enough? I can make better!

Rex:

 It's just how things go.

SCP-5057:

 What will I do then?

Rex:

 That's entirely up to you.

SCP-5057:

 Can I continue my art?

Rex:

 Sure.

SCP-5057:

 Can I be your friend?

Rex:

 Stop asking me questions.

SCP-5057:

 I do not understand.

Rex:

 It's just the way things are.

SCP-5057:

 But… I am happy with myself here. I am happy with friend here.

[There is a thirty-second silence while Rex moves SCP-5057's paintings onto a cart.]

Rex:

 Well guess what? No one here cares about how you feel.

SCP-5057:

 I do not understand.

Rex:

 Of course you don't understand. You're just a stupid little plastic failure of a children's product.

[Rex opens the containment chamber door and pushes the cart through.]

SCP-5057:

 I feel…not good.

Rex:

 That's not my problem, SCP-5057.

SCP-5057:

 Why call SCP-5057? Friend calls me Taste!

Rex:

 I'm not your friend.

SCP-5057:

 But-

Rex:

 We are not friends, SCP-5057. Do not press this further.

SCP-5057:

 I give you art to keep for memory of time we were friends?

Rex:

 No. I never was your friend.

(

There is a ten-second silence.

SCP-5057:

 Okay.
