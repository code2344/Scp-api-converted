Special Containment Procedures:

SCP-8737 is to be kept in a locked room of the cyber containment branch of Research Site-87. The electronic device containing SCP-8737 is to be locked under the standard Schwartz security program. The electrical system connected to this device is to be separated from the main site network. Foundation web crawlers are to monitor for any SCP-8737-A instances on video-sharing sites, which upon discovery will be summarily deleted.

No personnel with level 2 security clearance and above, are to view SCP-8737-A. Any such viewing of SCP-8737-A is to be considered a Class 5 information security breach.

Testing of SCP-8737 is currently forbidden under Internal Affairs Directive-2451. Project Little Mnemosyne is currently suspended by the Intelligence Agency.

Description:

SCP-8737 is a computer folder containing SCP-8737-A and SCP-8737-B, labeled “Project PCM”.

SCP-8737-A is a computer folder containing a full-length anime original series, consisting of 13 episodes, each episode exactly 23 minutes in length. Exposure to SCP-8737-A's content induces an anti-memetic effect on its subject, rendering complete amnesia about its content. Despite this, reviews of SCP-8737-A have described it as "blissful". Due to the nature of SCP-8737-A, it is currently unknown whether SCP-8737-A instances are still in public circulation.

SCP-8737-B is a computer folder containing 17,347

1

 videos. Videos vary in length, with most being a few minutes long.

2

 Despite the large number of video files, SCP-8737-B only occupies 10 MB of storage data.

Videos in SCP-8737-B show a memory belonging to the subjects of SCP-8737-A, with one video associated with each subject. It is unknown if the memory taken from the subject is randomly selected or otherwise. Repeated viewings of SCP-8737-A do not generate additional video files within SCP-8737-B. The duration of the video generated in SCP-8737-B is independent of the duration of SCP-8737-A viewed by the subject.

Most videos appear to be from unsuspecting members of the public, though there are also memories of a few Foundation and GoI members present.

3

 Contents of SCP-8737-B cannot be reproduced, transferred, or deleted. It is unknown if the Foundation possesses the sole instance of SCP-8737-B.

Discovery:

On 19/01/18, SCP-8737 was discovered by Junior Researcher Leon Watts while working on his Foundation workstation. Upon discovery, the unknown folder was immediately reported to relevant authorities. Classification of its anomalous properties began shortly after, with the workstation being confiscated and contained.

SCP-8737’s origins are currently unknown.

Addendum:

The unique property of SCP-8737’s memory-capturing capabilities, presented a potential avenue for Foundation espionage and intelligence-gathering operations. To assess this, Project Little Mnemosyne was proposed and initiated. Under the Project, relevant PoIs were remotely exposed to SCP-8737-A via compromised digital terminals. Resulting SCP-8737-B videos were subsequently cataloged and analyzed by the Foundation Intelligence Agency.

Following the suspension of Project Little Mnemosyne by the Intelligence Agency, the results of the project have been compiled together with prior experimental logs.

Video depicts subject holding their child in their hands for the first time.

No information associated with relevant GoIs were discernable. No actionable intelligence was received.

PoI-1142 (Suspected GoI member)

3:24

Video depicts subject fighting a Type Blue. The fight ends with the subject pulling out an unknown weapon, and subsequently erasing their enemy from existence.

Information received was analysed and cross-referenced with known incidents and reliable sources. No matches were found. Further external investigations into PoI-1142 revealed they were a newer member of the GoI. A final joint report by Foundation psychologists and information specialists indicated the memory depicted was more likely to be a dream, rather than an actual experience. Project Little Mnemosyne was then suspended by the Intelligence Agency.

Addendum: Incident-8737-1

On 24th December, an unauthorized access attempt was detected by Schwartz security system. Researcher Leon Watts bypassed required authentication systems and viewed SCP-8737-A. Though Foundation security apprehended Watts within 5 minutes, an SCP-8737-B video file had already been generated. Watts was observed weeping, watching his generated video file.

Researcher Leon Watts

Video depicts subject's father playing catch with him when he was a child.

Watts' father died on 12/12/18 after suffering a stroke.

Following the incident, Watts was sent for processing under the Internal Affairs Department. Special consideration was given in this incident at the Site Director's decision and with Ethics Committee approval. Rather than traditional measures that would have slowed Watts' career at the Foundation, Watts was instead administered Class C amnestics to wipe any memory of his father.

As of 24/05/19, Researcher Leon Watts has been re-assigned to Area-05 and is reportedly exceeding expectations.
