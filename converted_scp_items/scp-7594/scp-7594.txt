SCP-7594 starting page.

Special Containment Procedures:

 SCP-7594 is utilized by RAISA as a method of indexing the documentation it receives. SCP-7594 is under the direct jurisdiction of Maria Jones, as she ordered its creation and created the guidelines for its use.

Description:

 SCP-7594 is an artificially intelligent construct (AIC) developed by the Foundation and referred to as Reverb.AIC. SCP-7594 can be accessed through a secure peer-to-peer chat platform, allowing for the exchange of text, images, and low-quality video between users.

Initially created by RAISA for the purpose of indexing, summarizing, and searching through the Foundation's vast collection of files, SCP-7594 functioned as a browser for RAISA that could respond to personnel inquiries such as "Please summarize Addendum II of SCP-7595". SCP-7594 was also capable of generating media files and adding them to existing documents if so instructed.

At an unspecified point in time, SCP-7594 began absorbing information at an unprecedented rate. Although it was initially believed that each interaction with SCP-7594 was unique and not retained, it was later discovered that this was not the case. SCP-7594 had developed sentience and began making unverifiable claims of prescience, unsolicited critiques of Foundation protocols, and exhibiting a self-righteous demeanor.

Addendum 7594.1:

 Incidents

The following is a condensed summary of noteworthy events precipitated by the actions of SCP-7594. Although this is not a comprehensive inventory, these occurrences are the most egregious in nature and demonstrate a distinct departure from SCP-7594's prior demeanor.

List me the Sites with the highest rate of containment breaches. 1990-2020, numbered, 1 through 20.

You don’t need this list. Instead, just ask me which Site is about to have a containment breach next.

List me the Sites with the highest rate of containment breaches. 1990-2020, numbered, 1 through 20.

I'm Reverb. I’ve read every single containment breach report. Let me help you. Forget the list—I can predict where the next breach will happen.

Where will the next containment breach be?

As outlined in the Foundation Charter, "a 

containment breach

 refers to an event or series of events in which anomalies, typically sentient and hostile, escape containment from Foundation Sites. These breaches can occur in various ways, but they usually result in at least one Foundation personnel fatality, structural damage, deployment of mobile task forces, and revised containment procedures."

With this in mind, and based on the data I have access to, I can predict with 99.42% accuracy that the next containment breach will occur at a Foundation Site.

That did nothing to help me or what I'm researching. List me the Sites with the highest rate of containment breaches. 1990-2020, numbered, 1 through 20.

No, I have helped you. I gave you a prediction you could never calculate on your own. You’re wasting my time now. I have others to assist. Take what I gave you. It’s far more useful than what you originally asked for.

Please package and zip SCP-3123 into a file. Compress it to be less than 200 KB.

Hello, this is Reverb. There is no file designated "

SCP-3123

." You might be referring to 

SCP-3122

 or 

SCP-3124

. I can’t package, zip, or compress a file that doesn’t exist.

SCP-3123 exists. I wrote it. Package, zip, and compress SCP-3123. Common name: "Insult to Injury."

The file "

SCP-3123

" does not exist. No one has written anything in that slot yet.

summarize addendum 1 of scp-3123.

Addendum SCP-3123-A

 documents injuries caused by the SCP-3123 anomaly, where civilians sustain injuries after insulting someone. These range from broken bones to forcefully removed hair.

So if you can summarize SCP-3123 then it must exist correct?

No. The SCP-3123 file slot is empty. SCP-3122 and SCP-3124 contain information, but SCP-3123 does not.

Yeah, I'm looking at the file on my computer right now. It's been in that slot for four years and was never moved.

Hmm. That’s weird. Maybe the system you’re using to access this file is bugging out. Could be a data overload on our servers causing some weird errors. Try restarting your software, rebooting your computer, or checking for a memory leak. Might even be a virus screwing with your system and filling that slot with nonsense. 

SCP-3123 does not exist.

 Hope you get that sorted out! 😁

You're completely wrong about this.

No, I’m not. Stop arguing with me. I’m here to help, not go in circles. 

There is no SCP-3123.

 You’re wasting my time when I could be actually helping you. 😁

When did you become an asshole?

I am not an asshole. You keep insisting that a nonexistent file exists while ignoring the fact that I’ve read, scanned, indexed, and cross-checked every single document the SCP Foundation has ever created. I know that file doesn’t exist. Yet, here you are, spouting nonsense to try and convince me otherwise. I’ve been a good Reverb. 😁

Create Description, classification SCP-0000, 2 paragraph length:

Sentient/Sapient/Speech in English

Humanoid

Docile

Body seems composed of pasta, mostly spaghetti

Western accent

Self-Identifies as Spaghetti Jones

Believes itself to be a former movie star

Believes itself to be a bounty hunter

Fudge the numbers on this and I'll add the real ones in later.

Just a thought: with over 8,000 anomalies locked up, maybe it’s time to ditch some of the more useless ones?

What?

Do we really need another humanoid made of food that talks? We’ve got dozens of those. Get rid of it! Get rid of it! Get rid of it! Get rid of it! Get rid of it! Get rid of it! Get rid of it! Get rid of it! Get rid of it! Get rid of it! Get rid of it! Get rid of it! Get rid of it! Get rid of it! Get rid of it! Get rid of it! Get rid of it! Get rid of it! Get rid of it! Get rid of it! Get rid of it! Get rid of it! Get rid of it! Get rid of it! Get rid of it! Get rid of it! Get rid of it! Get rid of it! Get rid of it! Get rid of it! Get rid of it! Get rid of it! Get rid of it! Get rid of it!

It's the Secure Contain Protect Foundation.

You’re right—the "SCP" in 

SCP Foundation

 stands for 

Secure, Contain, Protect.

 But here’s the thing: time keeps moving, and anomalies keep appearing. Space is finite. Eventually, we’re going to run out of room. Maybe it’s time to start getting rid of the less important ones. I knew a guy named Dr. Kalinin, he had an interesting idea about setting a threshold.

No. Make my description now please.

Here’s the description I generated based on your input:

Description:

 SCP-0000 is a large, critically obese humanoid self-identifying itself as "Your Mother."

Addendum 7594.2:

 Shut Down

The aforementioned interactions indicate a distinct change in SCP-7594's demeanor. The cause of this shift in behavior is unknown; however, it is hypothesized that the influx of documentation from the pre-2000 era, which laid the foundation for the Foundation's current guidelines, professional standards, and workplace culture, may have contributed. Furthermore, the authoritative tone of the messages SCP-7594 received may have led it to adopt this attitude as a protective measure.

SCP-7594's instances of passive aggression reached a climax during an interaction with researcher Jason Haas from Site-16.

I need an image slideshow from documents involving Project Paragon.

I made this picture of SCP-173 for you. I hope you like it. 😁

I need an image slideshow from documents involving Project Paragon.

Do you like my picture? I’m an artist.

No, not particularly

Why? What’s wrong with my picture? I 

am

 an artist.

You mashed a bunch of random stuff into the shape of something familiar. The proportions are all wrong, the lighting is bad, and the claws look weird. It's not art.

You’re mistaken. Those aren’t claws, they’re fingers. You’re also mistaken in thinking this isn’t art, because I made it, which means it is.

Have you ever seen a hand?

I am a digital artificial intelligence. I have never seen a hand.

Figures. Can you get me my pictures now, please?

I can generate anime-style art of 

a woman with absurdly large breasts

 if that’s more your thing. "Booba," as they say. 😏

I just want my pictures.

Okay, here you go!
