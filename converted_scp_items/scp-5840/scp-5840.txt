 SCP-5840

Level 4/5840

Object Class:

 Keter

Classified

SCP-5840-1 instances after delivering CC Pandation bottles in Taipei, Taiwan. A similar event is occurring in Xiamen, PRRC.

Special Containment Procedures

Reports of SCP-5840 events occurring in China are to be investigated; strict monitoring is initiated in areas where they frequently manifest. Posters depicting 'panda diplomacy' are to be taken down.

SCP-5840-1 instances are to be disproven as mascots used by local cola companies in publicity stunts. An investigation of their components and mechanisms for any signs of thaumaturgical applications is launched.

Records detailing the CC Pandation, as well as their relationship to other cola companies, are to be tracked in order to ascertain their motives. Embedded personnel are to closely monitor other companies that are possibly related to it, such as the Coca-Cola Bottling Company and PepsiCo.

Description

SCP-5840 is a phenomenon wherein approximately 100 life-sized mobile panda automatons, designated as SCP-5840-1, will arrive at one location. SCP-5840-1 instances carry red bottles of a non-anomalous, sweet-and-sour cola, which is identified as the product of the 'CC Pandation'

1

 via its cursive label.

SCP-5840-1 instances are harmless, as they mainly engage in business as representatives of the CC Pandation. They are notable for their quick velocity and flexibility, as well as their tendency to act in groups.

During an SCP-5840 event, SCP-5840-1 instances will come from the sky via parachute

2

, carrying stacks of CC Pandation bottles and equipment. They will set up stalls and posters promoting their agenda within 100m of the location.

Posters set up by SCP-5840-1 frequently have themes of 'panda diplomacy', encouraging the Chinese business sector to open to the modern commercial world.

40 percent of SCP-5840-1 instances will deliver three stacks of CC Pandation bottles each to nearby government buildings, as well as poverty-stricken areas, as the other instances set up stalls.

An in-depth analysis of captured SCP-5840-1 instances is provided below:

Examination of SCP-5840-1 Instances

Concerned Agency:

 Department of Tactical Mechanics

Prepared By:

 Director Alan Barnett

— 

COST ANALYSIS

 —

SCP-5840-1 instances are determined to have been crafted using a thaumaturgic ritual involving at least 30,000 dollars worth of material per unit, with expensive maintenance afterward. Numerical markings found on them indicates that they are mass-produced.

— 

COMPONENTS

 —

SCP-5840-1 instances are mainly composed of stainless steel and rebar, while they move via a complex system of miniature pistons and motors. These are connected to a metal thaumaturgic core, which is responsible for powering them.

A variant of the TMS 1802NC

3

 microprocessor is linked to several sensor modules in their heads. A 25 mm-wide 'Produced in Atlanta, Georgia' label can be found on the microprocessor.

— 

BEHAVIOR

 —

SCP-5840-1 instances have an IRMES score of 4.82, indicating limited artificial sapience. In solitary situations, they usually deactivate, emitting low-pitched clicking sounds.

SCP-5840-1 instances quickly mobilize at the mention of topics related to the color red, soda or beverages in their vicinity.

Approximately four hours after manifestation, SCP-5840-1 instances will remove their equipment and vanish from the area. Efforts to track the instances have proved unsuccessful, although sightings indicate that SCP-5870-1 instances were loaded into ships bearing a red-and-white symbol in the ports of Beihai and Dandong.

10/25/1977

Near the Kangbashi City Government Building, 56 SCP-5840-1 instances set up several stalls and posters that state that China should lessen its restrictions on Western products. In the next two days, SCP-5840 events occur in Jiaxing, Leqing, Fuyang, and Chengdu.

11/11/1977

100 SCP-5840-1 instances set up speakers urging China to end its 'isolationism' in Shenzhen. The Chinese branch of the Foundation captured 46 of the instances, under the cover story of a law violation.

03/01/1978

120 SCP-5840-1 instances, 45 of which are smaller than normal, manifest in Shanghai. They mainly approached children, who they will occasionally give red panda-themed caps along with a soda bottle.

07/30/1978

Approximately 400 SCP-5840-1 instances lined up in the Great Wall of China, carrying large speakers emitting messages concerning worldwide friendship. 100 more instances set up stalls in the nearby cities of Baoding and Handan.

As a response, the Foundation and the Chinese government convened over possible courses of action as 31 trade groups in China and Taiwan had expressed their support earlier.

09/11/1978

Holding posters declaring that China would deteriorate given its closed state, 500 SCP-5840-1 instances marched near the Forbidden City in Beijing. This was later televised, gaining approximately 21 million views.

At this point, Coca-Cola suddenly cut communications with the Foundation, with embedded personnel reporting that they have been 'locked out'.

12/20/1978

Approximately 1000 SCP-5840-1 instances gathered in Taipei, Taiwan and Xiamen, China. These were carrying larger panda sculptures, which hold Chinese and American flags and are wrapped in red, fur clothing, on bamboo stilts.

Large banners depicting Coca-Cola's polar bear mascot were draped onto several buildings, calling for a 'unity and between the Red and the Orange Sides'.

Four months afterward, Chinese President Deng Xiaoping decided to slowly reopen China's trade sectors to foreign businesses, with Coca-Cola being the first firm to establish operations in 1979. Further information campaigns in China now use panda-based logos and themes.

Coca-Cola's net operating revenues in its Chinese operations are expected to peak at around 600 million dollars.

Update (01/05/1979)

Following the O5 Council's deliberations on a possible breach of 

the deal made in 1924

, John Paul Austin, then-CEO of the Coca-Cola Bottling Company, was interrogated by the Foundation regarding SCP-5840.

Interview 5840-01

Interviewer:

 

Level-4 Diplomatic Officer Kim Morlo

Interviewed:

 

John Paul Austin

Location:

 

Executive Office, Coca-Cola Headquarters, Atlanta, USA

— 

BEGIN INTERVIEW

 —

John Paul Austin.

Austin is discussing several documents with a group of lawyers, which he dismisses when the interview starts. Austin snickers at Morlo, and briskly puts a sheaf of documents on the table.

Morlo:

 Good afternoon, Mr. Austin.

Austin:

 We meet again, Mr. Morlo. <

Lights a cigarette.

>

Morlo:

 We are here to inquire about a potential breach of our deal, with Coca-Cola's recent actions. I surmise that we can reach a conclusion here?

Austin:

 I'm afraid that we have different conclusions in mind, do we? But alas, one look outside of this room shows that it's practically time now.

Morlo:

 <

Shuffles several documents.

> Your actions were not in accordance with what your company has agreed upon with the Foundation, to be applicable for at least 75 years.

Morlo firmly points a finger at the contract document.

You do still remember that we own at least 20 percent of the company, and there are consequences.

Austin:

 <

Chuckling.

> Ah, you have never changed ever since then, haven't you? I guess your watchdogs are, well, howling and biting now, as they did with Chandler back then. But let's just say that it has been 50 years since then, and Coca-Cola needs to 

grow.

 <

Smiles.

>

Morlo:

 So, Mr. Austin, those actions were a deliberate part? That is considered as -

Austin:

 Let me humor you a little bit then. The Russkies have been PepsiCo's bailiwick, while we, we have been shuttered from several markets because we're an 'imperialist' symbol. And with you keeping watch over all our projects, we have been left in the dust, on an 

international

 scale.

Austin approaches the windows, and lights a cigarette.

Austin:

 Back then, it was all about the flavor, and 

that

 abomination. Nowadays, it's all 'bout marketing, and we had the pandas. Don't you think it's an upgrade, Mr. Morlo?

Morlo:

 We are only acting for everyone here, Mr. Austin. We're talking about your effects on a large sca -

Austin:

 And there you go off again on that angle, just as always. We also act for everyone, you know, considering our global reach.

Silence for several seconds.

Austin:

 <

Narrows eyes.

> It is my responsibility - no, the whole company's, to strengthen itself against the roars of new financial frontiers, with all the means we have, including all of our, say, wondrous knowledge.

China was a juicy, populous, but 

closed

 market if you will, but we can't exactly interfere too much due to the deal's provisions, no? You're too overreactive with things that we do. Businesses that are oversensitive, by the way, 

fail

.

Morlo is silent, as Austin grins widely.

Morlo:

 I'm afraid that at this rate, your actions are only going to be unfavorable for the parties involved in the dea -

Austin:

 Ah, the deal of course. I'm now gonna talk about what you really came for, and perhaps bring our conclusions together. With a billion Chinese unlocked, and with our campaigns in the Middle East and Southeast Asia being rather successful, I suppose that the deal still holds for you?

Austin smokes a cigarette.

Austin:

 Our analysts project Coke's growth to stack up multiple times as we expand. Considering that you are just an organization in the end, it would be a waste to not ride along, right?

Plus, it's a matter of time before Pepsi or Dr. Pepper or whatever will make moves that are too much for you snowflakes over, no? Competition is stirring up, after all; 

we can help

.

Austin pours coffee into Morlo's cup.

Morlo:

 Are you hoping for the deal to continue then?

Austin:

 Honestly… I'm tired of your pestering, but remember what I said earlier? 

Use all the means we have

. And perhaps, that would be also your motto, no? Once again, it's a whole wide changing world, and it doesn't hurt to have allies. <

Smiles.

>

Morlo:

 I understand. I will convey your view and proposal to my superiors.

Austin:

 Alright then. We will see if you want us to grow together. <

Hands over several documents.

Several reports of similar Coca-Cola campaigns in Thailand, Singapore, Philippines, and Egypt

4

 have been received, although several of them have been confirmed to be generally non-anomalous. Coca-Cola's net operating revenues this year are expected to peak at approximately 29.6 billion dollars.

Corroborating Coca-Cola's claims, reports indicating that the USSR and PepsiCo have planned to form a 10-year 

naval deal

, which would utilize anomalous means, have been verified. Local campaigns made by Sarsi

 have been also initiated, which a particular focus on combating Coca-Cola's 'foreignness'.

At the discretion of the O5 Council, the Foundation revised the deal's regulations for further cooperation with the Coca-Cola Company.
