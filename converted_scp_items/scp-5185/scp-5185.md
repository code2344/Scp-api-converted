**Item #:** SCP-5185
**Object Class:** Safe
**Special Containment Procedures:** Instances of SCP-5185 are to be located and secured by Site-37 staff. SCP-5185 instances are to be contained in a dog day care center within Site-37 with a chain link fence separating them from research personnel.
**Description:** SCP-5185 are an unclassified subspecies of giant house spider _(Eratigena atrica)._ Each possesses the physical, psychological, and social needs of an average domesticated canine. When first brought into Foundation care, each SCP-5185 instance was approximately the size of a six to ten week-old puppy, with their internal biology modified to allow them to survive at this size. Each instance has since grown to the size of a border collie _(45.72 cm - 55.88 cm tall)._ SCP-5185 instances also have a base level of intelligence congruent with that of an average border collie.
SCP-5185 instances have been observed showing aggressive behaviour towards staff, charging at researchers while making high pitched noises similar to growling, biting the chain link fence, and lunging.
Instances of SCP-5185 were purchased from a renovated Coca-Cola branded vending machine on the sidewalk of 6th Street, Macaque, Il. The dispenser, designated SCP-5185-A, had five compartments made from plexiglas with a fleece blanket at the bottom of every compartment. Each contained one instance of SCP-5185. Despite what is advertised on the flyer, no purchase from SCP-5185-A has produced anything matching the description of a "fine dog."
