SCP-6927
**Item #:** SCP-6927
**Object Class:** Safe
**Colloquial Designation:** Eurydification
**Special Containment Procedures:** Due to the naturally low profile and cooperative nature of SCP-6927-A and SCP-6927-B full containment was deemed unnecessary. Objects’ online and off-line activities are to be monitored and they are to report to a foundation-controlled medical facility for all physical and mental health maintenance. Objects are to be apprehended only if they cease to comply with protocols. Surplus writings, recordings, and visual art produced by 6927-B are to be retained for analysis under the designation 6927-B2. The commissioning of 6927-B and 6927-B2 for covert operations is summissible to level 3 personnel, providing it does not compromise the objects. References to a “Clinic” of a similar nature to that mentioned in the interviews are to be investigated under priority 2.
**Description:** SCP-6927-A is a 1.7 meter human male weighing 75.2 kilograms. It appears to be of Eastern European ancestry and between the ages of 40 and 50. Object identifies as Troian Berryhill and cites its age at 43. It has submitted records confirming name and date of birth.
Object is host to an alternate personality that may originate from two clusters of cerebral tissue located adjacent to its adrenal glands. Surgical scars indicate the tissue and its surrounding membranes may have been either deliberately implanted or modified at some point after the object’s birth. Cerebral tissue appears inactive with nerve signals inconsistently registered. DNA tests on tissue are currently inconclusive.
Primary object exhibits no memory of events taking place during personality transitions (which are instantaneous) other than a sense of missing time. Alternate personality identifies itself as Camilla Torres (6927-B). 6927-B has proven itself to be the more accessible of the two objects, with 6927-A being more likely to converse with those it perceives as civilians. Despite this, communication with 6927-B is difficult.
Sound produced by 6927-A and 6927-B is identical with some variation in voice pattern and tone. Information imparted by 6927-B is un-retainable after 5 to 10 minutes. During this time, it is possible to convey some information to a second party before loss of data. This is possible only by direct word of mouth and should be imprecise. Recordings and transcripts of 6927-B’s voice as well as audio and visual works produced by it are likewise un-retainable.
Despite this, 6927-A itself is retainable in memory though recollections of communications with the secondary object are often lost, leading to a general sense of disquiet when 6927-B manifests.
**Discovery:** SCP-6927-A is employed at foundation finance office 6IJ dealing with the documentation of unclassified funds. Instances of “lost or missing time” were reported on several occasions and traced to a specific archivist. Missing time was found to be due to a memory effect that occurred when 6927-A was over-stressed, causing the manifestation of a new personality. Initial contact was made through infrequent details recalled by second party witnesses.
New personality claimed to be 6927-A but was often disoriented and never able to recall 6927-A’s recent prior actions within satisfactory perimeters. 6927-B grew more cooperative after a CT scan revealed the presence of cerebral tissue structures and a biopsy confirmed abnormality. During initial proceedings, 6927-A personality was unobserved.
#### Addendum 1 - Interview
Some declassification of foundation activities eventually induced 6927-B to agree to a formal interview. As interviews are filmed and recorded in accordance with standard procedure, the media containing the information could be stored for later transcription via second party recollection as files containing 6927-B media such as digital documents or physical drives and papers are, despite their contents, not themselves un-retainable.
\+ Open Interview
(Some have reported difficulty with opening the above interview. This may be due to a memory effect as no problems with file code have been noted. Repeating the following aloud between 3 to 5 times and proceeding to the following modified copy may ensure retention of data.)  
  

### Between the eye’s closing and opening,
### all is beholden to the whims of the unfettered mind,
### for we are the many who sleep.
  

If failure to remember the following interview still occurs despite several attempts, assistance should be sought from an approved associate.
[\+ Open Interview ](javascript:;)
[Access Granted ](javascript:;)
**Date:** July 10, 1100 HOURS (11:00 AM) 2020  
**Location:** Temporary holding apartment, South sector, Site 62  
**Videographer:** Mark Kegans  
**Interviewer:** Site Psychologist Dr. Alva Nordstrom  
**Interviewed:** SCP-6927-B
**Description:** SCP-6927-A was contained temporarily pending evaluation. Friends and family were informed of an “Unplugged Vacation.”
* * *
**Dr. Nordstrom:** Alright, how long do I have before I start to forget all of this?
**SCP-6927-B:** How often do you remember your dreams?
**Dr. Nordstrom:** May I ask why this happens?
**SCP-6927-B:** May I ask why a person surrounded by reality’s rejects has never seen this before? Existing is hard, even incompletely.
**Dr. Nordstrom:** Is there a chance we could hear from Troian?
**SCP-6927-B:** Perhaps, eventually. I’d have to get him out of here and back to his usual routine. That, and you’d have approach him like sane human beings and not MIBs. He has enough trouble handling one reality, I don’t think he’d respond so well to all this Illuminati stuff.
**Dr. Nordstrom:** Can he hear us?
**SCP-6927-B:** Fortunately, no. Right now he’s off, effectively dead. I can wake him up once things calm down, and see if he wants to “take the wheel” but first I’ll need to get him back home, and convince him you’re just from the clinic.
**Dr. Nordstrom:** The Clinic?
**SCP-6927-B:** Thought you’d be affiliated with those guys. They put me in touch with Troian after he talked about wanting to harm himself. I used to know him, but can’t recall much of our relationship before they installed the links.
**Dr. Nordstrom:** They?
**SCP-6927-B:** The Oneiroi, they told me he required therapeutic negation.
**Dr. Nordstrom:** What did that mean?
**SCP-6927-B:** You ready for this? It’s pretty heavy for a newb.
**Dr. Nordstrom:** (Here Dr. Nordstrom silently mouthed something. Interpretation from video recording approximates the phrase - “But there are many more who sleep.”) *
**SCP-6927-B:** Very well then. Those who seek the void are often told to turn back. None seem to understand that it’s the natural state of all. To not exist is normal. Relatively few are ultimately snared by immutable matter and assembled into forms, the illness is brief - but it’s not what any void dweller was designed for.
**Dr. Nordstrom:** Is this why Troian wanted to harm himself?
**SCP-6927-B:** Indeed. But there were other, far less invasive, ways to give him what he so desperately desired. Instead of turning him away like all the others, I knew what he was looking for and was able to share it.
**Dr. Nordstrom:** Is this what they do at the clinic?
**SCP-6927-B:** Perhaps it’s all they do, perhaps Troian was a special case. I only know what I am doing now and that is helping Troian through his illness.
**Dr. Nordstrom:** Is being alive an illness?
**SCP-6927-B:** It is for Troian. Perhaps it’s not for you.
**Dr. Nordstrom:** You said you once knew Troian? Are you by any chance what some might call - deceased?
**SCP-6927-B:** I know what he is going through as I too was forced to endure it, if that’s what you mean.
**Dr. Nordstrom:** Would you say you are currently nonexistent?
**SCP-6927-B:** Yes.
**Dr. Nordstrom:** May I ask how you can think?
**SCP-6927-B:** Negative space is still a specific imprint on positive things.
**Dr. Nordstrom:** Is Troian aware of you?
**SCP-6927-B:** Aware enough, at night I turn off his brain, and he is able to have what life denies him. I occupy the empty space in order to sustain the body and its memory. During the day - assuming we are left alone, we trade places again.
**Dr. Nordstrom:** How is this different from normal sleep?
**SCP-6927-B:** Being temporarily erased, removed, from the hazardous demands of this often parasitic reality and exposed to a lack of it, fuels a vital part of him.
**Dr. Nordstrom:** Is this hard for you?
**SCP-6927-B:** It won’t take long. Life ends eventually. As for Troian well, he’s not a morning person, but toward evening he perks up, finishes work, tends his plants, goes for walks, does some light reading, I talk to his friends so that’s how I know. It’s healthy stuff if you ask me. You should have seen him when he was being pressured to “achieve.” Catch him then, if you want to ask how he’s doing.
**Dr. Nordstrom:** (shakes hands with SCP-6927-B) Thank you for your cooperation - my apologies if the others gave you any trouble.
**SCP-6927-B:** (laughs) This wasn’t our first rodeo.
*(Dr. Nordstrom did not - as was assumed - forget the interview. This was discovered when a colleague reported that they had later shared details.
Dr. Nordstrom was questioned about the phrase used during the interview and they provided the extended version used for 6927-B memory retention. Claims to not recall where they learned it. Suggested 6927-B had shared it with them in an unremembered exchange. Potential exchanges had been filmed on security cameras and can not be ruled out.
Dr. Nordstrom has nonetheless been suspected of affiliation with the Kroenburg Institute, a university purported to train civilians in classified subjects. Dr. Nordstrom denies this. Due to multiple successes with sentient objects in the past they have retained their position albeit with increased supervision.)
  

#### Addendum 2 - Interview with Primary Object
SCP-6927-A does not affect memory. It can however be instantaneously supplanted by SCP-6927-B when emotionally overwhelmed. The extent to which this is voluntary on the part of either object is unknown, as both objects have referred to the other “taking over.”
6927-A fears foundation personnel. This is consistent with reports from 6927-B. 6927-A has been found to be less likely to panic when engaged with persons it feels are unaffiliated.

[Access Granted ](javascript:;)
**Date:** August 25, 1700 HOURS (5:00 PM) 2020  
**Location:** SCP-6927-A’s residence  
**Videographer:** Mark Kegans  
**Interviewer:** Site Psychologist Dr. Alva Nordstrom  
**Interviewed:** SCP-6927-A
**Description:** Objects were returned to prior living conditions. Contact with primary object for the purposes of a formal interview was achieved after a waiting period of 46 days. Waiting period was enacted due to the needs of the object and due to the presence of higher priority cases.
* * *
**SCP-6927-A:** (apprehensive) I know you’re not the Oneiroi. What happened with them?
**Dr. Nordstrom:** We are under new management. Reacquainting ourselves with our clients is a big part of what this is.
**SCP-6927-A:** What would you like to know? Are there any forms I could fill out? (smiles) I’m actually pretty good at that.
**Dr. Nordstrom:** (lays papers on the table) You can go through these when you’re ready, for now just relax, and let’s discuss your current status. Would you generally say you are doing well?
**SCP-6927-A:** Yes, well enough. I must admit I thought they were crazy when they said I could die without dying - and even see Camilla again.
**Dr. Nordstrom:** Again?
**SCP-6927-A:** (rests head in hands) It was a car accident. She had donated her body to the Clinic and they said they could use it to help me.
**Dr. Nordstrom:** Those membranes with cerebral tissue in your abdomen?
**SCP-6927-A:** They were part of her yes, but from what they tell me they are more like anchors. She responds to them, but doesn’t really exist anymore, not in that way.
**Dr. Nordstrom:** Do you require anti-rejection meds for those?
**SCP-6927-A:** I received a gene-edit that incorporates the changes into my immune system. So far so good. Should I be worried?
**Dr. Nordstrom:** A constant monitor of your health is in effect, but feel free to call us if something seems wrong.
**SCP-6927-A:** (apprehensive) What’s this going to run me?
**Dr. Nordstrom:** You are entirely covered by your employers, a plan for your retirement is already pending, you will be given all the details on it. I can generally summarize that no further action on your part is required.
**SCP-6927-A:** (apprehensive) Generally?
**Dr. Nordstrom:** I am frequently told to avoid the use of certainties in my speech, especially during interviews. There are people I deal with who may become hostile if they feel they are being misled.
**SCP-6927-A:** Am I one of these people?
**Dr. Nordstrom:** No, and neither is Camilla.
**SCP-6927-A:** (sits up straighter) Has she talked to you? What’s she like?
**Dr. Nordstrom:** It seems the two of you should be well acquainted seeing the extent to which you are physically and metaphysically linked.
**SCP-6927-A:** We kind of occupy different parts of the day. Sometimes I get notes, reminders to take care of myself, but reading too much of her writing can cause us to trade places. Not that it’s bad for that to happen, but it prevents us from having really long written conversations. Audio, unfortunately, does the same thing. We still contact each other a lot, but it’s slow going.
**Dr. Nordstrom:** How much would you say your relationship has changed since the reconnection?
**SCP-6927-A:** At first she was shy about not recalling my name but she found it eventually, and she cares so much it can almost be annoying. When I go out, I have to use buses or walk. It’s why I had to move to ███████, neither of us were ever any good at driving and now I always black out before I can get behind a wheel.
**Dr. Nordstrom:** She used the phrase “Take the wheel.” in an earlier interview, when we asked if we could speak to you.
**SCP-6927-A:** The wheel isn’t good. Camilla believed you were only in charge when you got to touch grass. Not that I’d say she was grounded, before the accident she’d been involved a lot with the Clinic. The stuff they did there (shudders) wasn’t what I’d call down-to-earth.
**Dr. Nordstrom:** She doesn’t seem to recall exactly what happened there.
**SCP-6927-A:** Dying can really mess with your memories, that’s what they told me and it makes a lot of sense, but then, I’m also under the impression those Oneiroi guys did a lot of stuff with memory, copied or traded each other’s dreams and experiences. It’s possible she had willingly given some things up, but I don’t know how any of that would work.
**Dr. Nordstrom:** Is there anything else about the Oneiroi you can share with us?
**SCP-6927-A:** I’m pretty sure it’s not a cult, if that’s what you mean. I used to fear it was something like that but Camilla’s friends always kept their distance, explaining that the things they did “weren’t for everyone” in the most non-judgmental way. They became very supportive when I lost her, calling me “Void Dweller.” It seemed like more of a descriptor than any kind of insult.
They - terrified me - but were always waiting in the background to assist me with any problems I had. Eventually, I was willing to try anything to feel better so I let them do their thing to me and didn’t ask too many further questions.
**Dr. Nordstrom:** Did they charge you for these services?
**SCP-6927-A:** No, but sometimes they said they needed money. Not that I pay for anything, just that they needed money. I never really had it but, they’d tell me how to get it, and it was never very hard. Maybe this was them finding a way to charge me covertly? They would have known I’ve always had a phobia of debt.
**Dr. Nordstrom:** Anything else you might want us to know about Camilla, who she was, what she is now, weather there’s anything that might make the two of you more comfortable?
**SCP-6927-A:** She’d always forget peoples’ names, never mine until she came back, but other people’s, faces too. She functioned alright despite this, and it never bothered her, but she’d say it gave her problems in school and I’d noticed over the years how it made her a little paranoid. She’d remember your hobbies though, your pet, your interests, your favorite food …
I get these hints of her around the house, things I must have done when she’s in control. She leaves notes for me, one or two sentences, lists for the store etc. I recall the things she used to buy and some times I try add them but this makes my lists disappear, (laughs) so I hide them.
When I do manage to sneak gifts into the house she’s more accepting though, a knick-knack makes it’s way to a certain shelf, a bite of pickle or pomegranate right before I wake so I taste it, a shower before sunrise with her old shampoo. It was cheap stuff but she really loved the smell. I wasn’t sure about it but - I wake up with my hair smelling like grass and it’s so funny. She’ll write something like “you deserved that” on the mirror in the bathroom.
(object is blushing) - Sorry. (leaves the room)
**Dr. Nordstrom:** (2 minute pause)
**Videographer:** Are we done filming?
**Dr. Nordstrom:** Give him a moment.
**SCP-6927-A:** (returns mumbling apologies) She tried to take over just now. I guess because I got nervous revealing too much of our personal stuff to a stranger. She can feel certain things just enough to wake up and try to protect me from whatever they are.
I just got carried away. Normally I have to keep all this a secret. There are people who might mess with us if they knew. You’re not one of those people -
**Dr. Nordstrom:** (interrupts) You haven’t touched your tea, and it still appears to be warm. Before we began, you said you’d never tried this flavor.
**SCP-6927-A:** Okay. (sips tea)
**Dr. Nordstrom:** Does not being able to quite reach each other ever trouble either of you?
**SCP-6927-A:** Sometimes during day, but at night - It’s - It’s enough.
  

#### Addendum 3 - Inquiry Into Possible Agent Status for SCP-6927-B
The ability of SCP-6927-B to question low level witnesses and persons of Interest unaffiliated with the Oneiroi in a covert manner has encouraged inquiry into their implementation as an agent.
(Use of aforementioned anti-meme may be required if retention of following is difficult.)
[\+ Open Interview ](javascript:;)
[Access Granted ](javascript:;)
**Date:** February 21, 1900 HOURS (7:00 PM) 2021  
**Location:** SCP-6927-A’s residence.  
**Videographer:** Mark Kegans  
**Interviewer:** Site Psychologist Dr. Alva Nordstrom  
**Interviewed:** SCP-6927-B
**Description:** SCP-6927-A “went to bed” early and SCP-6927-B was initiated. A-Object had been granted a vacation day and had spent it repotting their succulent plants in preparation for the spring growing season.
* * *
**Dr. Nordstrom:** I was told not to say anything discouraging other than that you are allowed to say no to this without fear of reprisal.
**SCP-6927-B:** I take it I’m being recruited?
**Dr. Nordstrom:** Seeing as you are able to question targets without them remembering it, as well as produce forms and questionnaires that are quickly forgotten by the target as soon as their filled out - yes.
**SCP-6927-B:** It won’t affect the Oneiroi.
**Dr. Nordstrom:** You will not be expected to work with, or target the Oneiroi.
**SCP-6927-B:** Will this endanger Troian?
**Dr. Nordstrom:** If you only choose to supply us with forms and interview those in temporary containment? Unlikely.
**SCP-6927-B:** And the time involved?
**Dr. Nordstrom:** Ah yes, the time. You seem eager to give Troian a life despite believing that “life” isn’t good for him.
**SCP-6927-B:** The peace I found when it happened - would it kill people to just _live_ that way? Just biding one’s time isn’t fucking unwholesome! Not everyone’s a fucking Starchitect!
**Dr. Nordstrom:** (2 minute pause) Would it help if the two of you worked less?
**SCP-6927-B:** Troian works as much as I’ll allow him already. I understand the need for funds, it being a primary condemning factor of existence, but for Troian it’s an addiction fueled by the assumption that work is healthy no matter the quantity.
**Dr. Nordstrom:** Are you under the impression his managers are cruel?
**SCP-6927-B:** They don’t have to be cruel, only lack the incentive to correct what is for them advantageous. Troian is not lazy, he was never lazy, but his father never tired of that accusation and Troian never forgot, no matter how much he needed to. One guilt trip, and he’ll keep bringing it up and stewing. Part of the reason we got together was that I could get him to stop caring for awhile, I could switch him off, make him forget.
**Dr. Nordstrom:** If this next question offends you or is too personal, don’t answer it, you can remain silent, and we can move on. What I’m curious about is, what you saw in Troian.
**SCP-6927-B:** (laughs) A fine thing to ask someone who no longer has a definable mind! Part of what made me special, at least for the purposes of negation, was that I could function without out too much memory, perhaps due to my affiliation with the Oneiroi or the extent of my exposure to the collective. I mostly just use Troian’s long term memory, (that’s how I speak by the way) though his short term escapes me. From there, I can know what he saw in me. I can however, tell you what I see in him now.
**Dr. Nordstrom:** And what might that be?
**SCP-6927-B:** I see not only a person who is brave enough to seek the void but a person who eagerly shares it - with me! At night I can feel him - just completely let go. Like a fish that knows it can breath the water.
**Dr. Nordstrom:** (50 second pause) So he didn’t have to die?
**SCP-6927-B:** (whispers) He can experience death many times and be nourished by it. Protected, from those who fear the dark.
**Dr. Nordstrom:** Do you feel that not attaining the void is bad?
**SCP-6927-B:** The void has a lot of advantages, among these the fact that one can not coerce, or condemn a nonexistent thing, but there are other paths, taken by those who despise as useless that which is unobtainable, un-extractable, unreachable and un-monetizable.
**Dr. Nordstrom:** Monetizable?
**SCP-6927-B:** In the general sense. Ascendants and “Achievers” often prey on people like Troian though they deserve only those as lazy, selfish or naive as themselves and will have a time controlling them.
**Dr. Nordstrom:** And what would you call the Oneiroi?
**SCP-6927-B:** Animals, but it’s not an insult.
**Dr. Nordstrom:** You worked for them?
**SCP-6927-B:** The things they taught me made life endurable and allowed me to help Troian but that knowledge is gone, could be it served its purpose.
**Dr. Nordstrom:** Perhaps there’s something the Foundation could teach you.
**SCP-6927-B:** And what would you call the Foundation?
**Dr. Nordstrom:** Mixed Nuts.
**SCP-6927-B:** (2 minute pause)
**Dr. Nordstrom:** (laughs) What if you see how Troian feels and get back to us.
**SCP-6927-B:** (Shakes hands with Dr. Nordstrom.) It will take time.
**Dr. Nordstrom:** You could probably wait a year or two before they pop this question again, there’s always a lot of other stuff going on.
**SCP-6927-B:** Could Troian and I travel?
**Dr. Nordstrom:** Not only could you travel we have a lot of unused miles and empty safe houses. Troian’s an introvert and you - are forgettable.
(A 12 minute interval passes as interview is concluded.)
**Videographer:** Uh, could I ask a question?
**Dr. Nordstrom:** If Camilla allows it.
**SCP-6927-B:** Sure.
**Videographer:** Am I a Void Dweller?
**SCP-6927-B:** Not currently.
**Videographer:** Does that make me an Achiever or an Ascendent?
**SCP-6927-B:** Achievers are Ascendants I don’t like, I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt and call you an Ascendant.
**Videographer:** Is that bad?
**SCP-6927-B:** Just don’t be an asshole like the others.
  

**Conclusion:** Photocopies of documents drafted by SCP-6927-B were found to be un-retainable by civilian witnesses. Questionnaires can be used to gather information covertly and minimize the need for amnestic treatments. SCP-6927-B has a 60% compliance rate with questionnaire drafts, but only a 20% compliance rate with in-person interviews. Separate permissions must be obtained from B-Object for each deployment.
**Updates:** A-Object and B-Object were given “tasks” while traveling. Tasks were covert experiments meant to test the Objects’ capabilities in the field. Tasks included the transportation of parcels and the photography of randomly chosen “sites.” Rewards such as gift cards, transportation privileges and small quantities of local currency were offered as incentive with the cover that tasks were “favors” for A-Object’s employers.
The incorporation of A-Object into photography tasks was facilitated by Mark Kegans, a distant relative of A-Object through adoption. A-Object is suspected but not proven to have a similar amnestic “cloak” to B-Object albeit with far less observable effect. A-Object requires a chauffeur however some accompaniment was deemed necessary due to the Object’s established value.
