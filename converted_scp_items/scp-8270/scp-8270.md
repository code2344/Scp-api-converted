**Item #:** SCP-8270
**Object Class:** Euclid
**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-8270 is to be contained in transparent containers in a sterile forensic research lab at Site-██. Personnel must decontaminate their hands before and after handling SCP-8270. SCP-8270 should only be handled with latex or nitrile gloves. If any instances of SCP-8270 are found, personnel are to report to the on-site HMCL supervisor.
**Description:** SCP-8270 is a collection of 157 human teeth. The teeth have so far been discovered in unusual locations in and around Site-██. None have sustained any damage from the locations they were found in.
New teeth are discovered approximately 1-3 times per week. Forensic analysis is in progress — results can be found below.
**Forensic Results:**
Tooth # | Location | Description | Notes  
---|---|---|---  
001 | Inside a vending machine’s coin return tray. | Small incisor. Minor discoloration near the gum. | Likely caused by excessive coffee or tea consumption.  
008 | Ejected from a paper shredder. | Molar. Slight wear along the biting surface. | Tooth may have been subjected to higher-than-normal pressure.  
021 | Floating in a mug of coffee. | Bicuspid. Erosion near base. Mild crack on left side. Stains near crack. | Crack is likely the result of external trauma. Stains are probably from dark liquids (e.g., wine).  
038 | Trapped in the center of a numeric keypad button. | Small wisdom tooth. Faint marks near roots. | Marks near the roots could be signs of trauma, possibly from an infection.  
041 | Discovered inside SCP-███'s containment cell. | Bicuspid. Signs of having been extracted under abnormal circumstances. Surrounding tissue is absent. | Lack of surrounding tissue suggests sourcing from a cadaver.  
058 | Inside a soil sample from the greenhouse. | Large front incisor, filed down in front. Discoloration present near filing. | Filing seems to be intentional and post-mortem. Discoloration appears to not be from food.  
074 | Lodged within an air duct. | Molar. Significant damage around the edge. Likely sustained a forceful impact. | Impact likely caused the tooth to be dislodged.  
083 | Enbedded in wall insulation. | Bicuspid. Radial fractures present. Coating of dried blood along the edges. | Fractures and blood suggest direct blunt-force trauma.  
114 | Inside the intercom. | Upper molar. Stained with dirt and blood. Root is partially exposed. | Appears to have been violently extracted.  
125 | Suspended within the zero-gravity unit. | Molar. Significant chipping along the edges. | Damage suggests a violent and prolonged struggle, possibly involving restraints or forceful restraint during the time of injury.  
130 | Within a human cadaver's stomach. | Small canine. Traces of dirt are present. | Analysis of the soil reveals that the tooth was sourced from Fairvale, WV, a town near Site-██.  
142 | Suspended in a beaker of anomalous gel. | Half of an incisor. Appears to be snapped in half by blunt force. | Damage was likely the result of a forceful extraction.  
146 | Embedded within a meal from the site canteen. | Incisor. Series of unusual marks, including faint burn scars, signs of blood under the enamel, and a visible fracture. | Analysis of blood suggests the tooth was also sourced from Fairvale, and dates back to the 1980s.  
150 | Stitched into a researcher's skin. | Large molar. Roots fractured as though forcibly extracted. Base is stained red. | Evidence suggests the tooth was recovered from a site linked to the disappearances of 14 individuals in Fairvale.  
157 | Growing out of a D-Class's eye. | Molar. Charred along the crown, root missing. Engraved with the initials "R.S." | Engraving appears to have been done post-mortem, using a precision dental drill. Similar soil signature to instances #041 and #130. Forensic analysis matches missing persons records from 1984 — identified as R████ S████, age 12, a resident of Fairvale, WV.  
The reasons for the manifestations of SCP-8270 remain unclear.
