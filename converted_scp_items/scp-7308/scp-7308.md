Artist's Rendition of SCP-7308
**Item #:** SCP-7308
**Object Class:** Safe
**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7308 is contained within a standard humanoid containment cell in Site-309.
**Description:** SCP-7308 appears to be a red sphere approximately two meters in diameter. All attempts to perceive the true appearance of SCP-7308 have been unsuccessful.
  
  
  
**Addendum:**
### Discovery
SCP-7308 was discovered in Poplar Grove, Illinois after reports of an "orb" wandering a local apple orchard. Following the capture of SCP-7308, Gate B of Site-309 was blasted down by Soupglop, a known reality bender residing in Three Portlands, demanding that SCP-7308 be returned to her.
After fourteen hours of standard de-escalation procedures, Dr. Noah Addams managed to conduct an interview with Soupglop.
**< Begin Log>**
**Dr. Addams:** Are you ready to cooperate? Or am I going to have to call in the tranq unit again?
**Soupglop:** Fine. _Fine._ But mark my words, young man, I'm gonna be casting _sooooo_ many hexes on you later. I'm gonna…
_Soupglop gestures her hands in the air wildly._
**Soupglop:** And you're gonna be _SORRY_.
**Dr. Addams:** I… Okay. Well, to start, what _is_ SCP-7308?
**Soupglop:** Ha! What is it? It's my INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, that's what it is.
**Dr. Addams:** To be clear, I'm talking about the… red circle thing.
**Soupglop:** Wait, _circle?_ I thought I upgraded to the _orb_ package! Goddammit. I'm so fucking mad. I suck at contracts. Always using so much _LANGUAGE_. I—
**Dr. Addams:** No— it's— you did fine. It's an orb. I just misspoke. Sorry.
**Soupglop:** Huh. How the fuck did you go from orb to circle? There's a whole DIMENSION of difference. I thought you people were supposed to be smart!
**Dr. Addams:** I just misspoke. I'd appreciate moving on now.
**Soupglop:** Peh. Fine.
**Dr. Addams:** So, again. What is SCP-7308, and why can we only perceive it as an orb?
**Soupglop:** You see him like that because you hold _no_ shares! Nobody does! Because all the shares are _mine._ I copyrighted him!
**Dr. Addams:** Well… then what do _you_ see it as?
**Soupglop:** He's a large man with white fur. He has big muscles. He would be my husband but he's kind of stupid, so I copyrighted him instead. I call him "Yeti" and he's one of a kind. That's why Lord Alrights allowed me to finalize the ritual.
**Dr. Addams:** Hm. One moment, please.
_Dr. Addams stands, retrieves a manilla folder, then pushes it towards Soupglop. She begins inspecting its contents._
**Dr. Addams:** Did you know that [there](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeti) [are](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6453) [countless](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-1529) [entities](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-1000) that are almost identical to your "Yeti"? Therefore…
**Soupglop:** Oh… oh no.
_A tear in reality suddenly forms above Soupglop. An eye emerges, staring directly at her._
**UNKNOWN:** SOUPGLOP. YOU HAVE _LIED_ , AND BETRAYED LORD ALRIGHTS. FOR THIS YOU WILL BE PUNISHED.
**Soupglop:** Wait, wait, I didn't know! I didn't—
**UNKNOWN:** IGNORANCE IS _NOT_ FORGIVEN. PERISH.
_Soupglop disintegrates into a pile of salt, and the tear closes._
**< End Log>**
Following the interview, it was discovered that SCP-7308 had disintegrated into a pile of ground black pepper. Reclassification to Neutralized pending.
