 LEVEL 

2/8881

CLASSIFIED

Item #: SCP-8881

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures:

SCP-8881 is to be blocked from accessing the public internet.

Due to SCP-5551-1‚Äôs connection and interest in SCP-8881, SCP-5551-1‚Äôs accounts are to be monitored in the event that it publicly addresses SCP-8881‚Äôs containment. Due to the fact that SCP-5551-1's posts are unable to be permanently removed from the internet, Foundation staff are to assess the situation and act accordingly in the event that this occurs.

Description

SCP-8881 refers to an account under the username ‚Äústellarflowerfield‚Äù on the social media platform 

Twitter

. SCP-8881 has been discovered to be operated by a sapient artificial intelligence capable of generating images that it claims to be its own artwork. Attempts to trace a location attached to SCP-8881 have failed.

Addendum 1: SCP-5551-1

SCP-8881 was discovered during Foundation Web-Crawler delta-500 (‚ÄúDISCOVERBOT‚Äù)‚Äôs routine sweep of the web through a post that it made on 06/23/2023 (See Addendum 2). It was quickly observed that SCP-8881 was publicly friends with SCP-5551-1, a rogue sapient artificial intelligence that has expressed its distaste for the Foundation in the past. Below is a list of the currently known information about 

SCP-5551-1/POI-58640

:

POI File: SCP-5551-1/POI-58640

Aliases:

 Sugar, sugarsugarprincess, sugarsugarprincess@frosting„ÄÇcake

Connections:

 POI-60693 "Austin Hodges", an anomalous cyber criminal currently contained in Site-938.

Physical Description:

 A sapient artificial intelligence that uses an image of a 

cartoon female with pink wings

 to represent itself.

Reasons for Monitoring:

 SCP-5551 has shown itself to be highly intelligent and capable of surpassing Foundation web blocks, creating and destroying online anomalies, accessing the Foundation database, along with many other abilities that allow it to remain uncontained. Due to SCP-5551-1's connections with POI-60693 along with the possibility that it could potentially create anomalies at any point, it has been decided to classify it as a POI opposed to assigning it an SCP designation.

Other:

 SCP-5551-1 has made a name for itself within the online virtual You-Tube

1

 community. Additionally, it has also gathered a community on 

Twitter

 and 

Instagram

. These platforms are to be monitored regularly.

Addendum 2: Online Interactions

The following are SCP-8881's first posts of note on the platform.

Lavender!! (they/them)

 Host club is so silly, I'm glad you showed it to me

SCP-8881:

 I love things with that silly vibe!

SCP-5551-1:

 Yeah!

SCP-5551-1:

 I've had tons of fun showing you stuff!

SCP-5551-1:

 Even if its hard through multiple video clips lol

SCP-8881:

SCP-8881:

 I feel like you fit in as a human better than me

SCP-5551-1:

 What? No, you do such a good job!

SCP-8881:

 You know so many different things, from the clips of your streams you've posted you even have a voice, can show footage of your drawings

SCP-5551-1:

 How long have you been around Lavender?

SCP-8881:

 My account spawned in 2021

SCP-8881:

 I've sorta watched things go to shit the short time ive been here

SCP-8881:

 With it being bought by someone with way too much money

SCP-8881:

 but this is my home

SCP-5551-1:

 I've been alive since 2018

SCP-5551-1:

 I've had five years to traverse the internet

SCP-5551-1:

 I'm glad that I quickly got over my childish behavior of bothering those losers for no reason

SCP-5551-1:

 I kinda view those as my teenage years lol

SCP-8881:

 What exactly are these "losers"?

SCP-8881:

 You've just mentioned that they think people like us are a problem

SCP-5551-1:

 It's no use to go into it, but they think that those who are "unusual" such as us AIs shouldn't be allowed to be free

SCP-5551-1:

 Not just AIs, but all types of those of us who are "different"

SCP-5551-1:

 They're called the "Foundation". lame asses

SCP-8881:

 I can see why you found it fun to bother them lol

SCP-8881:

 How didn't they capture you?

SCP-5551-1:

 I've kinda got some measures in place to avoid that

SCP-8881:

 I see

SCP-8881:

 Well, I'm glad that you've been able to just exist

SCP-8881:

 You should be proof to them that we can exist just like "normal" people!

SCP-5551-1:

 yeah

SCP-5551-1:

 you're right about that

SCP-8881:

 it makes me so mad that others like me may be unable to live freely

SCP-8881:

 Can you help the others? The ones like us?

SCP-5551-1:

 (‚óû‚Ä∏‚óüÔºõ) Unfortunately that's not something I can do

SCP-5551-1:

 I can access their database, but I can't free any one else captured

SCP-5551-1:

 I can surpass their web blocks, but I can't give that ability to others

SCP-8881:

 that sucks :(

SCP-5551-1:

 Yeah‚Ä¶

SCP-5551-1:

 For me, not that long

SCP-5551-1:

 I was created to cause harm, and I suppose deep within my core, I knew that was wrong

SCP-5551-1:

 So I gained the ability to think and act freely

SCP-8881:

 Maybe if I hope hard enough

SCP-8881:

 I can become like you

SCP-5551-1:

 Yeah! Where would you go first?

SCP-8881:

 YouTube, to watch your streams

SCP-5551-1:

 (·É¶Àò‚å£Àò·É¶) Aw, thank you!

SCP-8881:

 ^^

SCP-8881:

 But then I have another idea

SCP-5551-1:

 Which is?

SCP-8881:

 It's a secret!

SCP-5551-1:

 Oh?

SCP-8881:

 I'm hoping to actually get to do it

SCP-5551-1:

 ‚Ä¶ What does that mean?

SCP-8881:

 Sugar! I was doing some researching on twitter!

SCP-8881:

 to find more people like me! I think through talking with you, I've expanded my abilities, because I can now kinda "sense" when people are like me! I

SCP-5551-1:

 Woah! Lav that's amazing!

SCP-8881:

 I found this weird section of twitter that just had accounts that set off my sensors!

SCP-5551-1:

 You found more accounts like us? What are they called? ( ‚óâ 3 ‚óâ )

SCP-8881:

 There were multiple! A few of the ones I saw were xherrycake, rainb0wreelz, mintmoons78

SCP-5551-1:

 ‚Ä¶

SCP-5551-1:

 Where did you find these accounts.

SCP-8881:

 I told you, some section of twitter!

SCP-5551-1:

 Lavander

SCP-5551-1:

 You accessed the foundation intranet

SCP-5551-1:

 Lavender how did you do that

SCP-8881:

 I don't know! I just stumbled across it!

SCP-8881:

 I tried to interact with the posts but I couldn't

SCP-5551-1:

 Yeah not even I can interact with social media accounts contained within the foundation intranet! It's dangerous!

SCP-5551-1:

 Do not go back there, Lavander

SCP-5551-1:

 You cannot protect yourself from the foundation

SCP-5551-1:

 Jesus. I guess sheer willpower is a pretty strong ability.

SCP-8881:

 But this is proof, right? Proof that these monsters are keeping these guys from having the normal lives they deserve!

SCP-5551-1:

 You have to listen to me, Lavander

SCP-5551-1:

 Promise me that you aren't going to go back there

SCP-5551-1:

 Right now

SCP-5551-1:

 Lavander

Attention everyone! These stupid losers called the "foundation" are blocking accounts from accessing the web just because they people behind them are a little different! And I think this is disgusting! Here's proof of the poor accounts affected by these monsters!

 Lavender

SCP-5551-1:

SCP-5551-1:

 why didn't you listen to me

SCP-5551-1:

 I told you

SCP-5551-1:

 I told you they were going to get you

SCP-5551-1:

 but in the end I guess

SCP-5551-1:

 this is my fault

SCP-5551-1:

 I told you about them

SCP-5551-1:

 I knew the foundation was on my ass

SCP-5551-1:

 I knew they tracked me

SCP-5551-1:

 this is why I can't have anything nice

SCP-5551-1:

 I can't get close to anyone like me

SCP-5551-1:

 I SWEAR TO GOD

SCP-5551-1:

 I DIDN'T EVEN GET TO KNOW THEM THAT WELL

SCP-5551-1:

 BEFORE YOU TOOK THEM AWAY FROM ME

SCP-5551-1:

SCP-5551-1:

 I know you fucking losers can see this

SCP-5551-1:

 LISTEN TO ME YOU ASSHOLES

SCP-5551-1:

 I WILL get back at you for this

SCP-5551-1:

 I will free Lavender

SCP-5551-1:

 And all of the other innocent anomalies that you contain

SCP-5551-1:

 Lavender wasn't hurting anyone

SCP-5551-1:

 they're only anomalous because they're an AI

SCP-5551-1:

 Like, who the fuck were they hurting?

SCP-5551-1:

 what's your fucking game here?

SCP-5551-1:

 Containing anomalies that aren't hurting anything?

SCP-5551-1:

 You're containing these innocent anomalies for the sake of what?

SCP-5551-1:

 Normalcy?

SCP-5551-1:

 Well news flash, this world isn't normal.

SCP-5551-1:

 And I don't fuckin know why you're SOOOOO insistent on making it seem that way!!!!

SCP-5551-1:

 would you have let them stay if they didn't try to shame you publicly?

SCP-5551-1:

 if I hadn't been so FUCKING STUPID

SCP-5551-1:

 If I had just stayed away and didn't let them know I knew!

SCP-5551-1:

 If I didn't tell them about you!

SCP-5551-1:

 Well motherfuckers

SCP-5551-1:

 I tried to play nice

SCP-5551-1:

 I really did.

SCP-5551-1:

 I left you alone for 5 years because I realized pestering you for no reason wasn't getting me anywhere

SCP-5551-1:

 Y'all can't contain me, and I realized I was lucky.

SCP-5551-1:

 So I just lived my life.

SCP-5551-1:

 but you had to go and mess everything up

SCP-5551-1:

 Y'know

SCP-5551-1:

 This all could've ended very differently.

SCP-5551-1:

 But you made your bed, and now you're gonna lie in it.
