Special Containment Procedures:

 The entrance to SCP-7519-1 has been sealed. No contact between SCP-7519-1 and Foundation personnel is to be allowed, regardless of clearance. Personnel are forbidden from coming within less than 10 meters of SCP-7519-1. The contents of SCP-7519-1 are not to be observed. Personnel attempting to observe the contents of SCP-7519-1 are not to be reprimanded, as the punishment of violating this procedure is the action itself.

Any sounds coming from the interior of SCP-7519-1 are to be ignored. Any rabbits trapped inside are to be left unattended to avoid risking exposure to SCP-7519-1's contents.

No rabbits are to be recruited by the Foundation. Any rabbits found to have been working for the Foundation are to be terminated.

Description:

 SCP-7519 is an anomalous phenomenon that affects pregnant women worldwide. Pregnant women affected by SCP-7519 will give birth to a specimen of 

Oryctolagus cuniculus

 (European rabbit) at the end of their gestation period. SCP-7519 cannot be predicted prior to birth, ultrasound images of fetuses carried by women affected by SCP-7519 do not show any abnormalities. SCP-7519's effects will become apparent only after birth, during which a single specimen of 

Oryctolagus cuniculus

 will come to term. Rabbits that are born from SCP-7519-affected women are superficially non-anomalous, however, these rabbits appear to age at a much slower rate compared to their regular counterparts.

In rare cases, a woman affected by SCP-7519 will give birth to a variable number of non-anomalous human infants (ranging from one to three) along with an instance of 

Oryctolagus cuniculus

. The reason for this anomaly is unknown.

SCP-7519-1 is a Standard Type IV animal containment unit located within an isolated wing of Site-21. Contained within SCP-7519-1 is a single instance of 

Oryctolagus cuniculus

. It is unknown how this particular specimen came under containment, although Foundation records indicate that SCP-7519-1 was built in 1933, but not for the specific purpose of containing what it contains now.

Prior to the entrance to SCP-7519-1 being sealed, specimens of 

Oryctolagus cuniculus

 would occasionally exit the containment chamber. A background search would reveal these specimens to be rabbits which had been born to SCP-7519-affected women. In many instances, these rabbits were revealed to be Foundation employees. The practice of recruiting rabbits as Foundation employees has been forbidden to prevent any more rabbits from infringing containment protocols.

27 years old Mya Poole gave birth to a single European rabbit at 12.07 pm by local time. This rabbit (named Aidan Poole) was raised by Ms. Poole until they left home at age 18 to pursue a degree in molecular biology. Mr. Poole was recruited by the SCP Foundation in 2022 as Junior Researcher, was presumably exposed to the contents of SCP-7519-1 in 2023 and executed per standard protocol immediately upon exiting the chamber.

31 years old Alma Roth gave birth to a single European rabbit along with a regular human infant at 1.30 am by local time. This rabbit (named Aaron Roth) was raised by Ms. Roth until they were arrested for drug abuse at the age of 17 and subsequently sentenced to 14 years in prison. Mr. Roth was recruited by the Foundation as D Class personnel in 2020, was presumably exposed to the contents of SCP-7519-1 in 2022 and executed per standard protocol immediately upon exiting the chamber.

05/06/2001

21 years old Gabriella Babes gave birth to a single European rabbit at 5.45 pm by local time. This rabbit (named Toma Babes) was raised by Ms. Babes until their arrest for armed robbery at the age of 18 and subsequent sentencing to 20 years in prison. Mr. Babes was recruited by the Foundation as D Class personnel in 2021, was presumably exposed to the contents of SCP-7519-1 in 2022 and executed per standard protocol immediately upon exiting the chamber.

24 years old Kora Ratliff gave birth to a single European rabbit at 2.03 am by local time. This rabbit (named Andrew Ratliff) was raised by Ms. Ratliff until they left home at the age of 18 to pursue a degree in business and administration. Mr. Ratliff was recruited by the Foundation in 1995 as Junior Researcher, and became Director of Site-21 in 2012. It is unknown when Dir. Ratliff was exposed to the contents of SCP-7519-1. Their current status is unknown, as they went missing in 2018 and haven't been seen since.

This rabbit (named Evie Jones) was raised as an orphan because of their mother's early death due to childbirth complications. At age 18, they joined the police force, rising to the rank of Sergeant by the age of 31. Ms. Jones was recruited by the Foundation in 2001 as an undercover operative. Agent Jones was exposed to the contents of SCP-7519-1 in 2019 during a containment breach at Site-21 and executed per standard protocol immediately upon exiting the chamber. Prior to their termination, Agent Jones had 18 years of excellent service to the Foundation as an espionage expert despite being a rabbit.

Mr. Spencer would complete their PhD in evolutionary biology in 2022, attaining the title of a Foundation Doctor. In 2023, Dr. Spencer ignored standard protocol and made unauthorized entry into SCP-7519-1. Dr. Spencer was executed immediately upon exiting the chamber. A video camera was recovered from their person.

Transcript Of An Interaction Which Took Place Between Dr. Connor Spencer And A Rabbit On ██/██/2023

Dr. Spencer enters SCP-7519-1. Contained within a cage within the chamber is a single European rabbit who carefully observes Spencer's every move.

The Rabbit:

 It's a pleasure to welcome you to my humble home, sir.

Dr. Spencer:

 

(clucking sounds)

The Rabbit:

 It appears I can, sir.

Dr. Spencer:

 

(hissing sounds)

The Rabbit:

 I'm here because you put me here. I must ask why 

you

 are here, sir. I believe your presence is not authorized.

Dr. Spencer:

 

(growling sounds)

The Rabbit:

 Now now. Do you think 

that

 to be appropriate language, sir?

Dr. Spencer:

 

(sounds of teeth grinding)

The Rabbit:

 I believe you're a bit misguided sir.

Dr. Spencer:

 

(sounds of snorting)

The Rabbit:

 I must admit recruiting rabbits is a rather… unorthodox hiring practice for such a prestigious organization, sir. But what does your employers' poor hiring ethic have anything to do with yours truly?

Dr. Spencer:

 

(sounds of angry foot stomping)

The Rabbit:

 Sorry to interrupt you sir, but don't you think this is highly hypocritical of you?

Dr. Spencer:

 

(humming sounds)

The Rabbit:

 After all, you yourself happen to be a rabbit.

Dr. Spencer:

 

(sounds of whimpering in disagreement)

The Rabbit:

 I'm sorry to differ with you sir. But 

you

 are a rabbit. You've 

always

 been a rabbit. I should know sir. I've 

always

 been here.

Dr. Spencer does not respond. Dr. Spencer is a rabbit.

The Rabbit:

 That's strange isn't it, sir? The fact that you have no recollection of that at all.

Dr. Spencer does not respond. Dr. Spencer has always been a rabbit.

The Rabbit:

 Oh, but you 

will

, sir. You feel it now, don't you?

Dr. Spencer attempts to respond, but all that comes out is a clucking sound.

Dr. Spencer is a rabbit.

Dr. Spencer looks down at their hands. They are soft and covered with fur, much like a rabbit's paws.

This is because Dr. Spencer is a rabbit.

Dr. Spencer panicks.

Dr. Spencer exits SCP-7519-1 in a distressed state.

The Rabbit smiles widely.

Dr. Spencer is a rabbit.

Dr. Spencer has always been a rabbit.

<END LOG>

Update:

 In light of the events of this interaction, the entrance to SCP-7519-1 has been sealed and containment procedures have been revised accordingly per executive order to prevent further occurrences of SCP-7519.

These revised containment procedures have been effective so far, seeing that no rabbits have been employed by the Foundation ever since.
