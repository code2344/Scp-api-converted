 stillnesses and he is making it worse. I walked down the road petrified. At first, I thought I was alone; but as I walked, I could feel him; closer.

I did make it home; but as soon as I got on my uncomfortable bed, I could see him. He was in front of my bed; watching. I did manage to sleep, but I could always feel him stalking me. Although I knew he was only there to give me a good scare, this has traumatized me. This was an incident that I could never forget. It was him; De Ogen

"One night, a… a man was just driving to his grandma. But as he was driving, he was met by… mesmerizing fog. He thought it was a vibe but then-"

"I'm sorry. What exactly is this story you're telling? You didn't even give a title."

"Right. This story is titled The 

De Ogen

? Isn't the De Ogen a monster in that game?"

"Yo, shut up. I'm trying my best. So, as the man was driving, he was greeted by fog. There was no one on the road. He thought it was a vibe until he had the feeling that something or someone was watching him."

he eats his marshmallow on a stick

"And then, he ignored this feeling. But as he drove even more, a shadow figure greeted him. This scared him and caused him to crash the car into a tree. He ran deep into the woods until he saw a cabin. You likin' where this is going?"

pause

"No! It doesn't make any sense. So like, this De Ogen is a shadow figure that scared the dude you mentioned in the story. Now what? He is gonna go and kill him?"

"No, here's how it goes."

clears throat

"The man entered the cabin but there was no one there. luckily, the cabin had supplies necessary for living. As the fog was fading, he heard a faint child laughing. The end. Did that scare you?"

both silent

"No, not gonna lie, that didn't even scare me. What even was that story? Could've done better, y'know."
