8174

SCP-8174 under construction in 1994.

Special Containment Procedures:

 The components of SCP-8174 are to be contained within a veiled shipyard positioned three kilometres east of Guanaja, Honduras (16°27'11.216" N, 85°52'0.912" W). SCP-8174 is to be installed within the multi-purpose vessel known as 

the Ark

, no sooner than the 20th of January 1996.

1

SCP-8174 is to be integrated into the engine compartment of the Ark. Following integration, all components directly powered by SCP-8174—including mechanical systems, transformers, water purification units, piping, and electrical infrastructure—are to be included in SCP-8174 containment protocols. Non-mechanical sections of the Ark, such as the cargo hold, living quarters, containment chambers, recreational facilities, and commercial areas, are to be explicitly excluded from SCP-8174 classification.

Upon completion of SCP-8174 installation, the vessel's operation and launch are to be supervised by designated maintenance officers and the assigned Chief Marine Engineer. Containment and operational procedures specific to the Ark are to be finalized during the outfitting phase. Mobile Task Force Alpha-1 ("Red Right Hand") is assigned as the primary task force for operations aboard the Ark and will adhere to supplementary containment directives as outlined by Foundation maritime protocols.

SCP-8174 Maintenance routines are to be conducted biweekly by personnel with Level 4 clearance. Any irregular power outputs or deviations in SCP-8174's performance parameters are to be reported immediately to O5 Command. Major deviations must be reviewed by O5-1, who will determine if a shutdown of auxiliary systems is necessary.

Scenario: Gilgamesh

.

Description:

 SCP-8174 is a perpetual motion machine constructed by the Foundation. The machine is capable of generating energy for infinite propulsion and otherwise powering a major vessel. As such, it will be used as the main engine in the Ark, head vessel for the SCP Foundation following Earth's submersion.

The engine consists of a 20x60m cast-iron block fitted with machinery for marine propulsion and five levels of man-made maintenance platforms. It resembles a traditional four stroke trunk engine. However, it does not require any gas or ignition, and can produce up to 500 MW.

 This amount of power is suitable for the powering of a vessel at the magnitude of the Ark.

Addendum 8174.1: 

The Ark

:

The Ark measures approximately 400 meters in length and is constructed with reinforced hull plating to withstand extreme oceanic conditions. It represents the Foundation's primary operational hub in the aftermath of Earth's submersion. The vessel is designed as a self-sustaining habitat for surviving personnel, civilians and contained anomalies following the enactment of Scenario: Gilgamesh. The four main compartments of the Ark are outlined below.

Standardized berthing fitted for six people. Mechanical ventilation systems are controlled via SCP-8174 for humidity, carbon monoxide levels and temperature.

Living habitats, including living quarters, recreational and commercial zones.

Containment facility, for the containment of high-priority items as well as sources of resources.

Logistics compartment, for the general maintenance of SCP-8174, but also resource management within the Ark's supply chain.

Provisional compartments, designed as buffers in high-risk situations.

As long as SCP-8174's functionality allows for it, the Ark may be used as a transoceanic vessel. In the event of a total systems failure or containment breach, the Ark’s Provisional Compartments are designed to isolate compromised sections of the vessel. This process includes the complete sealing and, if necessary, controlled ejection of affected areas into the ocean. While this safeguard preserves the integrity of the Ark, it is understood that such measures may result in substantial loss of personnel and resources.

This document is annually updated with maintenance logs which report on the state of SCP-8174 but also its effects on the Ark. Currently, these logs span from 1997 to 2010.

Addendum 8174.10: Memorandum – 23rd of March, 2004

Since the succession of O5 Command, we have promised personnel involved with the maintenance of SCP-8174 improvements in management and organization. The reasons behind are the apparent lack of motivation in personnel working on containment, but also the well-being of the entire population on The Ark. Now, we are delivering those improvements.

Stay alerted for updated maintenance protocol and revision of personnel rotation routines.
