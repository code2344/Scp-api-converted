Special Containment Procedures:

 SCP-7487 is to be shut down while the investigation into Akram Fahim's personal life is ongoing. Frequent customers are currently being monitored for anomalous abilities or physical changes.

The containment procedures will be updated as the investigation progresses.

Description:

 SCP-7487 is a kebab shop known as "Fahim's Kebab Place", owned by Akram Fahim,

1

an Afghan refugee from the Hazara ethnic group who immigrated to the United States as part of the 2021 Kabul airlift. The meat sold in the establishment has been proven to have anomalously positive health effects on persons consuming it. Tests with D-class personnel struggling from incurable illnesses such as terminal cancer, rabies or prion disease have shown to briefly recover after consuming products sold in SCP-7487, with the effects of their disease typically returning after 48 hours.

Analysis of samples of the meat has confirmed it to be of mostly human origin. Research into its source is ongoing.

Investigation Log

Following the identification of the anomaly by members of the Department of Analytics, a three-member team of MTF Lambda-14 ("One-Star Reviewers") was sent to investigate the structure on 08/10/2024 during closing hours, posing as health inspectors. The transcription of the following infiltration can be viewed below.

[BEGIN LOG]

[Agents Ruby and Gold of MTF Lambda-14 approach and enter SCP-7487, while Agent Emerald remains outside of the anomaly in case of emergency. POI-7487 can be seen cleaning a blade covered in a red substance]

POI-7487:

 Sorry, sorry we are closing-

Ruby:

 Our apologies, but we're with the Food Safety and Inspection Service. We've received complains regarding the state of your establishment. May we come in?

POI-7487:

 What? No, you were here last week, you must be mistaken. Sorry, I have to-

Gold:

 Oh, really? I'll notify our superiors about that later. But for now, we just have to get a look around. It's protocol. We won't take too long.

[Agent Gold says as she shows POI-7487 a badge with the logo of the FSIS and her name. POI-7487 sighs and looks around, before taking a step back and gesturing for them to come in. He can be seen fidgeting with a hankerchief. At the same time, Agent Emerald sets up Hume and Elan-Vital Energy monitoring equipment outside]

Ruby:

 You're saying there have been no issues found before, Mr. Fahim?

[He nods as the MTF personnel search near the counter, finding no items of note. Unlike in traditional kebab restaurants, the kitchen is not visible from in front of the counter. Agent Gold approaches the kitchen door]

Gold:

 I have to say, working this job sure makes one hungry-

[Agent Gold pauses as she opens the door, revealing the kitchen. A trail of blood is seen, leading from a traditional Doner Kebab rotisserie towards a staircase leading down. Various cognitohazardous symbols are drawn on the walls using a substance presumed to be blood, designed to implant false images of a standard kitchen to persons viewing them.

Emerald:

 Humes appear to be normal, EVE's slightly above average but nothing too alarming. Anything you've got of note?

[Agent Emerald speaks into the earpiece. The agents inside don't respond as Ruby notices the state of the kitchen. Agent Gold cautiously takes a step inside]

POI-7487:

 You are okay?

[He says as he looks towards Ruby, while taking a step towards the door. The agent is able to notice it and draws his gun, which causes POI-7487 to raise his arms.]

POI-7487:

 Wha-wha-what? You're…no, please, just take the money and-

Ruby:

 Shut up and sit down!

Gold:

 What's going on there?

Ruby:

 Nothing, I got it under control. You have something?

[As he asks that, Agent Gold approaches the stairs, which lead to a room with a metal door at the end. In addition to other cognitohazardous symbols, various sigils associated with carnomancy are seen drawn on it, in addition to a spiral symbol]

Gold:

 Think so!

[END LOG]

Following the apprehension of POI-7487, the door found within SCP-7487 was subsequently breached using door charges, due to the restaurant's owner's refusal to cooperate and provide the keys to which could open it. The room behind it contained a large carnomantic in the form of an amorphous mound of flesh, with tendril-like tumors, superficialy resembling portions of Kebab meat. Samples of the construct confirmed it to be the origin of meat sold on SCP-7487.

Following this discovery, an interview took place involving POI-7487. A transcription can be seen below.

Interviewer:

 Michael Herring

Interviewee:

 POI-7487 (Akram Fahim)

Date:

 9/10/2024

[BEGIN LOG]

[POI-7487 is seen sitting at the interrogation table with his arms cuffed, his hands shaking. He briefly looks into the camera with a confused expression, before the interviewer enters the room. He is visibly startled]

Herring:

 Good evening, Mr. Fa-

POI-7487:

 What's happening? Who are you? Is this…police?

Herring:

 Oh, it's fine Mr. Fahim, calm down. Would you like some tea, or coffee, perhaps?

[Michael Herring smiles at POI-7487, before sitting down and placing a cup of coffee on the table, closer to the POI than himself]

POI-7487:

 You're…government. Yes?

Herring:

 In a way. Mr. Fahim, I'm just here to ask you a few questions, then we will let you go. Yes, you heard that right. No strings attached, just some…formalities. But that's something for later.

POI-7487:

 But what-what do you mean? Why am I here? Did I do something?

Herring:

 Yes, Mr. Fahim. You have utilized an anomalous effect as part of an above-veil buisness, a crime by both international and local law. A crime that, in most circumstances, leads to such buisness being shut down and its owner put into containment. But let's not get ahead of ourselves, shall we?

[POI-7487's hands are seen shaking even harder as he looks at Herring. He looks down and, after a few seconds of silence, speaks in a quieter tone]

POI-7487:

 What do you want from me?

Herring:

 Right. We have found these…

[Herring hands him a folder containing polaroid photos]

 interesting symbols drawn across your kitchen. We know their purpose, of course. We have come across them 

previously, as well

. Where do you know them from?

POI-7487:

 Oh…of course. From Ghuka, my village. Our elders drew it on buildings, cars, it was so that…well…

Herring:

 The outside world wouldn't encroach on you?

POI-7487:

 No, not…not at first. They said we are…healers, sufis…sheikhs! But then…first the Talibs, they called us Zindiq, Kafirs, many, many names…

Herring:

 Were they the only ones?

POI-7487:

 There was Daesh

, but they came later. But people joined them after.

Herring:

 That's…very unfortunate to hear, Mr.Fahim. I take it that made you decide to leave Afghanistan?

[POI-7487 nods his head]

Herring:

 Let's switch to a different subject. Your food was noted to have very good health effects on all who consumed it. Why was that the case?

POI-7487:

 It's how my father taught me to make it. To make people better, healthier.

Herring:

 So it wasn't a trick to get more customers?

[POI-7487 looks up at Herring with a frustrated expression]

POI-7487:

 I can care for people without wanting money for it! I just had to make it somehow. It's so…hard to make it, here in America.

Herring:

 I apologize for my assumptions. One last question, and that will be it for this interview. Where did you get the meat? The meat that you have used in your restaurant, that is. And yes, we have discovered the construct in your basement.

[POI-7487 lifts up his shirt, exposing a large scar on his belly, before touching it]

Herring:

 …I see.

[END LOG]

Afterword:

 DNA analysis confirmed the construct present in POI-7487's basement to be genetically identical to him.
