#### **Special Containment Procedures**
**File Update 22/03/1984:** To ensure personnel safety following Event 5936-1, upon entering SCP-5936, all individuals are to thaumaturgically protect themselves by saying the following phrase loudly and clearly:
`"I am me. My body is mine and mine only."`
All personnel failing to do so are to leave the entry point under the threat of immediate termination.
The area in which SCP-5936 manifests has been acquired by the Foundation with a one-kilometer exclusion zone established around it. A disinformation campaign attributing the quarantine to a radiation leak has been devised and is to be disseminated to media and news outlets in nearby communities. All individuals extremal to the Foundation that attempt to enter the area must be denied access and directed to one of the surrounding towns.
Following Event 5936-1, all action-planning regarding SCP-5936 has been moved to Site-120.

#### **Description**
[![czstclean1](https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--resized-images/scp-5936/czstclean1/medium.jpg)](https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-5936/czstclean1)
The approximate location of SCP-5936’s manifestation.
SCP-5936 is a spatial disruption occurring approximately 2 kilometers north of the town of Częstochowa, Poland; the anomaly's interior is approximately 100 km² — 78% larger than the area of 56 km² expected. Additionally, SCP-5936 can only be observed and entered by individuals that:
  * Are non-religious,
  * [Have lost a close relative or friend](/critter-profile-sparky),
  * Have worked with or been a witness of occult phenomena.

Whenever an individual is brought near the anomaly that does not meet the above criteria, they neglect its existence, claiming to only see a barren field[1](javascript:;) and expressing a desire to leave the area.
Although scans and surveys of SCP-5936 have found no lifeforms inhabiting the area naturally, subjects who enter the anomaly have reported:
  * Sensations of being watched,
  * Paranoia of the presence of someone nearby,
  * Feelings of immense, irrational hatred and sorrow.

The inside of SCP-5936 consists primarily of an urban topological district incorporating elements such as parking lots, playgrounds, shops, and a singular park. The weather within SCP-5936 will contain dense fog and clouds, despite the weather surrounding the anomaly. Additionally, once an individual has crossed the threshold into SCP-5936, they will find that the sun sits at a consistent 6° altitude; indicative of ~ 17:00 (5:00 PM) in the area.
SCP-5936-1 is a designation given to a currently unknown number of violent entities manifesting within the borders of SCP-5936. The anomalous humanoids bear the resemblance to distorted _homo sapiens_ and are heavily disconnected from local reality. For further information regarding SCP-5936-1 instances, see Addendum 5936-3.

#### **Discovery**
[![fog](https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--resized-images/scp-5936/fog/medium.jpg)](https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-5936/fog)
The park present within SCP-5936.
SCP-5936 was discovered on 21/02/1984 during Site-120's routine check of surrounding towns for potential anomalous phenomena. After five patients in local clinics were reported to have experienced hallucinations of a nonexistent district of the town, the Foundation was notified and an investigation regarding said reports was initiated. Multiple interviews with individuals supposedly affected by said hallucinations were made, and as a result, SCP-5936 was discovered shortly after.
* * *
#### **Addendum 5936-1 — Exploration Logs**
The first exploration log of SCP-5936 was recorded shortly after the anomaly was detected. Due to the personnel requirements being discovered not long following initial contact, a special Mobile Task Force, Omega-5 ("The Good Boys") meeting them was created for the purpose of SCP-5936 research. In order to gather all information regarding SCP-5936, provisional Outpost-120-1 was created near the entrance of the anomaly.

**Team Members:** Om-5-2, Om-5-3, Om-5-4, Om-5-5
**Foreword:** The exact properties of SCP-5936 were, as of then, unknown.

**[BEGIN LOG]**
**Om-5-1:** Recording's on. Check your mics and weapons.
**Om-5-2:** Check.
**Om-5-3:** Check.
**Om-5-4:** Check.
**Om-5-5:** And check makes five.
**Om-5-1:** Command, you hear us?
**Dr. Asheworth:** All clear, One.
**Om-5-1:** Alright. Keep your eyes open. We've no idea what could be in there.
**Om-5-2:** Roger.

**Om-5-3:** Holy shit, this's one foggy place.
**Om-5-2:** Central Europe and autumn don't really go well together, eh?
**Om-5-1:** Doc, you see that block over there?
**Dr. Asheworth:** Yes, what of it?
**Om-5-1:** Someone's there, watching us. I can see them from the corner of my eye.
**Dr. Asheworth:** I can make a scan of the region to see who or what that is.
**Om-5-1:** Then do.
_Two minutes pass as Dr. Asheworth performs a scan of local terrain._
**Dr. Asheworth:** No, no one's there. Are you absolutely sure you saw something?
**Om-5-1:** Yes, I am. W-wait, now they're gone. It-it doesn't make any—
**Dr. Asheworth:** Forget it. Spatial anomalies can fuck with perception, trust me.
**Om-5-4:** That's weird. I think I saw it too.
**Dr. Asheworth:** I would suggest you enter the building it was in, then.
**Om-5-1:** Well… alright. Four and Three, we enter that building. Five, Two, you stay here. Try to see if anyone's around the block.
**Om-5-5:** Alright.
_Omega-5 split up — Om-1, Om-3, and Om-4 enter one of the blocks of flats SCP-5936 consists of. The rest of the team stays near the entrance to the building._
**Om-5-4:** Damn, this place is pretty run down.
**Om-5-3:** As are most blocks in this region. Nothing special, really.
**Om-5-1:** Let's maybe save the talking for later.
**Om-5-3:** Fair enough.
**Om-5-4:** While we're here, let's maybe see what's inside those apartments.
**Om-5-1:** Good idea. _Very quietly: Don't turn your head. There is someone watching us from that corridor on Four's right. Doc, are you absolutely sure there was no one here?_
**Dr. Asheworth:** My scans show nothing. I think it might be the influence of the anomal-
**Om-5-1:** _This isn't stress, Asheworth. I know there is someone there, I can see it with my goddamn eyes, y—_
**Om-5-3:** _Chill, man._
**Om-5-1:** _No, you fu— wait a goddamn minute, what's happening here? It's— Jesus Christ, I'm sorry, doc, I have no idea what got into me, I-_
**Dr. Asheworth:** Don't worry. This could be just anomalous influence. Does anyone else see that presence?
**Om-5-1:** _It… it seems like it disappeared, again, I… I have no idea what—_
**Dr. Asheworth:** Forget it. How about you enter one of those apartments instead?
**Om-5-4:** Good idea.
_Omega-5 climb up the stairs of the building. They stop near the door to one of the apartments._
**Om-5-3:** Oi, doc, you seeing this? There's some sort of a, a… uhh… magic-ish symbol here.
**Dr. Asheworth:** Give me a moment… yeah, I see it.
**Om-5-1:** What does it mean?
**Dr. Asheworth:** Well, that's not how thaumaturgic symbols work… I'm not familiar with this one, hold on a second. Give me like three minutes, okay?
_Two minutes pass._
**Dr. Asheworth:** …you absolutely sure? Alright. Well, let's begin with the fact that this should not be here. It's beyond old. I've only seen it used twice, at best. It's an amalgamation of two signs that, when combined, literally mean "to open a gateway with a sacrifice". Without the context of the full spell, I can't tell you what that truly means. Look around for more sigils like this.

Still frame from Omega-5-1’s camera feed depicting the unidentified symbol.
**Om-5-1:** Understood.
**Om-5-3:** Wait, it's here, too.
**Om-5-4:** And here.
**Om-5-3:** Yeah, it's near every door.
**Om-5-1:** Wait, isn't this a cross near them?
**Dr. Asheworth:** That… that's weird. I've never really seen anything like that.
**Om-5-1:** I suppose that means we're gonna need to get into one of those apartments, am I right?
**Dr. Asheworth:** You indeed are.
_Omega-5 enter one of the apartments. A TV can be heard in the background._
**Om-5-3:** Doc, you _absolutely sure_ there is no one in the building?
**Dr. Asheworth:** What? Yes, why?
**Om-5-3:** There is an unfinished meal, still hot, just… just sitting there on the table.
**Om-5-1:** And the oven is still on.
**Om-5-4:** So is the TV. It's… it's stuck it seems though. On one frame. It has a calendar for the year of 1952 above it, with uh, 27th of march being the final marked day.
**Dr. Asheworth:** As I said, the previous scans have shown nothing. But if you insist, I'll do a full-spectrum one of the area including all of the anomalous sensors, but that will take a moment.
**Om-5-1:** Understood.
_Five minutes pass. Nothing in the environment of the apartment changes, with the TV still showing the same frame and the meals not changing their temprerature._
**Dr. Asheworth:** Nothing. Again. There is literally not a single lifeform here. Not even bugs.
**Om-5-1:** There's some weird shit going on here, doc. Normal places aren't just stuck in time.
**Dr. Asheworth:** Well, to be honest—
**Om-5-1:** Doc, it seems there _is_ someone behind us.
**Om-5-2:** I can see that, t—
_Om-5-2 is interrupted by an unidentified scream._
**Dr. Asheworth:** Omega five?
_No response._
**Dr. Asheworth:** Omega five, do you copy?!
_Recording cuts._
**[END LOG]**
In order to locate the potentially compromised Omega-5, a temporary replacement hereby referred to as Omega-5A for said group was created, and shortly after dispatched into SCP-5936.

**Subject:** SCP-5936
**Team Lead:** Om-5A-1
**Team Members:** Om-5A-2, Om-5A-3, Om-5A-4
**Foreword:** As standard lifeform scans prior to the exploration have shown an existence of such within the cellars of the block of flats where the original exploration log was abruptly cut, Omega-5-1 was ordered to research said place within the spatial anomaly.
* * *
**[BEGIN LOG]**
**Om-5A-1:** Alright, check your equipment.
**Om-5A-2:** All's fine.
**Om-5A-3:** All well here.
**Om-5A-4:** And here.
**Om-5A-1:** Great. Asheworth, do you copy?
**Dr. Asheworth:** Loud and clear, a-one.
_Omega-5A leave provisional Outpost 120-1 and enter SCP-5936. They head for the building explored within the previous log as before and descent into the basement._
**Om-5A-2:** Command?
**Dr. Asheworth:** Yes?
**Om-5A-2:** It feels, uhh, how to put it, well, much 'calmer' here. The feeling of being watched is just gone.
**Dr. Asheworth:** Which might mean we're onto something. Try to look around and much as you can.
**Om-5A-2:** From what I can see, that's just your normal basement. Some food, this time absolutely rotting may I add, and some containers. Though—
**Om-5A-4:** Here's something.
**Dr. Asheworth:** Yes?
**Om-5A-4:** Well, it's some wet journal pages from what I can see… most of it is some non-sensical gibberish… you seeing this, doc?
**Dr. Asheworth:** Yup. Well, those _are_ thaumaturgic-ish runes, or at least runes stylized after the thaumaturgic ones, but it's too soaked for me to actually study it. At least from here. Also, may I add, it seems that there are some more signs here… I will say that I have never seen anything like this. When you get back, take it with you.
**Om-5A-4:** Roger.
**Om-5A-2:** Something here. Red candles and a candlestick.
**Dr. Asheworth:** Noted. Anything else?
**Om-5A-3:** Hmm…
**Om-5A-4:** Nothing more here it seems. Though three out of five entrances to the other rooms are bricked off.
**Dr. Asheworth:** Go into the closer one then, and let's see what's there.
**Om-5A-4:** Roger.
_Omega-5A come near the entrance to one of the non-blocked rooms._
**Om-5A-1:** Another rune. A bit different from the last one from what it looks like.
**Dr. Asheworth:** Give me a second then, let me get my notes on those ones… Got it. Alright, this one's supposed to be 'protection', as simple as that is. It's still written in a very old language, though. What about the inside of the room?
**Om-5A-1:** It seems that there's nothing more here than some sort of a cork board connecting different photos of the town. And a bunch of chairs around it.
**Om-5A-2:** Some more notes here. Looks pretty similar to the ones from before, though.
**Om-5A-3:** Other than that, it's just your regular basement stuff from what it seems. You know, potato sacks and stuff like that.
**Dr. Asheworth:** Alright, that only leaves the second room, then.
**Om-5A-4:** Looks like today's your lucky day, doc. Another rune. Looks like the one from before, though. And another cross around it. This time, with a, uh, a message, I guess? "The hand of the Lord shall protect you".
**Dr. Asheworth:** Hmmm… it's not the same. It looks almost identical, but the bottom part of the right side is missing, see? It's another one of those weird amalgamations of signs. Hmm…
**Om-5A-1:** _Coughs_ Oh my Jesus fucking Christ. _Coughs_
**Om-5A-2:** Eugh…
**Om-5A-1:** It looks like we found the lifeforms you detected. Or, rather, their bodies.
_Om-5A-1's camera equipment zooms into a small pit dug in the room's floor. Inside of it, approximately twelve bodies lay._
**Dr. Asheworth:** Are they of Omega-5's?
**Om-5A-1:** I highly doubt it. They look nothing like them.
**Om-5A-2:** It's mostly people with robes from what I see.
**Dr. Asheworth:** Do they have anything unusual on them?
**Om-5A-3:** Yeah, got something. Another journal or pamphlet or something. Almost identical to the rest.
**Om-5A-4:** Yep, this one has one, too.
**Dr. Asheworth:** Hmm… it seems it was a dead-end. Goddamnit. Alright, head back to 120-1, we'll think of something more.
**Om-5A-1:** Roger that.
_Omega-5A leave the basements and head out to provisional Outpost-120._
**Om-5A-1:** Uh… doc..?
**Dr. Asheworth:** Yes?
**Om-5A-1:** It seems that, uh, Omega-5 is here.
**Dr. Asheworth:** What?!
**Om-5A-1:** They are just standing approximately ten meters from us. Not moving. It's… a-three, what the hell are you doing?! We have no idea what might be-
_Om-5A-3 attempts to walk towards Omega-5. At this point, an SCP-5936 entity manifests near Om-5A-3._
**Dr. Asheworth:** A-three, leave the vicinity of Omega-5 and the entity, do you under-
_SCP-5936-1 starts to scream with a feminine voice, shaking violently._
**Om-5A-1:** Doc, we have a sit—
_Om-5A-3 falls on her knees. She joins the screaming and shaking, which quickly stops. SCP-5936-1-1 does not stop to scream, with the tone of the voice hanging to a feminine one. It disappears. Om-5A-1 gets up from his knees and starts to walk towards the rest of the Mobile Task Force._
**Om-5A-1:** a-three?
_Silence_
**Om-5A-1:** A-three, do you copy?
_Om-5A-3's walking speed begins to quicken._
**Om-5A-1:** A-three, if you do not answer right now, I will have to open fire, do you understand?!
_Om-5A-3 begins to run towards the group. Omega-5A open fire. Om-5A-3 laughs in a masculine voice._
**Om-5A-1:** Doc, y-you saw that?
**Dr. Asheworth:** I did.
_Five more entities similar to SCP-5936-1-1 manifest near the group. They start to walk towards them. Omega-5 members de-manifest._
**Dr. Asheworth:** Boys, get the hell out of there!
**Om-5A-1:** Let's go!
**[END LOG]**
Following the second exploration, all of the written logs found within the cellar were submitted to Dr. Asheworth's translation team. Research into the SCP-5936-1 entities is currently ongoing.

> From comparing the mostly destroyed texts, I have been able to, so far, translate what I presume to be approximately one-third of the final product.

Shortly after the translation of Addendum 5936-1 was completed, Mobile Task Force Omega-5A was dispatched into SCP-5936 for the second time. The exploration was focused on the previously unexplored outskirts of the anomaly, but was cut short due to an increasing amount of SCP-5936-1 entities manifesting in the area. Though no casualties were recorded, a total of 27 previously unregistered anomalous humanoids were reported. No traces of Omega-5 were detected during the exploration. Though no notable discoveries were made, the team found deteriorated segments of a thaumaturgic circle around the borders of SCP-5936.

#### **Addendum 5936-2 — Event 5936-1**
Three days after the third exploration of SCP-5936 had taken place, the amount of SCP-5936-1 entities manifesting near the border between SCP-5936 and Outpost-120-1 had increased significantly, by approximately 1600% over the course of said time; a week later, the Outpost was attacked by the entities.
The event has been transcribed below.
[► Log of Event 5936-1](javascript:;)
[▼ Log of Event 5936-1](javascript:;)
**Date:** 22/03/1984
**Foreword:** At the time, Dr. MacCarthy, Site-120 and Outpost-120-1 director, was visiting Outpost-120-1 in order to finalize the translation of documents found within SCP-5936. Dr. Asheworth, the project lead of SCP-5936 was, at that time, away in order to report to Central Europe Regional Director on his team's progress on the project.
* * *
**[BEGIN LOG]**
**Dr. MacCarthy:** …and I believe that concludes my rant. I think that covers everything I wanted to say.
**Jr. Res. Quinn:** Of course. Thank you for your time, director. We will make sure to notify Doctor Asheworth about the translation once he gets back from the report mission.
**Dr. MacCarthy:** No need to thank, ha— M-Miss Quinn, should… should those entities be here…?
_At this point, a total of approximately 102 SCP-5936-1 instances manifest near the entrance to SCP-5936._
**Jr. Res. Quinn:** Uh… No, I don't think so… I will call the project lead to ask, if that's okay-
_Jr. Res. Quinn pulls a phone from her pocket. She attempts to call Dr. Asheworth, only to get no response. She tries to do so three more times, with each of the attempts being denied._
**Jr. Res. Quinn:** Uh, I don't think we're going to get an answer, he's probably busy, but no, I don't think that's the way it should be…
_Twenty-five SCP-5936-1 entities start to vocalize near the entrance to the building._
**Dr. MacCarthy:** Oh, oh my, where's the security here? You must have some sort of thaumaturgic protection here!
**Jr. Res. Quinn:** I don't think we do, sir. Asheworth was the la—
_Fourty SCP-5936-1s leave SCP-5936 and enter Outpost-120-1._
**Dr. MacCarthy:** Oh my god, call the direct regional line, now!
_The man attempts to make his way into the Outpost's management office._
**Dr. MacCarthy:** Quinn, there's no time, come with—
_Director MacCarthy is interrupted as an SCP-5936-1 entity drags Junior Researcher Quinn out of the building._
_The man runs to the previously mentioned room and shuts the door locked. He then presses the immediate emergency button located within the desk of the Outpost Director._
**Dr. MacCarthy:** _Through direct Outpost messaging system:_ All personnel, containment breach imminent, I repeat: con—
_Thirteen entities swarm the entrance to the place of Director MacCarthy's resting. Following 20 seconds of attempted breach, the anomalies properly open the door._
_An SCP-5936-1 starts screaming within the proximity of Dr. MacCarthy. The Director joins in the screaming, only for his voice to change to one resembling a child's._
_Recording cuts as an SCP-5936-1 destroys the camera recording the log._
**[END LOG]**
After this recording of Event 5936-1 was received, all contact with provisional Outpost-120-1 was lost. All individuals present at the time are considered lost and a border around SCP-5936 has been set up. The entrance point to the anomaly has been thaumaturgically sealed. No entrance is currently allowed.

#### NOTICE FROM THE FOUNDATION RECORDS AND INFORMATION SECURITY ADMINISTRATION
The remainder of this file is currently limited to personnel with Level 3 and SCP-5936 Research Team Clearance Level that is not included in regular Level 3 credentials. Until the research on SCP-5936 and its nature is properly concluded, no exceptions to this rule are currently allowed.
— Daniel Asheworth, Head of SCP-5936 Research
  

#### **Addendum 5936-3 — Further Research Material**
To further understand the nature and properties of both SCP-5936 and SCP-5936-1 entities, multiple tests and interrogation missions were undertaken. The following are their reported results.
[► Additonal Files — SCP-5936 — 1](javascript:;)
[▼ Additonal Files — SCP-5936 — 1](javascript:;)
## `Background interrogation for the location of SCP-5936`
In order to ascertain the nature and location of SCP-5936 prior to the presumed ritual being carried out near it, a background check has been requested by its research team.
Initially, no recordings of any inhabitants or even the existence of any sub-town area located within the area occupied by SCP-5936 existing in the past were found upon coming into contact with local archival offices and authorities. A detailed search revealed that no place had ever existed — plans of creating a sub-area almost identical to the landscape of SCP-5936 were in fact created in 1945 following the end of World War II, but were canceled due to a lack of budget reported within the yearly spending plan of the new communistic rule established upon Poland following the end of said event.
However, when the local population census and the documents surrounding such for the years of 1952 — 1984 was in-dethply studied by Site-120's RAISA employees, exactly one mention of a wanted individual know as Damien Nowak, originating from a nonexisting district of Częstochowa referred to as "Tysiąclecie Dolne", which would, as referred by in documents, be located in the exact location SCP-5936 manifests in.
Further background search on Nowak undertaken by Dr. Rivera, a member of the research team of SCP-5936 trained in memetic resistance, revealed that a district identical to the inside of SCP-5936 did indeed exist; backchecking on previously analyzed documents by Dr. Rivera yielded surprising results — every single one of them did discuss the existence of such a district; the information was, however, locked behind an antimeme.
The recovered data holds that Tysiąclecie Dolne was an actual, existing place, holding the population for approximately 1200 residents, distributed as follows:
  * 200 men
  * 400 women
  * 600 children

Due to the recentness of the building project when in the context of the recent ending of World War II ending prior to the even taking place, most of the population of Tysiąclecie Dolne consisted of women and children. The population and the buildings were in great disrepair due to the military actions undertaken by opposing forces during the conflict. It is of note that the population had requested more capital for the purpose of building renovation from local authorities on multiple occasions — all of such were denied.
The current hypothesis constructed by the currently available material regarding SCP-5936, such as the ritual translation provided by Dr. Asheworth and external papers discussing the place, holds that the line in the poetic ritual instructions describing "deleting a region" should be interpreted literally; in result, the thaumaturgic action not only presumably killed the people located within the region, but literally deleted it and alongside all of the mentions of it from history.
Further research is ongoing.

[▼ Additonal Files — SCP-5936 — 2](javascript:;)
## `Additional material recovered from SCP-5936`
Upon taking the previously mentioned hypothesis into consideration, Dr. Asheworth personally requested more contextual material be attempted to recover from SCP-5936 in hopes of confirming or denying such. The project was successfully approved, and a UEV[2](javascript:;) was sent from local regional command to Site-120, where the research team gathered the needed materials and sent the vehicle into SCP-5936. Notably, the entities within such did not recognize the UEV as existing within their reach and did not react to the vehicle's actions.
Upon in-depth exploration of the remaining buildings, an intact journal was found. The following writing from the journal has been translated from Polish.
12.03
  
  
Damien wrote to me again this morning. Though normally, I wouldn't be surprised, this time he asked me for shelter. Normally I would of course deny, the food and water supplies are low even for as little as my men have here, but I couldn't just say "no" to my own brother. Not after all these years of separation from each other. Maria says it's stupid to let him near us after what he's done all those years ago, but it just feels wrong. Especially since he said that he has changed and that no longer will he practice… the forbidden arts.  
  
I'll have to think about it.

Damien and his troupe of freaks came last night. Of course, he couldn't resist his usual bullshit; everyone must know when he is in town. This time was a bit different though; his "friends" came with numerous gifts — meat, vegetables, and clean water. For all of these uneducated morons, they were glorious saviors that came to save them from the oppression of the "government". I'll let them think that for as long as I need to, but I know that something must be wrong. It's not like him to just help people profitless.  
  
When I asked him what all of that fuss was about, he said, and I quote — "Greetings, my fellow brother! I come to you with peace!". It's… it's not like him! He was ecstatic, clearly very happy at something, and… nice for once! He was babbling about how serving some "Lord" made him finally reunite with his previous enemies and give others happiness. I don't know if I should be afraid or happy or… I don't know.

Last night, I caught Damien writing some weird symbols on the walls of my house with chalk. When asked about what that was, all he said was that I should not worry, since all he has ever done is to serve our Lord. I know he's lying, he never could just fit the rest and worship our God like the rest of us. Whatever he's doing, I'm sure it's nothing good — no normal person dresses like a religious guru for no reason!  
  
It seems his freaks have permanently settled within our basement. It's not like I care, they don't eat anything and they don't litter, but I can't just sleep safely at night knowing that… these things… sit in my town. They don't seem right. Damien says something about them being "sinners who decided to change their ways and return to the ways of the Lord". Thankfully, they very rarely get out of their dwellings — and when they do, they mostly just patrol the outskirts of the town, not bothering anyone.

Damien was writing weird stuff on the walls today again. When confronted, he said it's "for the Lord's grace" and that they mean protection in his "language". Initially, I obviously didn't believe him, but when nothing happened when a raid of our beautiful government's "helpers" didn't come, I just couldn't not believe him. Everything he said came true. Maybe he has truly changed. I… I don't know. It seems like those freaks he brought with him are… decent people too? They help us with our crops, and one of them saved Annie from drowning. I have no idea what to think anymore.

My people seem to absolutely love Damien. He has become their savior, their martyr, their… leader? It's sort of worrying how quickly he got popular, but I can't just not be happy my brother is with us, normal again. He is also… nice to everybody? It seems that even Herbert somehow enjoys his company. I… I've never been this torn apart in my life. Deep in my heart, I know he is a good person, but I can't just shake off the feeling of something being wrong. Though I feel like I'm alone in my emotions - everyone seems to have accepted him as a part of our community, which of course is a good thing, it's been a long time since that happened last time, but… I don't know. I'll have to think some more.

Last night, I eavesdropped on Damien, hoping to find _something_ on him. Nothing. Again. He just prayed and went to sleep. That's all. I… I was wrong, then it seems. Is Damien truly a new person? Everything leads me to believe so, but… I just… I don't know!  
  
Everything is of course going well since he arrived, as I said, and no one was even hurt. Not a single bad thing. Maybe something did indeed change?
30.03
  
  
Damien is indeed a changed man. From when he arrived, nothing bad has happened to us. Every single oppressor that previously would bother doesn't even seem to notice us. Our plants grow faster and children are happier. When I asked him how this could be true, he just said "You should trust me and Lord more, brother."  
  
I asked him to stay more with us, and he happily accepted the offer, saying that we will finally get some good time together. During today's dinner, he announced that in just three days, everything will change for the better; of course, he didn't say what would happen, but he said that "the Lord will be pleased when he sees what will" in an excited tone alongside something about "ascending" and "leaving the human sadness and the limitation of our bodies behind".  
  
I shouldn't be this happy, but I truly am glad that he finally found himself a good road in life.

## `SCP-5936 Test Logs`
On 21/04/1984, four hundred SCP-5936-1 instances started to manifest near the border of the spatial anomaly and started to violently vocalize for approximately 36 hours straight. The action was immediately notified to the project lead and assessed for further research value when such an event did not happen again for the next two weeks. Three days following the action being reported however, the event repeated - this time with approximately 600 humanoids involved.
The following is a transcript of the audio created by the humanoids.
> **[[0-14h]]** unintelligible screaming  
>  **[[15-25h]]** nonsensical noices  
>  **[[25-36h]]** unintelligible screaming  
>  Following the finishing of this cycle, all of the entities demanifested.
Initially, it seemed that said audio was non-sensical and logic-lacking. When regular, nonanomalous audio editing and analyzing software yielded no results upon being presented with the recording, the audio was put through Foundation-made machines. It was then discovered that the true sounds admitted by the entities were being blocked by an artificial, thaumaturgic force bearing message-encrypting properties, whose origin has been dated to 1956.
The true transcript of the messages is provided below.
All of the messages are being repeated within the written timeframe by an amalgamation of approximately 1200 different voices.  
  
**[[0-14h]]** H-hello? Are you still out there? P-please, listen to us. Help us. Don't leave us here. We don't have much time. Help us. Give us bodies. Please. Stop this. Help us. Please, please help us. We're sorry. Please give us bodies. Please let us leave.  
  
**[[15-25h]]** A-are you there? Please, I can't. I can't bear this anymore. Why are you doing this to us? Why did they do this to us? Please, let us die. Please, give us rest. Give us bodies. Give us death. Please.  
  
**[[25-36h]]** No, don't leave. Don't leave. Not now, not now. Not now. Give us a body. Give us a physical anchor. We need to leave. Please, give us rest. We need an anchor. Give us something to cling to. We need to leave this state. Don't leave us. Don't leave. Don't.  
Don't forget us.
  
Further research is ongoing.

I have successfully been able to finalize the translation of the documents acquired within SCP-5936. Though most of the written text was merely an invocation, the name of what I presume to be the cults' is being mentioned near the bottom of it. Additionally, my men have found a potentially troubling picture within a journal in the innards of the bodies Omega-5A have discovered. I will be honest with you and say I do not have a single idea of what this could indicate; further research in the highlighter areas is definitely going to be required. Please familiarize yourself with both and share your thoughts on the matter.

[\- ACCESS GRANTED](javascript:;)
To break the seal that must come first;  
a thousand bodies must offer one.  
A rift in time it shall create,  
freezing a place when the ritual's done.
Take the bodies the ritual shall,  
but leave the souls it will.  
One must account for their raging thoughts,  
as they might want to take back the bill.
Around the town a circle must,  
surround it fully within.  
To cover yourself, and your soul,  
a safe sign you must bring.
The souls shall seek revenge  
as after all, easily does not one die.  
Though gone, the region is,  
they might want it to come back.
**— the Children**
one seal - one-fifth of Heaven  
  
  
is it really worth it?  
for Father, it is  
  
  
but what if people think we're the bad ones?  
doesn't matter  
  
  
once we bring Heaven  
all will  
stop  
cease  
be happy
remember the goal  
for Heaven, it is worth it
