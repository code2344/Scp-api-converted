(The sound of a door opening and closing.)

Engle:

 Oh, hey.

Voice:

 Just one of those days, huh?

Engle:

 I won’t say I disagree.

Cho:

 Got some more files for you.

(The sound of a stack of papers impacting the desk.)

Engle:

 Thanks.

Cho:

 So what’re you thinking? Anart piece? Some kind of ritual?

Engle:

 Well, Forensics haven’t gotten back with the victim’s identity, so could be anything, really. It might be a crime of passion, if the anomalous properties are anything to go by.

Cho:

 Oh, yeah, makes it a pain in the ass to deal with. I keep seeing– 

(coughs)

 I keep seeing people in Forensics having to step away, tears in their face. And I mean I don’t blame them, like, I know it’s fake, but doesn’t change the fact it looks like my fiancé’s severed head on a pike. Say, what does it look like to you?

Engle:

 …I’d rather not talk about it.

Cho:

 Fair enough. Sorry for bringing it up.

Engle:

 It’s fine.

(Pause.)

Cho:

 Welp, I’m gonna head back. See you later, man.

Engle:

 Bye.

(The sound of a door opening and closing.)

(Shuffling papers. Engle mumbles something unintelligible in a sing-song tone.)

(Office phone rings. Engle picks it up)

Engle:

 Hel-

 The ball has been set in motion.

Engle:

 Excuse me?

Unknown Voice:

 Listen well, we won’t repeat this twice. 14/07/2012, Portland, Maine. Remember it? It should be fresh in your mind.

Engle:

 …What is this?

Unknown Voice:

 Trust everyone and no one. It is perpetual motion run amok, but the flight plan can be adjusted. Find a map.

(The phone line disconnects, playing a dull tone.)

Engle:
