Description

42

:

 

SCP

-4893 is a humanoid that causes 

synesthesia

43

44

 in the reader where stimulation by 

texts

 written by 

SCP

-4893 produces visions of synonymous flowers in the floriography. The person who 

sees

45

 the 

texts

 written by 

SCP

-4893 will acquire the same 

anomaly

46

 as 

SCP

-4893 (

SCP

-4893-A).

SCP

-4893 was discovered with an 

anomalous

 

poetry book

47

(

SCP

-4893-1) in 

1550

 when the rumor that a flowering 

book

 was 

found

 in a village outside 

Maastricht, The Netherlands

48

, caught 

the Foundation

's interest. 

The Foundation

 initially 

viewed

 

SCP

-4893-1 as the cause of the 

anomaly

, but the 

former

49

 owner of 

SCP

-4893-1(

SCP

-4893-A-1) confessed he created 

SCP

-4893-1. As a result SCP-4893-A-1 was found to be the main cause of the 

anomaly

.

When an individual 

reads

 an instance of 

SCP

-4893, they become an instance of 

SCP

-4893-A, and the instance's writings acquire the properties of 

SCP

-4893 

until death

50

. Prior to 

1758

, 

D-class

51

 were exposed to 

SCP

-4893 in order to maintain at least one extant instance of 

SCP

-4893-A, but repeated 

containment

52

 breaches led to the adoption of current 

containment procedures

53

.

+ For SCP-4893 Head Researcher's eyes only

- To my successor

First of all, 

54

 on the promotion.

From today, you are the 

55

 researcher of 

56

-4893, and thus 

-4893 itself. It'll be very difficult for you to 

57

 this 

58

, but you'll get used to it soon.

Well, you might be wondering. Why do I have to become 

-4893? Why not use 

59

?

It was like that at first when 

-4893 was 

. In fact, 

-4893 has been 

60

 for many years by 

61

, young 

. But there is something very different now: the literacy rate. Now many people can read and write 

 in 

62

 and 

63

 countries. Inevitably, the possibility of exposure to 

-4893's 

64

 has increased. Any 

 written or typed by 

-4893 is a source of infection. There have been cases in which a 

 who have 

 

-4893 in the past carved 

 on the wall and made many of the 

65

 become 

-4893.

Our 

66

67

 is "

68

, 

69

,

70

". It is not good enough to just 

 and 

 any 

. It is therefore best to choose 

-4893's 

 from among 

71

72

73

 personnel who can understand the 

's 

 and carry it out. 

 what we have 

 and 

. And someday you will 

74

 the 

75

 to someone else.
