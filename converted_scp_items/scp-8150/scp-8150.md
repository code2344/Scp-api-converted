SCP-8150-1 instance approaching Stratford, Texas in 1935
**Object Class:** Ku≈°um[1](javascript:;)
**Special Containment Procedures:** Due to the nature of SCP-8150, and the catastrophic failure of prior containment attempts, further efforts have been abandoned. Any deaths caused by SCP-8150 are to be reported as casualties of the publicly-accepted concept of "dust storms". research efforts are also postponed indefinitely, due to the high amounts of casualties taken during Incident SCP-8150-I. The publicly-perceived notion of the Dust Storm is to be upheld, as to avoid the true nature of SCP-8150 from being discovered. While containment efforts have been abandoned, damage control and evacuation efforts related to SCP-8150-1 instances are to be handled by MTF-Rho-10 "Dust Devils".
**Description:** SCP-8150 is the collective name for the phenomena publicly known and accepted as "Dust Storms". In reality, "Dust storms" are an anomalous species of sentient storm systems, hereby referred to as SCP-8150-1. SCP-8150-1 instances vary widely in size, depending on the amount of Elan Vital Energy (EVE) absorbed. The largest documented SCP-8150-1 instance, publicly known as the "Black Sunday Storm" reached 800 miles long and 400 miles wide. The exact method and reasoning to how SCP-8150-1 instances form is unknown, as it is impossible to predict when and where they will, and there is a lack of living witnesses to SCP-8150-1 forming events. SCP-8150-1 instances "pull" the EVE out of an organism before dispersing it into its cloud. Fatalities from SCP-8150-1 instances can only be avoided by donning protective equipment with full CBRNA protection.
A full log of notable SCP-8150 related incidents can be found below.
**Incident SCP-8150-A:** Publicly known as the "Dust Bowl", a large uptick in SCP-8150-1 activity during the 1930s led to severe ecological devastation, along with over 7,000 dead. These included several Foundation researchers and agents, but consisted mostly of civilians. The largest of these instances was the Black Sunday storm, or SCP-8150-1C. The size of SCP-8150-1C was due to the amounts of EVE absorbed by it and its contributing storms. Over its lifespan, multiple people were killed, but due to the lack of Foundation resources at the time, containment efforts were not pursued.
**Incident SCP-8150-D:** Publicly known as the "Great Bakersfield Dust Storm", in 1977 an SCP-8150-1 instance manifested near Bakersfield, California, before moving into the area to harvest EVE. In total, 25 people died, however Foundation agents were able to suppress the knowledge of 20 of these deaths, leaving the publicly accepted tally at 5. While not a particularly significant event, this incident directly lead to the founding of MTF-Rho-10.

**Overview:** On November 29 1991, an SCP-8150-1 instance manifested around 43 miles north of Coalinga. Having received notification from US Government assets at Naval Air Station Leemore, and due to the storm's close and rapidly closing proximity to Interstate 5, MTF-Rho-10 was quickly scrambled and dispatched to attempt containment efforts.

**After Action Report:**  
After Rho-10 evacuated a total of 12 civilians from I-5, additional Foundation assets set up a perimeter to prevent further loss of life. After the SCP-8150-1 instance dissipated, Foundation S&R teams moved in to assess damage. A total of 104 cars had piled up, with 17 having died from collisions. A further 46 people had died from SCP-8150, including Sergeant Amy Lawson.
**Incident SCP-8150-H:** On January 4th, 2002, an SCP-8150-1 instance manifested several miles west of Las Vegas, Nevada. MTF-Rho-10 was scrambled under personal orders from then Captain Arnold Holmes, and they successfully prevented the instance from growing by terminating wildlife in the area and preventing any civilian entry. Due to their professionalism and efficiency in this mission, Captain Holmes was promoted to Task Force command, with Lieutenant Barry Keyestone now taking command of Rho-10. Due to the lack of casualties, this incident was hidden from the public.

_Transport containing MTF-Rho-10 lands. Team Disembarks._
**Lt Keyestone:** Alright! All transports stay where you are. We're gonna need pilots out of their seats to help the villagers settle in. 2, 3, and 5 with me. We're taking east. Harper, you take some of the Valkyries and search the west side.
**Spc Harper:** Roger!
**Lt Keyestone:** No rest for the wicked gentlemen, techs from HQ say we've got about 4 hours before the cloud heads over here. Pass out gas masks as you go, it's gonna take a few trips to get everyone out of here.

**Sigma-9 Pilot:** We're away, that's another 24!
**Lt Keyestone:** Copy that, we'll have more when you're back.
**Rho-10 Dispatch:** All personnel, all personnel. High priority notification from mission control. The storm is moving far faster than expected. It seems to be moving more directly towards the village than prior instances. Recommend checking your EVE sensors for any abnormal readings.
**Lt Keyestone:** Alexi, get on that!
**Sgt Borodin:** Yessir.
_Sgt Borodin takes out EVE detection equipment, begins scanning environment._
**Lt Keyestone:** Command, what's the ETA on that cloud?

**Sigma-9 Pilot:** SHIT! We're in the cloud! The shit's getting inside!
_Valkyrie-3 begins spinning out as pilot loses consciousness._
**Lt Keyestone:** FUCK! All transports, GO GO GO! Get the hell out! Dust Bunnies, Mount up, we're leaving!
**Sgt Borodin:** GOD FUCKING DAMMIT BARRY LISTEN TO ME!
**Lt Keyestone:** WHAT?
_Cloud begins to enter area. Interference from wind audible. The remainder of Rho-10 enters the Osprey. Lt Keyestone is stood at the bottom of the ramp._
**Sgt Borodin:** It's you, Barry! The storm is going for you! Your EVE is all over the place.
**Lt Keyestone:** Roger that. Sigma-9. Touch off. We've done what we can.
**Sigma-9 Pilot:** Understood.
**Lt Keyestone:** I know what I need to do.
_Lt Keyestone steps off the ramp. The remaining aircraft begin takeoff._
**Sgt Borodin:** Sir? What are you doing?! SIR GET ON THE OSPREY!
**Lt Keyestone:** It's too late Alexi. I'd only be taking the storm with me. It's been an honor, Dust Devils. Keystone signing off.
**Sgt Borodin:** Solid copy boss. Die well.

**Lt Keyestone:** Shit‚Ä¶ something special about me, huh? That's news.
_Storm intensity peaks._
**Lt Keyestone:** Guess I'd better get my affairs in order huh? Well, if anyone hears this, get it to my son.
_Lt Keyestone removes headcam, and places it facing him._
**Lt Keyestone:** I love you kid. I always have. I wish I could've seen you more, but it's too late for that. Stick with your mom, stick with your brother. You're good people Atlas. I love you.
_Keyestone stands up, and walks away from the camera._
**Lt Keyestone:** I don't know what you things are. Hell, I doubt you know you're hurting people.
_Storm continues to rush around Keyestone._
**Lt Keyestone:** Enough pretense. I know when I'm not welcome.
