SCP-6737-B-009, KLM 932
**Special Containment Procedures:** Mobile Task Force Tau-14 ('Dutch Shepherds') will monitor air traffic and acquire the flight manifest of every wide-body cargo and passenger airliner destined for Amsterdam Airport Schiphol (AMS) between Friday at 11:00 and Saturday at 11:00. All abnormalities between flight manifest at time of take-off and at time of landing are to be investigated for the presence of SCP-6737-A. Upon acquisition of SCP-6737-A, MTF Tau-14 will bring subject to Anthropoid Site-48 for assessment. By Order of the Ethics Committee, eligibility for Reintegration Protocol is to be determined on a case-by-case basis; See **Reintegration Protocol #6737** for further details.
**Description:** SCP-6737 is a recurring anomaly affecting flights to Amsterdam Airport Schiphol (AMS). Within a weekly 24-hour timeframe, a varying number[1](javascript:;) of individuals (designated SCP-6737-A) will appear within AMS or onboard any number of wide-body aircraft (designated SCP-6737-B) inbound to the airport. Each instance of SCP-6737-A possesses a simulacrum of the identity of an individual who has gone missing and is presumed dead prior to manifestation. SCP-6737-B typically either departs from or has a layover at the international airport nearest to SCP-6737-A's last known whereabouts or the potential location of their remains.
SCP-6737-A subjects do not recall the immediate circumstances of their disappearance and react with unease when informed of traumatic experiences. Instances of SCP-6737-A display intricate false memories which create the belief of having lived a normal life leading up to the decision to board SCP-6737-B. This belief may be superficially supported by personal effects manifested with SCP-6737-A.
**Addendum- Discovery:** The first three SCP-6737-A instances manifested on 02/05/2014.
  * American Airlines 2610 departed from Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport (KVG) at 06:40 EST, arriving at AMS at 12:20 CET. SCP-6737-A-001 identified as Lee Ellison, age 18 at time of acquisition. SCP-6737-A-001 was the subject of a missing persons investigation since 19/02/2009, declared a homicide 03/04/2009. Murray Souza would be convicted of her murder and two others in the Cincinnati area; although blood evidence was crucial in the trial, Ellison's remains were never located. SCP-6737-A-001 sent the following text messages to the mother of Ellison:

_< SCP-6737-A-001 has a correspondence with the mother over video call, prompting her to alert media and authorities.>_
  * At 18:30 CET, KLM 838 arrived from Singapore Changi Airport (SIN) carrying SCP-6737-A-002, identified as Min Jiang, age 38. Jiang was last documented 15/02/1999. Subject allegedly ceased contact with her parents in Suzhou, China due to an interpersonal dispute, and abandoned her apartment intact, her family never receiving correspondence until after appearance at AMS.

  * At 19:10 CET, Aeromexico 553 arrived after layover at Cancun International Airport (CUN). SCP-6737-A-003 identified as Roman da Silva, age 27, a Brazilian national who went missing on 05/06/2013 during a vacation trip to Mexico. During a recreational scuba diving excursion in the Gulf of Mexico, subject was separated from his diving group and never found. After manifestation at AMS, SCP-6737-A-003 began posting to social media images of himself at various locations in the city and was inundated with incredulous messages asking his whereabouts.

All subjects were discovered, contained, and interviewed at various points in time. Information released by and in relation to each subject has been suppressed. The following week, 12 SCP-6737-A instances manifested within a 24-hour period on 09/05/2014 and 10/05/2014.
**Addendum- Site-48:** Acquired from Schiphol Group 10/04/1998, Transit Facility-48 (LEY) has been retrofitted from inert Safe-class storage to a site dedicated to humanoid containment. Facility is to be operated under the front group Schiphol Crown Passenger Flights and serve as the primary nexus for the Orientation/Reintegration of SCP-6737-A. Flights with confirmed SCP-6737 activity are permitted to land directly at Site-48 under extenuating circumstances. Approved 25/06/2014. SCP-6737-A instances are to be contained for purposes of research for no more than 3 days before receiving D-Class orientation amended by Order of the Ethics Committee; see **Reintegration Protocol #6737**.

_**< Begin transcript>**_
**Agent Ribeiro:** [Portuguese] Roman, I'm so sorry this has all been so bizarre. Are you ready to talk to Customs now?
**A-003:** [PT] I've said everything. There's nothing wrong with my passport. Do you know how many miles I have?
**Agent Ribeiro:** [PT] Okay, listen. The game is up, we have evidence that 'Roman da Silva' is dead and has been dead for a year. You're the only person that can explain why you have his passport.
**A-003:** [EN] I _am_ goddamn Roman da Silva! [PT] You're out of your damn mind!
**Researcher ██████:** Okay, Roman da Silva.
_< Researcher ██████ produces images of memorial service held for Roman da Silva.>_
**Researcher ██████:** _Tu madre_ [sic] gave us those.
**Agent Ribeiro:** [PT] Why would you put people through this, Roman?
**A-003:** [PT] I… Listen, I don't know what this is. I feel like you're trying to make me insane. I don't know why everyone is saying this.
**Agent Ribeiro:** [PT] So you aren't going to explain your disappearance?
**A-003:** [PT] I can't. I don't understand.
**Agent Ribeiro:** [PT] Roman, do you remember scuba diving in Cancun last year?
**A-003:** [PT] Yes. I also remember coming home from Cancun. They're all wrong.
**Agent Ribeiro:** [PT] Clearly, Roman, you didn't die out there. What else can you tell me?
**A-003:** [PT] Nothing weird happened. Nothing else happened when I went back to Cancun this week. Nothing until I came here and everyone lost their minds.
**Agent Ribeiro:** [PT] You're really confident that you don't have anything to say?
**A-003:** [PT] If I'm under arrest, we can stop talking now.
**Agent Ribeiro:** [PT] Roman, would you like to see a neurologist? I've never seen amnesia quite like this.
**A-003:** [PT] I'm not crazy, alright. I'll take a brain scan to prove it.
**Researcher ██████:** What are we saying?
**Agent Ribeiro:** He's ready for intake.

**Researcher Osman:** Hello Frédéric, you understand how this memory enhancer works?
**A-314:** Yes.
**Researcher Osman:** You understand that we need to get the facts straight if we want your family to get back home?
**A-314:** Yes.
**Researcher Osman:** Give us something new. Go through the timeline.
**A-314:** The timeline?
**Researcher Osman:** Start when you were driving into the interior of the country.
**A-314:** We left from Casablanca to see some of the only forests in Morocco. We went through the Atlas Mountains. Then we went back. Do you want me to say it ten more times?
**Researcher Osman:** The point of the drug administered is to help you sift through these memories. Please, if you have the tiniest detail, say it again. Anyone you saw on the road, anyone who stopped you. Did you ask for directions?
**A-314:** Just the horse riders.
**Researcher Osman:** Horse riders?
**A-314:** I guess locals. They helped us on the backroads in the mountains.
**Researcher Osman:** Helped you in what way?
_< Silence.>_
**A-314:** I'm not sure. Maybe they weren't on horses.
**Researcher Osman:** At what point did you leave the car behind?
**A-314:** When it was safe.
**Researcher Osman:** Safe?
**A-314:** In the morning it was safe.
**Researcher Osman:** Safe from what?
_< Silence.>_
**A-314:** I'm not sure.

**Personnel Present:** Researcher Osman, Dr. ████████  
**Prior:** Research Osman identified subject from previous Foundation investigation. Subject administered Class-W mnestics.

_**< Begin transcript>**_
  
**Researcher Osman:** Danilo, I'm glad to see you. 
**A-1942:** Uhm, oh yeah. I remember you. I am glad to see you. The investigator.
**Researcher Osman:** Yeah, something like that. Danilo, we gave you that mnestic to talk about that.
**Dr. ████████:** A-1-9-4-2, can you describe the circumstances of your whereabouts after the twentieth of January, 2009?
**Researcher Osman:** Cool it with the canned language. He's been through this before. Can we just talk to him?
**Researcher Osman:** Danilo, do you remember that investigation?
**A-1942:** Yes, yes I do. I'm thankful for your being there. I think the village would've found her, but your work helped immensely.
**Researcher Osman:** Has anyone here debriefed you on your situation?
**A-1942:** No! not at all. I got in their car at the taxiway and they dropped me in this cell. Is it back? Is my wife okay?
**Researcher Osman:** No, it hasn't returned. Your wife is safe in Romania.
**A-1942:** You sent her back!? Can't you tell me what's going on?
**Researcher Osman:** Danilo, I'm sorry. Our records listed you as missing since January. When it happened. Your family was safe, but they never found you. Whatever memories you have, they're a mirage. Another anomaly.
**A-1942:** I'm really not following you. When do I see my wife?
**Dr. ████████:** Researcher, keep the subject focused on topic.
**Researcher Osman:** Danilo, when was the last time you saw the anomaly?
**A-1942:** The ███████?
**Researcher Osman:** Yes. Do you remember seeing the ████ after we last spoke that January?
**A-1942:** Yes. In the countryside. For a few weeks, in the woods by our house. But your guys shot her, didn't you?
**Researcher Osman:** No, Danilo. You and the ███████ weren't seen again. I guess, until now. This is another anomaly, like the ████ was an anomaly. You were placed here in Amsterdam, and your memories to this point aren't accurate.
**A-1942:** I… okay. So when do I get to go home?
**Researcher Osman:** Let's get back on the subject and then we'll see to that.

19/03/2020 | Marcurio Wilson, Age 32; A-6794 | Kam Air 15; Hamid Karzai Int'l Airport (KBL)  
---|---|---  
**Personnel Present:** Head Researcher Osman, Dr. Zhengzhang, █-██  
**Prior:** Subject presented himself to civilian employees at AMS asking to speak with Foundation personnel. Upon apprehending subject, he professed extensive information regarding an anomalous mass casualty event.
* * *
_**< Begin transcript>**_
**Researcher Osman:** Hello, Corporal Wilson, you seem to know why you're here. More than most of the people I talk to.
**A-6794:** Yes, yes I do. I'm the sole survivor of SCP-████ and it needs to be contained.
**Researcher Osman:** I'm not familiar with that one.
**A-6794:** Yeah, I know. They said that's how it works, The memory wiping thing.
**Dr. Zhengzhang:** Sole survivor of what?
**A-6794:** That thing. The ███████ ███.
**Researcher Osman:** What is that?
**A-6794:** The thing you commandeered my platoon for. In ████████, in the hills. Where they are now buried.
**Dr. Zhengzhang:** You need to help us out here Corporal.
**A-6794:** The dark things under that town. ██████ ███ ████. We were on standby to "contain" them. You knew what they were asking of us! You sent us to our deaths.
_< █-██ receives classified documents relevant to a mass casualty event occurring in area described. Subject's assertion that platoon was eliminated while following directives from Foundation was deemed correct, in combat with imminent anomalous activity.>_
**Dr. Zhengzhang:** But, the Foundation did contain the threat over the following few days.
**A-6794:** Yes, we got the better of them.
**Researcher Osman:** And you lived, clearly.
**A-6794:** Clearly.
**Researcher Osman:** Could you tell me how?
_< Silence.>_
**A-6794:** Well… It was a just a miracle of God that I didn't get shot. It was hopeless to stand and fight, so… I routed.
**Researcher Osman:** And the hostiles, they didn't chase you down?
**A-6794:** Well, the… province was Taliban at the time. They probably didn't want to get caught up by Taliban.
**Dr. Zhengzhang:** But _you_ could huff it the couple dozen klicks to Kabul with no provisions?
_< Silence.>_
**A-6794:** I didn't say it was easy.
**Researcher Osman:** Yes, but why are you here of all places? Your commanding officer is back in Afghanistan.
**A-6794:** My C.O. is in that pit. I talked to some guys you brought in. Just trying to make conversation with the weird black-helmet dudes. One of them told me about how this was his last 'assignment', how he was completing his protocol or something. He was interned by your Foundation, he said. Lived in an airport, he said. And he thought he was going back.
**Researcher Osman:** He said all that?
**A-6794:** When the ██████ clearly weren't being held back by our firepower, he started pleading to his commanders. They pulled back on all of us. I saw those ██████ pull him under the dirt. Nothing we could do for them then. It isn't right for you to leave people in the dust like that. It'll come back to you.
**Researcher Osman:** You want us to go dig up a mass grave?
**A-6794:** I mean it. It _will_ come back to you.

**Addendum- Ethical Review:** On 14/11/2016, Researcher Osman submitted a formal complaint to the Ethics Committee, citing three members of MTF Tau-14 and three senior members of the SCP-6737 Research team.

* * *
  
  
I, Researcher Taner Osman, request a hearing of the Council of the Ethics Committee in investigation of operatives within my research assignment, SCP-6737, for extreme ethical violations against the civilian population.
  * I directly accuse Commanding Officers ████████████ and ██████, Intakes Officer ████, and Senior Researchers ████████, ██████, and ███████████ of knowingly running an operation to falsely imprison and traffic members of the civilian public under the pretense of Foundation activity. I believe this operation is both ongoing and funded from research allocations.

I can provide testimony and evidence to the Ethics Committee to support this accusation.  
  
  
  
Awaiting your response,

Researcher was brought before the Ethics Council one hour after submission. 
**Councillors Present:** E-2; E-7; E-9; E-12; E-19; E-40

_**< Begin transcript, 14:00>**_
**E-2:** This hearing of the Ethics Council is in session.
**Researcher Osman:** Hello, Councilpersons. I thank the Committee for their expedience in this matter. I believe the ethical violations I will uncover for the Committee are grave, and it would be an unconscionable blemish on my service to the Foundation to let it continue without remark.
**E-2:** State for the record your qualifications and a description of your research assignment.
**Researcher Osman:** Researcher Osman, Criminalistics, 14 years experience at the Foundation in forensic profiling.
_<**14:01** Researcher Osman gives a truncated summary of anomaly, activity relevant to containment, and his induction into research team.>_
**Researcher Osman:** … I think by the third time someone showed up at A-M-S who's already been on a missing persons case we were interested in, that's when they started to listen to me. I insisted that three days wasn't enough to properly vet these people—
**E-7:** Researcher, are these people? Some of these subjects certainly died. Will you provide evidence that whatever shows up at A-M-S are not simulacra of the deceased?
**Researcher Osman:** Yes, I will. I insisted we needed more time to vet the subjects. That we could lose so much insight to our cold cases by shipping them off to sites unknown less than a week after intake. That we already had the space in Wing D. I successfully campaigned for a few to have their sentences suspended, temporarily. But it was always about the costs of living space, of food and services, that we couldn't keep them for long. In the back of my mind, the numbers didn't parse. The cost of amnestics, the turnover rate on our facilities. Didn't add up.
_<**14:14** Researcher Osman provides a log of instances to the recordkeeper.>_
**Researcher Osman:** Last week, I learned that a majority of subjects labeled 6-7-3-7-A aren't even being taken to Site-48. They get shipped off to black sites, redacted or labeled as auxiliary sites. To my knowledge, these sites do not officially exist. I asked Senior Researcher ████████ about this. He brushed it off as standard protocol. Said it's been done this way for ten months, said that we're overcapacity. He's since dismissed me from all ongoing research projects. But I can assure you, those numbers on the record that say, for example, seventy instances this week, ninety the next week, I can testify that only a small fraction of those instances were ever seen by the S-C-P-6-7-3-7 Research Team.
**Researcher Osman:** I've used my clearance to go through the logs while I still can. I've collected standouts for you.

_< A-2953 argues in Croatian and some German.>_
**C.O. ████████████:** Got a live one for you, ████.
**Intake Officer ████:** Who is she? What's she's speaking?
**C.O. ████████████:** Russian and German, I think. One of the boys said.
**Intake Officer ████:** Should we get █████ to talk to her?
**C.O. ████████████:** No, we already got her. Galina Perikoc, last seen-
**A-2953:** _To nisam ja! To nije moja putovnica!_[2](javascript:;)
**C.O. ████████████:** Quiet. Last seen in 2009.
**Intake Officer ████:** Alright, I'll get together the paperwork.  

_**< End Log>**_
* * *
**Afterword:** 19/04/2016 Subject was transported to Site-██ on request.
**Researcher Osman:** According to ████████, this is acceptable; standard procedure, even. I speak enough Croatian to know that this woman wasn't Galina Perikoc. She's Croatian, blonde, brown eyes, in her forties, like Galina Perikoc. The passport upon intake said Galina Perikoc. But she's not Galina Perikoc.
_<**14:17** Research Osman produces a Europol notification for missing Croatian woman Julja Emera, dated 17/04/2016.>_
**Researcher Osman:** I contend that the woman identified as A-2-9-5-3 was never Galina Perikoc, and she wasn't missing until we got involved. She was Julja Emera. Last seen onboard Eurowings 2-9-7-7.
_<**14:17** Research Osman produces further items of interests for the record.>_
**Researcher Osman:** I contend, A-1-4-4-4, Mehmet Adallisid, misidentification. A-2-8-9-6, Nikosa Adoyev, not found anywhere close to A-M-S. A-4-1-4-7, Ingard Boyeson, a complete fabrication. Job security for ████████ and ██████ meant sweeping in more subjects for their scheme. All human lives, subjects of greater forces, shipped and sold across our facilities.
**E-12:** Researcher Osman, what estimation of these instances do you contend are false imprisonments?
**Researcher Osman:** The real anomalies are still coming in on schedule. Maybe even at an accelerated rate. I've spoke to them. But if the researcher team never sees most of the inductees, then what facts can I go on? The itineraries of the victims leads me to believe the operation runs around the clock.
**E-9:** I don't doubt your sample, Researcher, but we'll make that assessment after our own audit.
**Researcher Osman:** Beyond that, I believe there are further examples of egregiously misdirecting the research team.

**A-314:** We broke down near Telouet. Camped in the car overnight. Got out in the morning and walked, and there was no one and we left the country on the next flight. Again. Near Telouet.
**S.R. ███████████:** Come on, Freddy, look a little deeper.
**A-314:** I… You hear me? It's… I've told you what there is to say.
**S.R. ███████████:** It's deeper than that, come on. Your family needs these answers.
**A-314:** Listen… I'm sorry. I know it's true. I don't have what you want me to say about them.
**S.R. ███████████:** About who?
_< Silence.>_
**A-314:** It's hard, okay. What happened didn't stick with me at first. Not fully. But if my family needs to know. It's why I'm here. We're here. I'm not going to neglect it anymore. I'm keeping up my part of the deal.
**S.R. ███████████:** What deal?
**A-314:** The light's appearing before me again.
**S.R. ███████████:** What?
**A-314:** Our new lease on life.
**S.R. ███████████:** What new lease on life?
**A-314:** To promise to shed light on their bodies. If they keep us from the grave, we take them to the sunset. To go on in this time once again. See it again in the shade. I let them be with us.

**Findings:** Subject did not regain ability to speak. Per schedule, A-313, A-315 and A-316 approved for D-Class orientation. A-314 and A-317 sent to Site-███ on request.
**Researcher Osman:** Senior Researcher ███████████ elected not to publish this log for the entire Research Team. I've been requesting more mnestic testing for some time, always shot down. Instead, more and more of my subjects came already dosed up on amnestics, already prepped for orientation. There was no intention to investigate them anymore. They must have assumed that everyone had already reduced these people to numbers in their minds. We'd all turn our noses down when looking at these people because of their jumpsuits. But I noticed.
**Researcher Osman:** I submit this evidence for evaluation by the Ethics Council. I believe that the behavior of the 6-7-3-7 team is an unacceptable and malicious violation of the rights of the public and an indefensible use of Foundation resources.
**E-2:** Researcher Osman, the Ethics Council will make a determination of the evidence presented. Your appeal to the Council is heard and you may be called upon in the future for examination of and by the accused.
**Researcher Osman:** Thank you, Councillor.
**E-2:** If there are no further inquiries, this council is dismissed.
