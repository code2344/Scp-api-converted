Okay I can edit this, thank god. My name is Jaiden Emerson. I'm part of the janitorial staff and i was cleaning the lockers and i spilled this on myself. Can anybody read this? its been a few days since i got myself stained with SCP-7155.

 

 

trying to talk with someone and they're just ignoring me. not like them being an asshole but like I'm not there, i should've noted that before, sorry.

 

 

Should probably tell you how I got on this. I stole somebody's credentials (forgot who but i dont really care at this point) and I keep adding comments. Someone reverted my edits so there has to be somebody there reading this.

 

 

I was just going through the numbers and i eventually found this so somebody must know how to undo this paint, right? This stupid paint just 

sticks

 to me.

 

 

I've been scrubbing for hours and my hands hurt and they're bleeding. The paints still there and im still stained. This can't be permanent.

 

 

I wish I had a better job than this. They keep doing all their tests like i wasnt cleaning up right after! Those arrogant assholes.

 

 

That was really mean, sorry. I just wish my friends responded to me is all.

 

 

Somebody has to see this, i'm in the cafeteria. Far back corner near the furthest trash can, you cant miss it, and hopefully you can't miss me

 

 

Im trying to find someone that notices me. I slapped someone, i deleted peoples files, i ripped apart someones papers and everything but they just thought it was other things. they have a new janitor now.

 

 

Fuck you. Fuck this paint can. Fuck this itd been too long i considered shooting someone. i got a bunch of trash and just poured it on someones desk and xey continued like nothing. xey just noted a bad smell and kept doign xeir fucking work. right in the trash

 

 

another day. ive considered it so many times but i just have hope they will notice me someday. maybe tomorrow, thats always another day! another day of hope. another day of this hell

 

 

Doesnt matter anyways. i keep seeing that word. unremarkable. the can is unremarkable, these edits are unremarkable, everything is unre-fucking-markable! Can you believe this shit?

 

 

lookie here! ANOTHER EDIT. Great great graat. When will you take the hint snr fuxking FIX ME before i fufkcin kill one you dumbasses

 

 

sorry. sorry for that last update im not doing so well today. i just want to talk to someone again

 

 

i accidentally cut myself today. at least its something.

 

 

Not surprised, honestly. Who would care for a random janitor like me? I bet the foundation goes through them daily

 

 

should i. no.

 

 

feeling weeks of nothing, at least pain is something i can go with. i grabbed someones knife and cut my arm, handing it back. he didnt notice it! he just kept fucking eating. kept eating his fucking shitty pork.

 

 

i did it some more. not like it matters, really. my blood is staining the counters, desks, everywhere. they havent noticed it. eventually theyll have to

 

 

if im going to die alone i can take someone with me. I am not just going to do this alone. i stole credentials for it.

 

 

grabbed the fucking thing. walked out the chamber, nobody bat an eye. i poured it everywhere. i soaked them. i covered the bastards in paint. theyre drenched. i dont know whats going to happen to them but frankly i dont care. they deserve to know what i feel

 

 

its been a few days and the paint is on them but guess fckin what? theyre still goin around having all their fun and talking to people.

 

 

they washed it off them. they forgot about the computers and stuff in the chanber but hey. better than me

 

 

nothing, nothing again. i want to tear myself to shreds i hate this paint i hate this i hate myself

 

 

I cut myself and bled all over someones food and the floor in the cafeteria. they didn't notice it but said the food tasted unremarkable before walking away. i bled on the ground and nobody is doing anything about it

 

 

new janitor, someone else in my room, no trace of me anywhere in this site. just me, and this stain. i dont even exist anymore, do I?

 

 

I cant do this any longer. I was replaced. New janitor from before is in my room, all my stuff was thrown away

 

 

i hate myself. if my issues from before wasnt enough. i never believed i would amount to anything, guess dad was right.

 

 

I cut off my hand today to try and free myself. i cut it off and its bleeding everywhere. I look down at whats left and the paint is still there. My blood is stained black

 

 

why do i bother. ill get back at them for this, if its the last thing i do

While these events are likely not connected, it is to note that a foul smelling odor emanated from Janitor Carrie's private dorms several days after the final edit to SCP-7155's file.
