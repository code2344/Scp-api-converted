SCP-7704 prior to containment
**Special Containment Procedures** The Alboran Sea and its beaches are to be closed off to the general public under the notice of dangerous currents. Trespassers who pass the exclusion zone are to be detained and searched, followed by amnestization and release. As of 12/11/2003, The Foundation had constructed a 450-meter concrete dome with the exterior layered in iron above and around SCP-7704. This is to mitigate its effects on the ocean such as bubble emission and temperature.
To communicate with SCP-7704-1, interviewers will use the KEPLER-200 hydrophone[1](javascript:;) and the ZION-A400 receiver.[2](javascript:;) With this, SCP-7704-1 is to be monitored weekly so that it remains within SCP-7704.
Lastly, traversal through SCP-7704 requires the approval of Director Rodrigo Mosa. Doing so without permission will result in being administered Class-C amnestics followed by immediate excommunication from The Foundation. (See Addendum-3)

Location of SCP-7704
**Description** SCP-7704 is a thaumaturgic dome of fire sitting on the Alboran seabed, between 800 and 1000 meters below surface level. SCP-7704 is 223 meters tall and 385 meters wide with its exterior heat being recorded at approximately 1000Â°C. Currently, it does not spread, nor can it be extinguished. SCP-7704 does not seem to be utilizing any flammable fuel, anomalous or otherwise, that would keep it burning.
The Foundation is able to ascertain the interior dimensions throughout SCP-7704 by using an upgraded Thermal Imaging Camera. The Foundation viewed through SCP-7704 housing SCP-7704-1.
SCP-7704-1 is a humanoid Class IV Reality Bender that is of **the lands of curious people,** capable of manifesting nearly anything a person wishes for so long as they are at close proximity with it. SCP-7704-1 is capable of verbal communication in Spanish.[3](javascript:;)
It is unknown whether SCP-7704-1 was someone that had been transfigured to be **a caged stranger** or **an odd forest folk** that has said personâs memories.
**Discovery:** In 1997, local deep divers in Spain spread stories that they followed a large density of rising bubbles down to a massive bright spot in the depths of the seabed. Foundation agents administered amnestics to explorers and civilians and spread a cover story that the divers were hallucinating due to lack of oxygen.
The Foundation deployed an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle codenamed PERCIVAL to investigate the seabed. PERCIVAL descended to 780 meters below the surface until its hydrophone picked up the sound of breathing.
After PERCIVAL's discovery of SCP-7704-1, The Foundation began constructing the containment dome for SCP-7704. On 02/19/2004, The Foundation dropped a KEPLER-200 and a ZION-A400 directly above SCP-7704 so that SCP-7704-1 could communicate with Foundation personnel. The interviews were assigned to Intel Collector and Senior Researcher LÃ­a Blanca to record accounts of SCP-7704-1.

**< BEGIN LOG>**
**Blanca:** Hello? Can you hear me?
**SCP-7704-1:** I can.
**Blanca:** Good, audio checks out. Could you tell me a little about yourself?
**SCP-7704-1:** I am a servant. Here to grant you whatever you desire.
**Blanca:** Is that so?
**SCP-7704-1:** But first, you must meet me.
**Blanca:** Meet you where?
**SCP-7704-1:** Here. At the center.
_(Brief pause.)_
**Blanca:** Is there another way we could see you?
**SCP-7704-1:** My apologies, but this is the only way.
**Blanca:** Could you specify what you mean by "granting our desires."
**SCP-7704-1:** I can make you a ruler. I can give you infinite wealth. Great strength. Heal any illness. I can do anything and everything that you ask of me.
**Blanca:** Would you like to demonstrate this?
**SCP-7704-1:** â¦ I cannot.
**Blanca:** But didn't you say-
**SCP-7704-1:** I said you must meet me. Is that so hard to understand?
**Blanca:** So we need to go through those fires?
**SCP-7704-1:** Indeed.
**Blanca:** Could you explain to us why that is?
**SCP-7704-1:** _(Exhale)_ It is a long story. One that I am not fond of retelling as of now.
**Blanca:** Alright then. Is there a name you go by?
**SCP-7704-1:** Come back to me when you have your wish.
**< END LOG>**
[â² Close Interview-1 â²](javascript:;)
There was discussion to traverse SCP-7704 and confirm the claims of SCP-7704-1 with the use of D-class personnel within the expedition. However, it was denied due to the belief that sending D-class would be a severe risk to The Veil and The Foundation. The order was to wait until there was further understanding of SCP-7704 and SCP-7704-1, and not enter due to claims alone.

**Interviewed:** SCP-7704-1
**Interviewer:** Senior Researcher LÃ­a Blanca
**Note:** The following is translated from Spanish to English
* * *
**< BEGIN LOG>**
**Blanca:** Hello again.
**SCP-7704-1:** Are you ready for your wish?
**Blanca:** Not yet. I thought maybe we could get to know each other some more.
**SCP-7704-1:** What is there to know?
**Blanca:** I'm sure there's something worthwhile.
**SCP-7704-1:** So youâre not here for a wish? Why do you bother me, then?
**Blanca:** I don't mean to. I just mean-
**SCP-7704-1:** If you don't want it, then leave!
_(Silence for 6 seconds.)_
**Blanca:** Iâm sorry if Iâve upset you.
_SCP-7704-1 scoffs._
**Blanca:** How about we make a deal?
_(No response from SCP-7704-1.)_
**Blanca:** What's something I could give you right now?
_(SCP-7704-1 remains silent for about 4 seconds.)_
**SCP-7704-1:** Some music would be nice.
**Blanca:** Anything specific?
**SCP-7704-1:** Something soft.
**Blanca:** I can make that happen.
**SCP-7704-1:** And what do you want from me in exchange?
**Blanca:** Like I said, I want you to talk about yourself.
**SCP-7704-1:** This is not a wish?
**Blanca:** Does it have to be?
**SCP-7704-1:** Iâ¦ suppose not.
**Blanca:** Great. Give me a moment.
_( After a minute, Blanca plays "ERES TU" by Mocedades. Blanca and SCP-7704-1 listened to the song for 2 minutes and 19 seconds before resuming their conversation.)_
**Blanca:** _(Singing)_ Eres tÃº. Como el fuego de mi hoguera. Eres tÃº. El trigo de mi pan.
_(Blanca allows the song to continue playing. The audio eases its volume until it can no longer be heard, ending the song.)_
**Blanca:** So, what do you think?
**SCP-7704-1:** I have never heard such a song before.
**Blanca:** Do you like it?
**SCP-7704-1:** I do, indeed.
**Blanca:** Iâm glad you think so. This is me and my daughterâs favorite.
**SCP-7704-1:** You have children?
**Blanca:** Mhm. Just the one, though. And you?
**SCP-7704-1:** I did.
**Blanca:** Boy? Girl?
**SCP-7704-1:** Both.
**Blanca:** Mm, I could never with two.
_(Silence)_
**SCP-7704-1:** You're quiet now. What is it?
**Blanca:** Sorry, just remembering this girl being such a bully to her just because she likes to sing aloud.
**SCP-7704-1:** What happened after?
**Blanca:** Got a call from her school about a fight.
**SCP-7704-1:** Did she win?
**Blanca:** You bet.
**SCP-7704-1:** _(Chuckles)_ Very good!
**Blanca:** What about your kids, how were they?
**SCP-7704-1:** Trouble, those little ones.
**Blanca:** I'll say.
**SCP-7704-1:** There was a time when I told them not to go climbing on the dry trees. But-
**Blanca:** They never listen, right?
**SCP-7704-1:** Yes, thank you! I had to carry my boy, Sendino, all the way back home with a twisted ankle.
**Blanca:** Ouch!
**SCP-7704-1:** Of course, he never went back to those trees again.
**Blanca:** Aw. Poor kid.
**SCP-7704-1:** This other time, I was practicing with my sword, and out of nowhere, Sendino was standing behind me. I heard no footsteps or even a whisper. So when I turned, we both screamed like madmen.
**Blanca:** Oh God, was he okay?
**SCP-7704-1:** Thank the Lord, yes. I asked him if he needed anything, but he told me he did not. He then walked away, and I was left standing there. One must wonder why children do the most daft things.
**Blanca:** You and me both.
**SCP-7704-1:** Oh?
**Blanca:** Like, when my daughter was a toddler, she would go to my drawers, take out all of my clothes, crawl in there, and sit.
**SCP-7704-1:** _(Chuckles)_ What? Why would she do that?
**Blanca:** I donât know! And even when I put her back in her crib or put up a barrier, she would still find a way over them and go back to my drawers.
**SCP-7704-1:** And she just sat in there?
**Blanca:** Yes!
**SCP-7704-1:** Perhaps she thought she was riding a horse.
**Blanca:** Maybe. Thank God she turned four. Otherwise, she wouldâve broken them.
**SCP-7704-1:** I can imagine. Would prefer they stayed small.
**Blanca:** Mhm. This is a pretty good start, don't you think?
**SCP-7704-1:** I suppose it is.
**Blanca:** I'll come back with some more music. You just wait for me, okay?
**SCP-7704-1:** Yes, I will be waiting for you.

It managed to get SCP-7704-1 to open up and tell us something. If we are going to know what SCP-7704-1 is and how it got there, then we should try whatever we can to have it talk. Iâll tell him enough about me so that it feels comfortable to reciprocate. Going forward, we can lead with its family.

Itâs too soon to accuse me of that but I understand your worry. Iâll be honest, I canât control what SCP-7704-1 thinks of me if we do share our lives. But how else are we going to get it to talk? I just need some flexibility for this to work, otherwise, whatâs the point of interviewing it for info?

**Interviewer:** Senior Researcher LÃ­a Blanca
**Note:** The following is translated from Spanish to English
* * *
**< BEGIN LOG>**
**Blanca:** Hello again.
**SCP-7704-1:** Wonderful, you have returned.
**Blanca:** Oh, someone's excited.
**SCP-7704-1:** Well, I have not thought of my children in so long, but it's all returning to me. So I thank youâ¦ I never got your name.
**Blanca:** It's Blanca.
**SCP-7704-1:** Blanca. I am truly grateful.
**Blanca:** You're welcome.
**SCP-7704-1:** So what may be on your mind?
**Blanca:** Well, maybe you would wanna tell me more about your kids. Or anyone from your family.
**SCP-7704-1:** Hmm. There is CatallÃ­na.
**Blanca:** Such a pretty name.
**SCP-7704-1:** It was my mother who named her. She told me that would have been my name, had I been a girl.
**Blanca:** Aww. Thatâs adorable!
**SCP-7704-1:** Yes, yes. CatallÃ­na had this gift for crafts and she managed to make this really beautiful bracelet. It was brown leather wrapped in twine with garnets she chipped off and with wax, she stuck the garnet pieces onto the strap. Call me arrogant, but she made fine jewelry that would fit Queen Joanna of Castile.[4](javascript:;)
**Blanca:** Queen Joanna? How do you know her?
**SCP-7704-1:** My father served the Catholic Crown[5](javascript:;) as a knight on the mainland and was preparing me to follow suit in their service of Aragon.
**Blanca:** Mainland?
**SCP-7704-1:** Oh, my apologies. My home is on the west side of Mallorca.
**Blanca:** One of the Balearic Islands?
**SCP-7704-1:** Correct.
**Blanca:** Oh, Iâve been there a couple of times. Mostly stayed in Palma.
**SCP-7704-1:** Palma is a good choice. More to do there.
**Blanca:** But you and your father as knights? Thatâs honestly amazing! You mustâve had a big name in your family.
**SCP-7704-1:** Yesâ¦ Our name. That must have explained why the steeds of Aragon approached our home and took him from us.
**Blanca:** What for?
**SCP-7704-1:** They were incoming ships from the Ottomans. They said he had to fight for God, his King, and his country. For us. He promised that he would return and when he didnât, my mother and I wereâ¦ lost for a time. When I grew to be a man, I served to honor his memory.
**Blanca:** Iâm sorry.
**SCP-7704-1:** I would do it all again. Although, I would have done it differently.
**Blanca:** Different how?
**SCP-7704-1:** To start, I would not have driven CatallÃ­na away.
_(Blanca does not respond.)_
**SCP-7704-1:** It was a boy, none I have ever met. He wasâ¦ with her. I grabbed a branch from **the unspoken trees,** wanting to bash it in his skull. CatallÃ­na got in the way, giving him time to flee. She insisted I stop and I struck her so hard that she was bleeding from her nose.
**Blanca:** You were angry. You couldn't have meant it.
**SCP-7704-1:** Regardless, I should never have done that. The day after, she was not in her room. I searched for months on end across Spain. Across **the forgotten place.** Searching for anything on where she might be but I knew she was with him. I found nothing, so when I returned home, my wife and son hated me.
_(SCP-7704-1 deeply inhales and exhales. There was a sudden bang from the receiver which startles Blanca.)_
**SCP-7704-1:** I- _(groans)_ why did I do that?
**Blanca:** Itâs okay, itâs fine. What about your mother? What did she think?
**SCP-7704-1:** She wasâ¦
**Blanca:** She was, what?
_(SCP-7704-1 remains silent for several seconds.)_
**Blanca:** Hello?
**SCP-7704-1:** Trying to remember.
_(SCP-7704-1 does not speak for 42 seconds. Tapping sounds could be heard. The beats increase in volume and sound more violent.)_
**SCP-7704-1:** Rememberâ¦ Rememberâ¦ Remember!
**Blanca:** What's happening there?
_(SCP-7704-1 shouts in pain.)_
**Blanca:** What did you do?!
**SCP-7704-1:** Let me see her! I beg of you!
**Blanca:** If you could please calm-
**SCP-7704-1:** I know you can hear me you fucking wench!
_(SCP-7704-1 continued to yell as loud as it could until it stopped. Sizzling can be heard and then sobbing.)_
**SCP-7704-1:** Help me, Blanca.
**Blanca:** How?
**SCP-7704-1:** Perhaps find my mother's house? It is near Manacor. Or was it Felanitx? **Or perhaps it was under the white hill?**
**Blanca:** Are you alright?
**SCP-7704-1:** Just please, her house is there.
**Blanca:** Are you sure?
**SCP-7704-1:** Yes, I am sure!
**Blanca:** It's just that you said you served Queen Joanna, right?
**SCP-7704-1:** What of it?
**Blanca:** It's- _(clears throat)_ been centuries since her time.
_(SCP-7704-1 does not respond.)_
**Blanca:** A lot has changed. We wouldn't know where to start looking or if any of her remains were left.
_(SCP-7704-1 still does not respond.)_
**Blanca:** I'm sorry, maybe I should check back later.

**Note:** The following is translated from Spanish to English

**< BEGIN LOG>**
**Blanca:** Good evening.
**SCP-7704-1:** Evening.
**Blanca:** How are you?
**SCP-7704-1:** Mmm.
**Blanca:** Mind telling me what was that about? Your outburst, I mean.
**SCP-7704-1:** What I saidâ¦ It was not meant for you and I am sorry for that.
**Blanca:** Itâs alright. Could I ask you something?
**SCP-7704-1:** What is it?
**Blanca:** Are you **an unnamed person?**
**SCP-7704-1:** No. I have a name.
**Blanca:** What is it?
**SCP-7704-1:** I amâ¦ Alvaro.
**Blanca:** You still talk like them, correct?
**SCP-7704-1:** My apologies. Old habits.
**Blanca:** No need to apologize. Iâm glad you told me. Is there anything I could do for you?
**SCP-7704-1:** Do you have any more music?
**Blanca:** Of course I do. In fact, I have something special.
_(Blanca begins playing a song.)_
**SCP-7704-1:** What is this one called?
**Blanca:** It's called "Mosas En La Casa" by Shakira. Let me tell you, my Ana _loves_ this woman.
**SCP-7704-1:** Shakira sounds lovely.
**Blanca:** Oh, that's not her.
**SCP-7704-1:** It's not?
**Blanca:** This is Ana's voice.
_(SCP-7704-1 remains silent as the music continues to play.)_
**SCP-7704-1:** Your daughter sounds beautiful.
**Blanca:** Oh, I know. She gets it from her father. Though, it's hard for her to sing like that nowadays.
**SCP-7704-1:** How so?
**Blanca:** She's been having breathing problems. But of course she would with all the singing she does. She'll be fine though.
**SCP-7704-1:** And you?
**Blanca:** Never had the time.
_(The music continues to play.)_
**SCP-7704-1:** She sang this last year for a show in her school. Good thing my ex-husband recorded it for me.
**SCP-7704-1:** You were not there?
**Blanca:** Like I said, I didn't have the time.
_(Pause.)_
**SCP-7704-1:** Why do you share this with me?
**Blanca:** I guess I thought it would cheer you up, butâ¦ I don't know.
_(They let the song continue to play until it ends.)_
**Blanca:** Have you ever told your kids everything you do for them? Especially for your work?
**SCP-7704-1:** I did. Never the battles, however. Never the chaos that came with it.
**Blanca:** I donât expect you to.
**SCP-7704-1:** For they do not need to know. They were my battles, not theirs. So yes, I did tell them that it was to keep them safe.
**Blanca:** Exactly.
**SCP-7704-1:** Though, I will say this, Blanca. Before I drove my daughter out, I promised them that I would always come back. I did not want to repeat what my father had done. Duty is a responsibility but my family was my life and I would have given anything to stay by their side for as long as I could.
**Blanca:** Were you able to keep that promise?
**SCP-7704-1:** No. I like to think so, and perhaps I did for a time. Perhaps it had run out, however, I hope that it was enoughâ¦ It is all about making what little time we have because God forbid anything happens to us or our children. Take this as advice from an old man.
_(Pause.)_
**Blanca:** I think weâve said enough for today.

No matter what project you put me in, itâs not going to change anything. Besides, I am making progress with SCP-7704-1 and I have to finish this. Stopping now would mean that we wasted our time and energy on nothing. What it said caught me off guard, Iâll try to keep a level head going forward. You say you got my back.

**< BEGIN LOG>**
**Blanca:** Evening.
**SCP-7704-1:** You do not sound thrilled.
**Blanca:** Mmm. I'm just tired, is all. But enough about me, how have you been?
**SCP-7704-1:** Me? I am doing better, strangely.
**Blanca:** Oh yeah?
**SCP-7704-1:** Itâs been too long since I have heard something other than these roaring flames. I appreciate it very much, Blanca.
**Blanca:** Call me LÃ­a.
**SCP-7704-1** LÃ­aâ¦ Blanca. A beautiful name.
**Blanca:** Thatâs kind of you to say.
**SCP-7704-1:** You have my gratitude, LÃ­a. And as for our last meeting, had I upset you?
**Blanca:** You didnât. I just never thought I'd be having these lengthy talks about stuff like this.
_(Pause.)_
**Blanca:** I hope I have enough time.
**SCP-7704-1:** Believe that you do.
**Blanca:** I got another song thatâs one of my favorites. You wanna give it a go?
**SCP-7704-1:** Please.
_(Blanca plays Amor Eterno by RocÃ­o DÃºrcal. Blanca and SCP-7704-1 listen for 6 minutes and 17 seconds until the song concludes.)_
**SCP-7704-1:** My Godâ¦
**Blanca:** So? What do you think?
(_SCP-7704-1 does not respond for 3 minutes and 12 seconds before speaking through the receiver._)
**SCP-7704-1:** _(Sniffs)_ Oh my God, Iâm sorry. I just _(shakey exhales)_ wished that I had done so much differently.
**Blanca:** Hey, itâs okay.
_(SCP-7704-1 continues to collect itself.)_
**SCP-7704-1:** I should have never gone to that port.
**Blanca:** What port?
**SCP-7704-1:** The Port of MahÃ³n. The Crown sent me to join three hundred or so men to defend it from invading Ottomans.[6](javascript:;) Some of my friends were thereâ¦
_(SCP-7704-1 takes deep breaths.)_
**SCP-7704-1:** God, we were being slaughtered. Of course, we would. Against that many? What were they thinking?! And those fucking worms chose to surrender all of us just so they may be spared! I should have burned them with all the rest!
**Blanca:** Burned them?
**SCP-7704-1:** Forgive me, I- I need a moment.
_(SCP-7704-1takes 22 seconds to itself before speaking.)_
**SCP-7704-1:** They took me away to their ship. Along with the few surviving knights and civilians. We were their slaves, and we were on our way to their markets.
**Blanca:** Oh my God.
**SCP-7704-1:** Do you pray, LÃ­a?
**Blanca:** I do.
**SCP-7704-1:** And have those prayers come true?
**Blanca:** â¦ One time, I remember Ana found out her boyfriend cheated on her. You could say that I wanted to kill him, like you. While my ex-husband was making sure she was okay, I asked God to bring justice down upon him for breaking my daughterâs heart. The next two days, Anaâs friends told her, then told me, that he sliced his fingers in a carpenting workshop. I wanted to laugh when I heard that.
**SCP-7704-1:** I see.
**Blanca:** Does that make me a bad person?
**SCP-7704-1:** Hardly. At least to me.
_(Neither of them spoke for 12 seconds.)_
**Blanca:** So how did you escape?
**SCP-7704-1:** She promised she would help me. She said I had to burn the bracelet CatallÃ­na made for me. She showed me **the forbidden home. I did everything she asked of me. I waited for him as I followed the pale road to meet the one that would grant me a new body to have.**
**SCP-7704-1:** **I had a stone in hand. When I gave my name, it shattered and I saw myself lying on one of the unknown trees. I grabbed another stone and beat my own head with it until I no longer moved.** Because I am Alvaroâ¦ I am Alvaro.
**Blanca:** Who promised you?
_(No response.)_
**Blanca:** Hello?
**SCP-7704-1:** She was an angel. Beautiful like the summer sky. Warm to the touchâ¦ That vile, lying whore. I pray that you bled to your death.

SCP-7704-1 did not respond to further questions from Blanca after this interview.
Gamma-6 ("Deep Feeders") was utilized to traverse SCP-7704 with Atmospheric Diving Suits layered with Aluminized Carbon Kevlar. The suits had a built-in cooling insulation system to regulate the internal temperature of up to 35Â°C so that the user could operate it with little difficulty when entering SCP-7704. It will also have an external temperature display to notify the user when they approach the maximum temperature of 1000Â°C. KEPLER-200s and the ZION-A400s were also implemented within the suit for wireless communication.
17 minutes later, Gamma-6 resurfaced and was immediately sent to the Emergency Cabin with G6-3 suffering from sudden Heat Exhaustion. The suits had also been damaged due to the insulation system's prolonged exposure to extreme temperatures and requiring repair or improvements. Since then, The Foundation has ceased traversal until further notice.
* * *
### Addendum-2: Exerpts
* * *
During the production of the AD suits, Blanca gathered a small crew to travel across Europe as well as North Africa to search for instances relating to SCP-7704-1 and confirm its claims. After 3 months, Blanca and her crew had compiled a series of excerpts in the order of their year.
[â¼ Open Documents â¼](javascript:;)

1535,
I was up on the sails to maintain them during a storm. My crewmates and I battled the winds and waves while some men were washed off board. Down the decks, I saw this bright blue light from where we held our stock and then it quickly vanished.
After the storm, I searched the bottom decks and found that one of our slaves from Mahon had gone missing. He was a sickly looking one. I had thought that he had escaped during the storm. I thought him dead.
Some days later, we were at sea. The night was quiet, mind the winds and crashing waves on the wood. Then the ship had caught a blaze from below and had already been engulfing our ship. Some of them fell through the decks, others got caught in the fires. I managed to take a boat and escape the burning ship. I looked to see other ships had also been set on fire.
I heard a man laughing from the sky. His voice sounded familiar to me, but I could not recall where from then. I looked up and saw two bright stars, one green and one blue. I could not tell which one of them was laughing but I rowed my boat just in time before the ship sank. By the time I was ashore, I recognized the voice.
I will not go back to Europe so that the mad stars would burn me.
1539,
From demands of the Crown, an investigation in Madrid ensued on the fifteenth of April.
There was a gathering of its people. Getting past the crowd, there was a man who was tall and donned a green cloak. His face could not be seen as his cloak covered the majority of his face. A local man asked if he was The Lord himself, but he replied, âI am but a servant.â
Next to him was a woman with a blue cloak. Her shoulders and head were exposed but I could not make out her face as the white light above her head blinded us from gazing upon it. One could feel the warm heat coming from her as she cradled many in her arms.
Perhaps I have seen Angels at work. Elders were turning young, the sick and injured were healed. The people's pockets were filled with gold and silver coins. The blue woman appeared behind me and asked if there was anything I desired.
I wished to be reunited with my late wife. I never, never, would have imagined that she would return to me seconds later. It was her. It was truly her.
To the Catholic Crown, God is with us.
1540,
Bless our Lord, for he has given us life again. Horrible things were happening all across France. Storms blew and washed away homes, the earth ruptured and broke, fires to farms and forests, and disease swept us all. The Lord heeded our prayers and bestowed two angels to rid the works of The Devil.
Our devotion, loyalty, and undying love could not measure the debt we had for our Saviors. One was a beauty that had brought the sun to us while she cradled us in her cloak. The other one was more hidden but he too shared his love for us by answering our prayers.
Rejoice for France has been blessed!
1542,
These are the end times, as they were written. I saw them battling at the foot of the Watzmann mountain. One of Godâs Angels and The Dragon took their war down to us. He had lifted the earth and crushed it on top of her. Conjuring ice, stone, and steel to puncture her, yet she still stood.
He had done everything in his power to kill her, but this Angel was as beautiful as she was powerful.
I cannot, for the life of me, describe what he did near the end. But it was power unlike anything nature could ever bestow. I felt the force soon after and it blew away the storms. When I got out of the ditch, I noticed that he was fatigued. Which gave The Angel the chance to fire an arrow of light through him.
Over time, The Devil was becoming smaller until it was the size of a man. He was screaming curses at her. She was torn into a bloodied mess, and yet she covered him with her cloak. She must have whispered something in his ear before summoning the sun and caging the evil within.
She flew South, perhaps going to return the beast from once it came. I pray for her that God will heal her wounds.
Dear Father,
It has been years since I last saw you. When you struck me, I was scared. I thought that had I stayed, I would be punished further for lying to you. Perhaps I would have. I also supposed that I thought he loved me, as I had loved him. The first signs of me conceiving a child, he was gone. I then had my son, whom I named after you, and we had been on our own for Lord knows how long. I did what I must to care for us and there was a point when I thought myself better dead.
We somehow made our way to a French village. It was nice for a time until a raging storm had us in its midst. Then the earth beneath us crumbled and I fell in. I was cold, trapped in my unmoving body. Then I felt warm again and saw you in front of me. It was your voice, low yet soothing. You were different. Green skin, four black eyes. But it was you and I never bawled like I did since I was a girl.
I wanted nothing but to have you as my father again, and then I gazed upon the woman who was with you. She was so pretty, yet I could feel her eyes piercing through my soul. I recall her voice, as soft, if not softer than yours when she said, âYou belong to me.â Who was she father?
Then you both vanished, and I never got to say farewell. I do not know what she did to you, but if you are watching over me, know that I forgive you. And that I love you, always.
Forever yours,
-CatallÃ­na

**Blanca:** After our last interview, I went to find out what happened after that Ottoman ship. Found me some other things too. So who was that âAngelâ?
_(SCP-7704-1 says nothing.)_
**Blanca:** You hate her that much?
**SCP-7704-1:** After what she did to me. To all those people. To my CatallÃ­na. She deserves to be in Hell.
**Blanca:** They say you and her helped people.
**SCP-7704-1:** Inflicting diseases and disasters only to resolve them to take the glory? How was that helping?
**Blanca:** You couldnât stop her?
**SCP-7704-1:** I was her servant. Up until she wished that I sunk a village in France.

**Mosa:** They also noted your leaning interest in SCP-7704-1.
**Blanca:** Interest in what way?
**Mosa:** They say that, during your findings of these documents, specifically in Spain and France, you initially planned on returning sooner. But as you said, you wanted to be efficient. Could explain why you bothered finding the excerpt from Germany and the letter.
**Blanca:** Whatâs your point?
**Mosa:** Took me a while to think it over. It's not that you're attached to it. No, you want something from it, donât you?
_Blanca remains silent for a time_
**Blanca:** You know why. I thought you had my back?
**Mosa:** This is me having your back. It's why we put her on chemotherapy.
**Blanca:** Do you know what she says? She says it's painful. She says she's tiredâ¦ She wants to stop.
**Mosa:** Itâs a process, but she can get through it.
**Blanca:** And what if it doesnât work? What if weâre too late? What if this can save Ana?
**Mosa:** LÃ­a, youâre asking me to just let you use an anomaly, _a very powerful anomaly_ , however and whenever we want. Thatâs cruel, and youâre not cruel. Besides, will it even accept your wish? Do we even know if it has side effects?
**Blanca:** SCP-7704-1 says it's a servant. And what side effects? Look at what these people wrote about it. SCP-7704-1 can do it.
**Mosa:** Okay, and we still have to go through fire thatâs burning way hotter than it should. Our AD suits arenât ready for that yetâ¦ Iâm not going to lose both of you.
**Blanca:** Then help me! Please, I need this. I need you.
_Pause._
**Mosa:** Youâre not going in there. Thatâs an order. For the safety of The Foundation, its staff, and you, Iâll be appointing you to a lighter project. Away from this area. If you come back here, I will use force. You really donât want to test me on that.
**Blanca:** Rodrigoâ¦ You canât.
**Mosa:** Go home, LÃ­a. Let's just try to be with her while she still has time.

[â² Close Director Mosa Meeting â²](javascript:;)
**From:** **[UKNOWN]**
**To:** tni.pcs|oisiromp#tni.pcs|oisiromp
**Subject:** Disable Security
* * *
Philippe,
Tonight at 4 a.m., disable all of the security systems. If not or if you tell anyone about this email, then Iâll show everyone what you do at âThe Palaceâ. Iâm glad to know that you donât do anything illegal or harm others, but what you do is still absolutely disgusting.
On 05/19/2004 at 4 a.m., all security systems such as cameras and motion detectors were temporarily down by Head of Security, Philippe Morisio for 6 minutes. Once the systems were running again, security personnel reported a missing uniform and weapon from the locker rooms. The site had to be on lockdown to locate the infiltrator. Eventually, security found that the storage unit that held the AD suits was opened with one of the suits also missing. Task Forces immediately were sent to the location of SCP-7704 to capture the infiltrator. By the time they got there, they found the missing uniform and the weapon which had not been fired. The Task Force reported their findings and Director Rodrigo Mosa quickly went to the communications room.

**< BEGIN LOG>**
(_Blanca descends into the containment of SCP-7704. She then enters through one of the doors and approaches it. She stops as she observes the massive flames that boil the dome. She proceeds to step foot into SCP-7704 and march onward._)
**Mosa:** What the hell are you doing?!
**Blanca:** I have to do this.
**Mosa:** Resurface right now!
_(Blanca says nothing.)_
**Mosa:** I can't protect you if The Council gets word of this.
**Blanca:** Fine.
**Mosa:** What do you mean, âfineâ?! LÃ­a, Iâm ordering you to resurface!
_(Blanca says nothing.)_
**Mosa:** What about Ana? What do you want me to say to her?
_(Blanca says nothing.)_
**Mosa:** LÃ­a, please! Say something!
**Blanca:** Iâm sorry. For everything that happened between us.
**Mosa:** â¦ Iâm sorry too. LÃ­a, Iâm begging you. Come back and weâll figure it out together.
**Blanca:** I love you both.
_(Blanca mutes communication with Mosa. As she walks, her visor reads the temperature of the interior suit at 11Â°C. Oxygen: 91%)_
**Blanca:** So far, so good.
_(She marches for about 12 minutes as the interior temperature reads 15Â°C. Nothing else except the red, orange, and yellow flames are visible. Her breathing becomes slow and steady. Her visor rings a call from Mosa though she does not answer. Oxygen: 72%)_
_(Another 4 minutes have gone by and the interior suits temperature 24Â°C. Oxygen is at 68%. Her heavy breathing continues as the oxygen slowly depletes from her visor. The internal cooling system fails and starts to malfunction. Her breathing starts to get faster, and her oxygen is at 50%. 2 minutes later, the interior temperature is 31Â°C with Oxygen at 49%. Blanca increases her speed and screams, most likely from the burns. She does this for another 3 minutes.)_
_(She finally falls. The visor flashes a warning that the suit's resistance has reached its maxed temperature of 40Â°C. Blanca crawls for another 20 seconds before finally being dragged out from the flames. Blanca is turned to lay on her back with SCP-7704-1 looking down at her. SCP-7704-1 is tall and lanky. Its skin has different shades of green with four black eyes. Its arms are black and charred, and its legs are thin and do not seem to have any feet._)
**SCP-7704-1:** LÃ­a?
_(Blanca tries to speak but her breathing wheezes. SCP-7704-1 puts his hands on the helmet and turns it until it is removed. SCP-7704-1 places the helmet beside the pair, showing that the suit is heavily damaged from the flames. )_
**Blanca:** _(Wheezes)_ Whatâ¦ are you?
**SCP-7704-1:** A servant of the Catholic Crown, Queen Mab, The Angel, CatallÃ­na, and now you. That is Alvaro.
_(Blanca grabs on the collar and tugs it. SCP-7704-1 helps Blanca out of her suit by unlocking the pins from the suit and lifting the top half. SCP-7704-1 pulls her out from the suit with Blanca having third-degree burns all over her body.)_
**SCP-7704-1:** LÃ­a, make a wish to save yourself.
**Blanca:** _(Shakily)_ Alvaroâ¦ I wishâ¦ for Ana Mosa to be curedâ¦ Please.
_(The flames grow brighter with a high pitched ring that is audible for 5 seconds.)_
**SCP-7704-1:** It is done.
_(Blancaâs breathing is not heard. SCP-7704-1 taps on her face and shakes her.)_
**SCP-7704-1:** LÃ­a? Wake up. _(It shakes her body)_ Wake up. LÃ­a? LÃ­a! No, no, no, no, no, no! Come back! Come back! Is there anyone else? Please come down here! You need to make a wish! Anyone?!
_(SCP-7704-1 starts to cry and holds her body for an embrace. The footage abruptly cuts to black with no audio.)_

After surveying Ana Mosa's aftercare, her recovery to normalcy from her Stage 4 Lung Cancer has been much quicker compared to chemotherapy. It is unknown what other side effects Ana gained from SCP-7704-1 and must be monitored carefully.

_(SCP-7704-1 does not respond. Neither says anything for 4 minutes.)_
**Mosa:** LÃ­aâ¦ you could bring her back, right?
**SCP-7704-1:** If that is what you wish.
_(Neither say anything for 2 minutes.)_
**SCP-7704-1:** I will be waiting for you.
